{"data": ["films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there's never really been a comic book like from hell before . \nfor starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid '80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . \nto say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . \nthe book ( or \" graphic novel , \" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . \nin other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source . \nif you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell's directors , albert and allen hughes . \ngetting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ? \nthe ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london's east end . \nit's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called \" unfortunates \" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision . \nwhen the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case . \nabberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium . \nupon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it isn't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can't stomach . \ni don't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i won't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay . \nin the comic , they don't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end . \nit's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts . \nand from hell's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( \" who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star ? \" ) . \ndon't worry - it'll all make sense when you see it . \nnow onto from hell's appearance : it's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) . \nthe print i saw wasn't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( don't say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic . \noscar winner martin childs' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place . \neven the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent . \nians holm ( joe gould's secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians ) log in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is graham . \ni cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it actually wasn't half bad . \nthe film , however , is all good . \n2 : 00 - r for strong violence/gore , sexuality , language and drug content \n", "every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio , with every indication that it will be a stinker , and to everybody's surprise ( perhaps even the studio ) the film becomes a critical darling . \nmtv films' _election , a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon , is a current example . \ndid anybody know this film existed a week before it opened ? \nthe plot is deceptively simple . \ngeorge washington carver high school is having student elections . \ntracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an over-achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question , way , way , high . \nmr . \" m \" ( matthew broderick ) , sick of the megalomaniac student , encourages paul , a popular-but-slow jock to run . \nand paul's nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well , for personal reasons . \nthe dark side of such sleeper success is that , because expectations were so low going in , the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be . \nyou can't help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews , which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have . \n_election , a good film , does not live up to its hype . \nwhat makes _election_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from _rushmore_ , released a few months earlier . \nthe similarities are staggering : \ntracy flick ( _election_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . \nmax fischer ( _rushmore_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . \nthe most significant tension of _election_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . \nthe most significant tension of _rushmore_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . \ntracy flick is from a single parent home , which has contributed to her drive . \nmax fischer is from a single parent home , which has contributed to his drive . \nthe male bumbling adult in _election_ ( matthew broderick ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . \nhe even gets a bee sting . \nthe male bumbling adult in _rushmore_ ( bill murray ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . \nhe gets several bee stings . \nand so on . \nwhat happened ? \nhow is it that an individual screenplay ( _rushmore_ ) and a novel ( _election_ ) contain so many significant plot points , and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other , made from two different studios , from a genre ( the high school geeks revenge movie ) that hadn't been fully formed yet ? \neven so , the strengths of _election_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick , witherspoon , and newcomer jessica campbell , as paul's anti-social sister , tammy . \nbroderick here is playing the mr . rooney role from _ferris bueller_ , and he seems to be having the most fun he's had since then . \nwitherspoon is a revelation . \nit's early in the year , it's a comedy , and teenagers have little clout , but for my money , witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination . \nand once campbell's character gets going , like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium , then you're won over . \none thing that's been bothering me since i've seen it . \nthere is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film . \ni suppose that , coming from mtv films , i should expect no less . . . \nbut the film starts off light and airy , like a sitcom . \nas the screws tighten , and the tensions mount , alexander payne decides to add elements that , frankly , distract from the story . \nit is bad enough that mr . m doesn't like tracy's determination to win at all costs , but did they have to throw in the student/teacher relationship ? \neven so , there's no logical reason why mr . m has an affair when he does . \nthere's a lot to like in _election_ , but the plot similarities to _rushmore_ , and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex-driven , mark this as a disappointment . \n", "you've got mail works alot better than it deserves to . \nin order to make the film a success , all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars , have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits . \nno real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it's body ( it's basically a complete re-shoot of the shop around the corner , only adding a few modern twists ) . \nessentially , it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking . \nit's overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy , not to mention very manipulative . \nbut oh , how enjoyable that manipulation is . \nbut there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does , because i absolutely hated the previous ryan/hanks teaming , sleepless in seattle . \nit couldn't have been the directing , because both films were helmed by the same woman . \ni haven't quite yet figured out what i liked so much about you've got mail , but then again , is that really important ? \nif you like something so much , why even question it ? \nagain , the storyline is as cliched as they come . \ntom hanks plays joe fox , the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley , the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a family-run children's book shop called , in a nice homage , the shop around the corner . \nfox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business . \nlittle do they know , they are already in love with each other over the internet , only neither party knows the other person's true identity . \nthe rest of the story isn't important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen . \nsure , there are some mildly interesting subplots , but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship . \nall of this , of course , leads up to the predictable climax . \nbut as foreseeable as the ending is , it's so damn cute and well-done that i doubt any movie in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does . \nwhen ryan discovers the true identity of her online love , i was filled with such , for lack of a better word , happiness that for the first time all year , i actually left the theater smiling . \n", " \" jaws \" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen . \nthe movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds . \nthen it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams' now infamous score . \ndah-dum . \nfrom there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly . \nright away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once \" jaws \" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip . \nperhaps what is most outstanding about \" jaws \" is how spielberg builds the movie . \nhe works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act . \nunlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act . \nuntil then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams' music . \nhe's building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark's arrival is truly terrifying . \nhe doesn't let us get bored with the imagery . \nthe first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn't been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years . \nthe island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn't want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money . \nbrody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute . \nhooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( \" it's a perfect engine , an eating machine \" ) make it that much more terrifying . \nwhen vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark . \nthe entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it . \n \" jaws \" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror . \nit is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it's no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by \" star wars \" ) . \neven today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock's \" psycho , \" and it never seems to age . \nalthough grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill . \nthe technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects . \nscheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time \" jaws \" was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman . \nnevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark . \nscheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what's right and going against the entire town . \n \" it's your first summer here , you know , \" mayor vaughn warns him . \ndreyfuss , who had previously been seen in \" american graffiti \" ( 1973 ) and \" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz \" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers . \nhowever , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie's captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards . \nbordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism . \nhe's slightly deranged , and shaw's performance is almost a caricature . \nhowever , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars . \nquint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s . \nindianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese . \nhis tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen . \nshaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film . \nof course , we can't leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind's fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature . \na shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in \" jaws , \" and they are a threat . \nevery one of spielberg's subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into . \nthe shark in \" jaws \" was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed \" bruce \" by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles . \nmany have forgotten , but \" jaws \" was a sort of precursor to \" waterworld \" ( 1995 ) , a movie's who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb . \nbut , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood . \n", "moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post-salary cap era -- you've got to know how to allocate your resources . \nevery dollar spent on a free-agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers . \nin the nfl , this leads to teams like the detroit lions , who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract , but can only field five guys named herb to block for him . \nin the movies , you end up with films like \" spawn \" , with a huge special-effects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors . \njackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking . \nhe spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line . \nwatching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid , fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars , is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit , except that sanders doesn't have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages . \nbut like the lions star , jackie doesn't have anybody to block for him . \nalmost every cent that's invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts , and as chan does his own stunts , the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills . \nthis leaves about 75 cents to pay for things like directors ( chan directs ) , scripts and dubbing and supporting characters , not to mention the hideous title sequence . \nthis also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain . \n ( chan's first release in this country , \" rumble in the bronx \" , was supposedly set in new york , but was filmed in vancouver , and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible . ) \nheck , jackie doesn't even have enough money for a haircut , looks like , much less a personal hairstylist . \nin condor , chan plays the same character he's always played , himself , a mixture of bruce lee and tim allen , a master of both kung-fu and slapstick-fu . \njackie is sent by the un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert , and is chased by a horde of neo-nazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs ( one of the things i like about jackie chan movies : no political correctness ) . \nhe is joined by three women , who have little to do except scream , \" jackie , save us ! \" , and misuse firearms . \nthe villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere , and he's more pathetic than evil . \nen route , we have an extended motorcycle chase scene , a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with the neo-nazis , and two confrontations with savage natives . \nonce at the secret desert base , there is a long chop-socky sequence , followed by the film's centerpiece , a wind-tunnel fight that's even better than the one in face/off . \nthis is where the money was spent , on well-choreographed kung-fu sequences , on giant kevlar hamster balls , on smashed-up crates of bananas , and on scorpions . \nignore the gaping holes in the plot ( how , exactly , if the villain's legs were broken , did he escape from the secret nazi base , and why didn't he take the key with him ? ) . \ndon't worry about the production values , or what , exactly , the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara . \njust go see the movie . \noperation condor has pretentions of being a \" raiders of the lost ark \" knockoff , but one wonders what jackie could do with the raiders franchise blocking for him -- with a lawrence kazdan screenplay , a john williams score , spielberg directing and george lucas producing , condor might be an a+ movie . \nhowever , you've got to go with what you've got , and what you've got in jackie chan is something special -- a talent that mainstream hollywood should , could , and ought to utilize . \n", "on june 30 , 1960 , a self-taught , idealistic , yet pragmatic , young man became , at age 36 , the first head of government of a newly independent african state , formerly the belgian congo . \ntwo months later , he was ousted from his powerful position and hunted by government troops until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides . \nthis little-known story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in \" lumumba . \" \npatrice lumumba's ( eriq ebouaney ) story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary , \" lumumba - death of a prophet , \" virtually guaranteeing that his new , fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject . \npeck , with co-writer pascal bonitzer , begins at the end of the story of the young political leader . \nwe watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men . \nimages of hatchets , saws and fast-emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image . \njump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian-owned congo . \na third class postal worker , lumumba , speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes , proclaiming himself not tribal , not regional , but a national leader . \nhis small , mobile party , the congolese national movement ( mnc ) is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer , and get his face known , in the bustling capital , stanleyville . \nat a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world , lumumba is in the right place at the right time and , through political savvy and chess-like manipulation , achieves a position of leadership of the mnc . \nas the date for independence approaches , he tactically positions himself to be the new nation's first prime minister and defense minister , supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) . \nthe coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country's vast natural resources of copper , diamonds , gold and more . \nlumumba won't seek the help of the us , knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government . \nhis initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination . \nthe situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies , the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves , belgian troops violently intervene , the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad . \nthis tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes-odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries . \npeck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba , his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50's and 60's . \n ( during the time the story takes place , many new nations , including nigeria and somalia , were born , with varying degrees of success and failure , usually dependent upon which country colonized them . \nsome colonial masters were better than others . ) \nthe effort involved in \" lumumba \" is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades , if at all . \nproduction values are first rate on what must be a small , by us standards , budget . \nthe period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique . \nthe screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeoman's work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba's life . \nthe political side of things is evenly told in a linear , straightforward manner that teaches , not preaches . \nit concentrates on the good deeds of the man , if a bit as a stalwart saint , but doesn't embellish on a larger than life persona . \nthe family side of patrice's life is handled in several , perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children , embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child . \ni know the intent is to flesh the man out , but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba . \nthe story , as such , has a lopsided feel about it . \nhigh marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character . \nthe actor gives a convincing , charismatic performance as the multifaceted , politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions . \nin true docudrama tradition , the supporting cast does not outshine the star , complementing his good efforts , instead . \n \" lumumba \" is a solid , interesting , educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos , both . \nit has more intelligence in its telling than anything i've seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a b+ . \n", "apparently , director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film , american history x . i don't know the details of the fight , but it seems that he is not happy with the final product , and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether . \ni've heard about this kind of thing happening before , and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce . \nas it is , i found american history x to be an extremely good film , not just because of tony kaye's focused look at the touchy subject of racism , but because of a powerful , charismatic performance from edward norton . \nit's hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton's fantastic role in primal fear , but , here he is now , starring in his own film and making himself a star . \nnorton is one of those performers who becomes his character , and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year . \nhe plays a young man named derek vinyard , a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother , danny ( edward furlong ) , mother ( beverly d'angelo ) , and sister , davin ( jennifer lien ) . \nthe film opens with a flashback , in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car . \nwe find out that this lands him in prison , and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny . \nin the present-time of the film , danny is in high school , and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother . \nmuch of the film is told in flashback , and we see the path that leads to derek's adoption of white supremacy . \nwhen derek is released , having served three years in prison , he finds that his brother is now a full-blown skinhead ; derek , however , has given up the violence , and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things . \nwhat makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid , thoughtless people -- they are intelligent and articulate , and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms . \nit's hard to make a controversial movie and not preach , but kaye has found the right note for his material . \nbecause american history x is a mainstream film , there has to be a redemption phase for our main character -- some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic . \ni partially disagree with this , because , although i do not advocate racism in any way , it's interesting the way kaye presents derek -- he is a loud , obnoxious man , but he's also very smart . \nthe reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable -- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men . \nit's clear that he's passionate about his beliefs , and that he's not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up . \nof course , it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part . \nit's astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest . \nin addition to getting the look just right , he's perfect for this role -- derek requires intelligence , depth , and a whole lot of shouting , and norton does it all with ease . \neven when he's at his meanest , derek has a likable quality to him , and that's a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead . \nwhat adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny's school ( avery brooks ) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny . \nthe other performances are all terrific , with standouts from furlong , d'angelo , and lien . \nvisually , the film is very powerful . \nkaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices , and most of them work nicely -- lots of slow-motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere . \nbut , like a lot of movies lately , american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes . \nalthough the climactic scene is very moving , the picture ends with a pretentious , preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed . \nfor a movie so smart a subtle up until that point , it felt like a slap in the face to be hand-fed a theme in such a simplistic way . \nit makes me wonder what , exactly , tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film . \nperhaps this last scene was the problem . \nit's hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good -- in a time when so many movies are timid and weak , american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way . \n", "one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy's wedding . \nand she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it . \nher reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald , who hasn't made a worthwhile film since 1986 . \nbut the fact is , betsy's wedding is also an alan alda film . \nand while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years , alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects , including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life . \nwritten and directed by alda , betsy's wedding is a vibrant slice-of-life , mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor . \nalda's comic elixir is smooth and refreshing--and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare . \nas bride and groom , molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film , but they are by far the least interesting . \nwalsh is a nonentity , with all the screen presence of a door knob . \nringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain . \nshe looks hideous with her short-cropped orange hair , red lip-stick and grotesque outfits . \nshe's supposed to be a dress designer , but she looks more like a clown . \nand to make matters worse , ringwald's performance matches her appearance . \nthankfully , alda keeps ringwald's screen time to a minimum ; he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters . \nthe wedding is just a device to bring together the bride's working-class , italian family and the groom's rich , gentile family . \nringwald's folks are homey and down-to-earth , with alda as her free-spirited father , madeline kahn as her practical mother , and ally sheedy as her lonely sister . \nwalsh's clan , on the other hand , is prim , proper and ostentatious . \nwhen the two families meet and mingle , the movie becomes a story of culture clash , or as one character puts it , \" money versus values . \" \nally sheedy , in a wonderfully understated performance , is one of the film's most pleasant surprises . \nsheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body . \nit's anthony lapaglia , however , who seizes the spotlight . \nlapaglia plays stevie dee , a suave , overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old-fashioned chivalry . \nlapaglia's sincere but dim-witted character is a riot . \nand what's uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro , with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure . \nlapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting , and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role-model and partly a rip-off . \ni don't know whether to say a star is born or a star is re-born , but i do know that lapaglia's over-the-top performance should not be missed . \nthe scrumptious comic acting , however , extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia . \njoe pesci , in particular , sinks his teeth into his role as alda's unscrupulous brother-in-law , a slum lord with mob ties , who is cheating on his wife ( catherine o'hara ) . \nalda , faced with challenge of both directing and acting , somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride's financially-strapped father , a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet . \nthe film adopts alda's psychological point of view as he tries to one : plan the wedding , and two : pay for it . \nas a filmmaker , alda's style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful . \nand while he doesn't have the comic genius of a woody allen , alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy . \n", "after bloody clashes and independence won , lumumba refused to pander to the belgians , who continued a condescending and paternalistic relationship with the congo . \ntheir officers , particularly general janssens ( rudi delhem ) in the force

province of katanga , which contained 70 percent of the country's resources , proclaimed secession . \nlumumba replaced janssens , making mobutu a colonel , and went on a pacification \ntour with congolese president joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) , but it was too late . \n'when you want to drown a dog , you say it has rabies , ' prophesies lumumba of his own fate . \npeck and bonitzer do an exemplary job telling a complicated tale with a myriad of players , although they frequently succumb to cliche , particularly regarding lumumba's private life . \npeck's script illuminates bantu sayings like 'the hand that gives , rules' when lumumba uses it with the american ambassador . \npeck's direction is less assured , with many scenes unfortunately playing like standard television fare . \nhe's served well , though , by his casting of ebouaney in the title role . \nebouaney is dynamic , radiating his character's fierce passion for his people and his country . \nlumumba's intelligence and ability to strategize , even as he's cornered by insurmountable odds , are given life by ebouaney . \npeck's subject and lead actor elevate his film above its mediocre production . \n \" lumumba \" is a story that deserves to be told and ebouaney's performance makes the tragedy personally felt . \n", "the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire-fu copycats . \nit's not a pretty death , and it's leaving the likes of schwartznager , stallone , and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea . \nsometimes , the mix results in a mind-blowing spectacle unlike any other . \nquality action with amazing and exciting stunt work , as in 1999's the matrix , can be a real gem . \nbut too often hollywood gets it wrong , even when they pay off chinese directors . \nflying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists . \nmostly it's laughable . \nin hollywood's rush to emulate the success of the matrix , trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form . \nbut iron monkey , the latest asian import , shows us how to get it right . \niron monkey ( actually a reissue of a 1993 film ) is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante ( rongguang yu ) , fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry . \nbut it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong fei-hong , most recently seen in one of the most overlooked , and possibly best films of 2000 , drunken master 2 ( released in the u . s . as the legend of drunken master ) . \nunlike drunken master 2 , which stars jackie chan as an adult fei-hong , iron monkey finds a much younger fei-hong ( sze-man tsang ) and his father wong kei-ying ( yen chi dan ) thrust into the middle of iron monkey's fight against oppression . \niron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2 . at times , fighting styles , especially that of monkey himself , do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle-toed floating of films like crouching tiger , hidden dragon , director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth . \niron monkey is at its heart a hardcore , kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger . \nhowever , there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters , such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his good-hearted but misguided enemy , chief fox . \nin those moments , and in others , iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience . \nwhile in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master 2 , iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune . \naka siunin wong fei-hung tsi titmalau . \n", "after watching \" rat race \" last week , i noticed my cheeks were sore and realized that , when not laughing aloud , i had held a grin for virtually all of the film's 112 minutes . \nsaturday night , i attended another sneak preview for the movie and damned if i didn't enjoy it as much the second time as the first . \n \" rat race \" is a great goofy delight , a dandy mix of energetic performances , inspired sight gags and flat-out silliness . \nhands down , this is the most fun film of the summer . \nthe movie begins with zippy retro-style opening credits that look like they were torn straight out of a '60s slapstick comedy , featuring animated photos of the cast attached to herky-jerky bodies bounding around the screen . \nthen comes the setup . \ndonald sinclair ( john cleese ) , the extremely rich owner of the venetian hotel and casino in las vegas , enjoys concocting unusual bets for his high rolling clients . \nto that end , he places a half dozen very special tokens in his slot machines . \ngathering together the lucky token holders , he explains , \"

$2 million in cash . \nthere is a transmitter in every key , so that sinclair and his cronies can keep track of who is ahead . \nthe race has no rules ? whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets the money . \nsince it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes , let's use the next few paragraphs to profile the racers . \ndecked out in flashy , trashy clothing and sporting big hair , vera baker ( whoopi goldberg ) is in town to reunite with the daughter she gave up for adoption as a baby . \nshe finds that grown-up merrill ( lanai chapman ) is erudite , conservative and more than a little bit wary of this stranger trying to jump into her life . \nthrown together , it becomes clear that both women share a fierce competitive nature . \nowen templeton ( cuba gooding jr . ) is currently the most hated man in america . \nan nfl referee , he cost gamblers all over the country enormous amounts of money by blowing a call in a high-profile game . \nafter escaping from a vengeful

carrying a human heart across country for a transplant operation . \nrandy pear ( jon lovitz ) promised his wife beverly ( kathy najimy ) and two kids a fun-filled vacation in las vegas . \nfearful

vegas where sinclair and mr . grisham ( dave thomas ) , his personality-impaired right hand man , continue cooking up bizarre bets for the gamblers . \nas with any zucker production , a few jokes fall flat , but the momentum of the comedy zooms past those missteps . \nhigh points for me include a bit involving kathy bates as a roadside squirrel salesperson and an intricately set up gag that carries jon lovitz and family from a bizarre museum to an outdoor rally , with an utterly tasteless and screamingly funny pay-off . \nhad i been part of the filmmaking team , i would have ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a baby's clothes and instead had the key get lost in the cleavage of a dozing society matron . \nit would have drawn the same laugh without the squirm-inducing hint of child molestation . \ni also would have selected a different band for a concert sequence . \nmy god , do we really need yet another movie with smash mouth performing \" all star ? \" \nbut enough carping . \n \" rat race \" is a riot , with terrific no-holds-barred performances from the diverse cast . \nsee it , see it again and when the dvd comes out , buy it , because a movie this hilarious will surely have outtakes to die for . \n", "i've noticed something lately that i've never thought of before . \npseudo- substance - hollywood faking deep meanings in their films . \nhave you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed , then when you look back , you realize there was something missing ? \nmore and more , filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed , melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being a great film , but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience , you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff . \ni'm not trying to say city of angels is that bad . \nit had a lot going for it , but somewhere along the way , it faltered . \nsomehow , underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all , there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography . \nthe predictable ending that shattered our hopes ( even though we saw it coming ) only added to the disappointment . \nbut for over an hour , city of angels is well worth the time . \nnicolas cage is seth , a guardian angel who , like hundreds ( likely thousands or even millions ) of other angels , spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality ; humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life . \nmeg ryan , in her most subdued performance yet , plays maggie , a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is we're fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive . \nafter losing a patient on the surgery table , these questions envelope maggie , and seth , the angel who was there to oversee the patient's transition into the afterlife , is immediately captivated by the doctor . \nhe begins following and observing maggie , falling more and more in love with her everyday . \nangels , who we quickly learn are not and never were humans , can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch , but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire . \nseth's adoration is too much to resist , and eventually he does appear to maggie , quite regularly , although such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community . \nthe angels are interestingly presented , all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities , but it's a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness . \ncage is a wonderfully versatile actor ( think face/off , raising arizona , and it could happen to you - what a combo ! ) who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once . \nit's nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire . \nthe two aren't very comparable to each other , but they both deviate from her usual \" intelligently ditzy \" romantic comedy roles , and it's an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy . \nbut even though the two leads do an impressive job , it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of a hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye . \nit's a shame that with so much going for it , city of angels falters so much in its final stages , leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there , they just didn't know quite how to get to it . \nthey struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high . \nfilmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on , remember , and convey to others thru word of mouth , so after telling us for 60+ minutes that this film is a glorious masterpiece , they sure leave us with a disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths . \nbased on the german film wings of desire ( that being the english title , of course ) , city of angels is ninety percent success , enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings , even the devastatingly disappointing ending . \nmost movie goers , the non-cynics anyway , will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which needs to be criticized . \nnonetheless , city of angels is beautifully captivating , which is probably enough to satisfy those poetic viewers who will appreciate a delve into rich emotional territories . \n", "synopsis : bobby garfield ( yelchin ) lives in a small town with his mirthless widowed mother ( hope davis ) . \nbobby's world revolves around his friends , especially the spritely carol ( boorem ) . \nthen one day , a new boarder arrives at bobby's house . \nted brautigan ( hopkins ) is an enigmatic man to whom bobby takes an immediate liking . \nas the bond between bobby and ted deepens , bobby becomes privy to ted's great secret , an event which will change both of their lives forever . \nreview : a small but enchanting movie , \" hearts in atlantis \" easily recalls another king-inspired coming-of-age film , \" stand by me \" , both in terms of its setting and the sentiment it conveys . \n \" hearts \" is a tribute to the magic of childhood , to those summers when the days seem neverending , and nothing means more than your closest friends . \nunlike \" stand by me \" , there is a supernatural element to \" hearts \" , but although it is key to the plot , it is not prominent . \nlike \" stand by me \" , this is a mostly character-driven film , and as such it benefits greatly from superb casting . \nyelchin is very good as bobby , finding a good mix of innocence and resignation . \nmore splendid still is boorem , whom i praised highly for her work in \" along came a spider \" and who is simply radiant here as carol . \nand then there is hopkins , who despite playing such a quiet , introspective character as ted , nonetheless commands our attention every time he is onscreen . \nless successful is davis , whose strident elizabeth comes across as overly cartoonish . \ni also found it odd that bobby and carol's other friend , sully ( whose death as an adult sets up the movie's flashback framing device ) , is paid virtually no attention . \nbut hicks' direction is lovely without being cloying , and despite the movie's general lack of incident , it never ceases to weave its spell over the audience . \n", "synopsis : in this movie , steven spielberg , one of today's finest directors , attempts to spice up the 1800s story of a long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque ( djimon hounsou ) - - a young angry man from sierra leone who was kidnapped into slavery - - and his fellow prisoners . \ncinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders , but since the americans don't speak cinque's language , the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slaves . \ntechnically , since the international slave trade was outlawed at that time , people like cinque couldn't be kidnapped into slavery ; one had to be born a slave to be legally considered a slave . \nlawyers baldwin and adams ( matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins ) must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery , rather than born slaves , in order to get them out of prison as free men . \nthree lengthy court cases are portrayed with spielberg's trademark panache - - flashy beginning , lots of facial close-ups , big music , and dramatic imagery . \na final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened to the various characters . \nopinion : making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life . \nin fiction , one invents purposeful , clear-cut good guys and bad guys , puts the fictional characters in conflict , and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion . \nreal life , however , consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around , think thoughts and do nothing , or come and go before events are resolved . \nspielberg gives us a visually spicy and historically accurate real life story . \ndjimon hounsou and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performances . \n", "the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do . \nlives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment's notice . \nthe negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower . \nmost of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants . \nit takes a pretty smart person to do that . \nbut what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ? \nwhat if he's also able to think on his feet ? \nin fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ? \nit is this circumstance which forms the basis for f . gary gray's the negotiator . \nin this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l . jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force . \nwhen his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman's home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder . \nfaced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain's office . \ni don't quite remember if the captain actually said , \" i hate to do this , but . . . \" , \nalthough it wouldn't surprise me if he did . \nluckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above . \nafter being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j . t . \nwalsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed . \nalthough roman's actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue . \njackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman . \nthe actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats . \nthe script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence . \nhow can we believe he's going to shoot a hostage , no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ? \nunfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it's would-be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson's acting ability . \nalmost every time he's in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back . \nwhen spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course . \nhis is an interesting character . \nmade out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation . \n \" i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can't talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , \" he says . \nwhen he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be . \nsoon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail . \nthis complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor . \nas the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely . \ngray really lucked out with this cast . \ndavid morse as commander beck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey . \nthe only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d . a . \nin l . a . confidential , and spencer played a police detective in cop land . \nwith the level of acting , however , this can be forgiven . \nalso in the supporting cast , paul giamatti as rudy , one of the hostages , is notable for the comic relief he provides . \nhis character is initially so slimy , and giamatti himself just looks so shifty , that you expect to laugh before he even says anything . \nfortunately , this doesn't distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film , but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout . \nj . t . walsh , as the suspicious internal affairs inspector , clocks in with one of his final performances . \nsadly , the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year , and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film . \nwalsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam , backdraft , and nixon . \nfor one of his best performances , check out sling blade , in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton . \nwhen jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march , walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success ( the actors performed together in a few good men ) . \nthe negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh , and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role , it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing . \nin the end , the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it's reality . \nwe're served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best . \nas an audience , we're also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie , and we'd like to see if one will dominate the film . \nboth provide some pretty good entertainment . \n", "plot : a young man who loves heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon , to whom he's devoted a tribute band in which he sings , gets launched into stardom when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his place . \ncritique : i'm a sucker for movies like this . \na young man with a humble background and lofty dreams , works hard , devotes the time , the energy and the patience , and ultimately hits it big-time . \nin the case of this film , our boy loves a certain heavy metal band and as luck would have it ( yup , luck always finds its way into these types of equations , although generally tied very closely to hard work ) , they need a new singer . \nhis entry and adaptation to the whole \" rock 'n roll \" lifestyle fills the rest of the film and is really fun to watch . \nalthough i will preface this by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love ( or past love ) of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it . \nmetal was one of my first loves as a teen and even though the genre of music isn't that prominent anymore , i still check out my motley crue , twisted sister and anthrax cds every now and again . \nthat's not to say that you won't like this film if you don't like the music , but the music and live performances from the band , play a big part in the movie , and i for one , had a blast watching and listening to it all . \nbut the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by mark wahlberg . \nwow , hand this fella some major props , as he totally becomes this heavy metal geek/god ( incidentally , metal god was the film's original title , and a much better one if you ask me ) . \nhe is this movie and i was quite taken by his character pretty much the whole way through . \nhe came off like a regular guy with extremely passionate goals and work ethic , who was willing to do anything in order to fulfill his dreams . \naniston was also surprisingly good as the girlfriend ( and the romance angle between them was sweet ) , but she didn't pull me in hard enough during their emotional scenes . \ni was also impressed by some of the \" real \" musicians who played in the film ( zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne , jeff pilson from dokken , stephan jenkins from third eye blind , blas elias from slaughter ) , but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band members . \nit's to note that this film was based on a real-life tale of a young man who used to sing in a judas priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer ( their original singer also admitted to being gay , as in this film ) . \njust for the record , i'm certainly not recommending this film for its originality or surprise elements , since most of this stuff has already been covered in some way or another in other movies , but because it's a fun , uplifting , well-paced movie with a solid central showing by wahlberg and energetic live performances . \noh yeah , and for those who dig the \" heavier \" side of music , the soundtrack also rocks ! ! \nyou see . . . dreams \ncan come true . . . \nwhere's joblo coming from ? \nalmost famous ( 8/10 ) - blow ( 8/10 ) - boogie nights ( 9/10 ) - detroit rock city ( 8/10 ) - girlfight ( 6/10 ) - goodfellas ( 10/10 ) \n", "carry on matron is the last great carry-on film in my opinion . \nmade in 1972 , it still features most of the regulars of this genre . \nsid james plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit , kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting , head of the hospital but also a hypochondriac , hattie jacques re-takes her role as matron , and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr . goode . \nthe jokes come in fast and so do the laughs , with humorous antics between the matron and sir bernard . \nthis time , williams is after matron ( jacques ) when he needs to prove himself that he is a man after visiting dr . goode . \nthe doctor ( hawtrey ) is sworn to secrecy : - \" i assure you , that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other ! \" \nbernard thinks he is having a sex change and needs to prove himself . \nthere are great cameos from joan sims , an expectant mother who is many weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene , and from kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks he's at work ( at the railway station ) . \nsid james' gang including cyril his son ( kenneth cope ) try to find out where the pills are by getting cyril to dress up as a nurse and live in at the nurses home . \nhe has to share a room with nurse ball ( barbara windsor ) and she soon sees through him ! \nthe film ends with the attempted robbery of the hospital's pills with panic ensuing . \nthere are good performances by hattie jacques as the matron , however her character seems a little more subdued and quieter than her previous 'matron's' . \nwilliams is , as usual , on top form , but sid james isn't given a very good part in this movie and i would forgive anyone to forget that he was in the movie at all . \nthe same does not go for charles hawtrey , for although he only first appears in the movie after 30 minutes gone and has scarce screen time , he seems to steal every scene he is in . \nby not making use of sid james and barbara windsor's talent to full effect , the film seems to flounder , but it certainly makes up for it with it's good storyline and it's other appealing characters . \nthis film is genuinely funny and i could watch it again and again and not get bored ! \n", "the ultimate match up between good and evil , \" the untouchables \" is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry . \nbased on the 1959 television show of the same title , \" the untouchables \" may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script . \nthe film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public . \nelliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order . \nhowever , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws . \nthe fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes . \nthe film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws . \nthe film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone's men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl . \nfrom this point we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard . \nright from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs . \nthis developed hatred is before the film's hero , ness , is even introduced . \ni found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone . \nthe film only gets better from this point . \nwith the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats . \nthey walk in unison and they only look forward . \nas they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens . \nholding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films . \none that comes to mind is \" the matrix \" when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world . \nwearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930's style , the similarities between these two are countless . \n \" the untouchables \" has some of the hippest , bravest heroes in any action film . \nthe four members were the only ones willing to go against capone's army . \neach member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others . \nelliot ness , played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner , is a character that surely grows during the course of the film . \nhe begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be . \nhowever , as the film develops so does ness . \nhis beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side . \nhe also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends . \nhis anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in . \nsean connery , who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role , plays malone , an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables . \nmalone acts as a mentor to ness . \nhe teaches him \" the chicago way \" to do things ; when they attack with a knife , you attack with a gun . \nconnery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed . \nandy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone , a young man who is just becoming a police officer . \nas ness grows , he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him . \ncharles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone . \nsmith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film . \nthe action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen . \nalso very similar to \" the matrix , \" they are exciting and intense . \n>from a western-like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps , the scenes are well thought out and well executed . \nthe score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement . \nits pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors . \nthe combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective . \nalthough the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified , this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting , great directing , and great action . \nsome scenes ( capone and the baseball bat , the train station ) have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid . \n", "having not seen , \" who framed roger rabbit \" in over 10 years , and not remembering much besides that i liked it then , i decided to rent it recently . \nwatching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is . \naside from the fact that it's a milestone in animation in movies ( it's the first film to combine real actors and cartoon characters , have them interact , and make it convincingly real ) and a great entertainment it's also quite an effective comedy/mystery . \nwhile the plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original , especially baby herman , and watching them together is a lot of fun . \nthe story begins in hollywood in 1947 . \ncartoon star roger rabbit is blowing takes and having trouble keeping his mind on work , so hard-boiled private detective eddie valiant ( bob hoskins ) is called in by studio head r . k . \nmaroon ( alan tilvern ) to try to help get roger's mind back on work . \nmaroon thinks that roger's wife , jessica's , possible unfaithfulness to him might be the cause of distraction and tells eddie to get some photos of her in the act before it costs him any more money in reshoots . \nvaliant takes some photos of jessica playing , `patty cake' with marvin acme ( stubby kaye ) , the owner of toontown ( where all of the cartoon characters live ) and takes them to maroon . \nupon seeing them , roger is emotionally destroyed and soon after acme is found dead and roger rabbit is the prime suspect . \nthe rest of the movie follows valiant and roger as they run around town ( and eventually toontown ) trying to clear roger's good name . \nalong the way they meet judge doom ( christopher lloyd ) a judge-jury-and executioner type who's out to get roger and has discovered the one and only way to kill a `toon . ' \n`who framed roger rabbit' won 4 academy awards including a special achievement award for richard williams for animation direction and creation of the cartoon characters ( williams and his teams went through the film frame by frame and hand drew the cartoon characters in ) . \ndirector robert zemekis must be given an equal amount of praise for overseeing the entire production , which included hundreds of animators . \nalso bob hoskins' performance should be credited . \nhe , in addition to the rest of the human cast , finds the right note to play in all of the scenes with his cartoon co-stars . \naccording to the internet movie database , hoskins studied his young daughter to learn how to act with imaginary characters and i guess his hard work paid off . \n`who framed roger rabbit' is a rare film . \none that not only presented a great challenge to the filmmakers but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family ( although some very young viewers may be a little scared by judge doom ) . \ndo yourself a favor and rent it , `p-p-p-p-please . \" \n", "there's something about ben stiller that makes him a popular choice among casting directors these days . \nstiller currently has three projects in circulation , and what other actor can lay claim to that ? \nhe's in \" there's something about mary , \" which i * still * haven't seen . \nand he's in the acerbic \" your friends & neighbors , \" playing a talkative , sexually-frustrated drama coach called jerri . \nnow there's \" permanent midnight , \" in which stiller plays another jerry , this one a heroin-addicted television writer , last name stahl . \nthere's also something about this industry that pushes bankable stars like stiller into doing drug-addiction pictures the minute they've proved themselves commercially . \newan mcgregor springs to mind who , after successful turns in \" emma \" and \" brassed off , \" received greater respect and admiration for his mind-blowing realization as renton in danny boyle's transatlantic junk-fest , \" trainspotting . \" \nthe philosophy appears to be a simple one : if you want 'em to be taken seriously , make 'em do drugs . \n \" permanent midnight \" is based on the true life experiences of jerry stahl , a successful hollywood writer who , in the mid-eighties , had a $5 , 000-a-week job churning out plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms and a $6 , 000-a-week heroin habit . \na habit , in stahl's own words , \" the size of utah . \" \nas stahl , stiller contributes a commanding performance . \nunlike \" trainspotting , \" which was successful in having it both ways by chronicling both the highs and the lows of heroin abuse , \" permanent midnight \" instead focuses on the concept of drug addiction as maintenance . \none of the earliest observations in the film is a casual reference to \" naked lunch \" author william s . burroughs who , when asked why he shoots up first thing in the morning responds , \" so i can shave . \" \nstahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill of it all in \" permanent midnight \" ; it's so he can talk to his mother on the phone , show up for work on time , even pay his bills . \nwhile the film itself occasionally wobbles around along with stahl , the writing ( adapted from stahl's autobiography by director david veloz ) is controlled and pointed . \n \" permanent midnight \" shows how stahl moved from new york to l . a . to--again in the author's words-- \" escape the drug scene \" ( yeah , right ) ; why he entered into a convenient marriage with a british tv exec ( elizabeth hurley , so impossibly polite you'd swear her single profanity was dubbed ) ; and that he conceived a child in between his random hirings and firings . \nstahl narrates all this in a motel bedroom to a sympathetic lover called kitty ( norristown's own maria bello ) with whom he spent some rehab time . \njaneane garofalo is wasted--and miscast--as a heavily-bespectacled hollywood talent agent who fails to get her hooks into the doped-up wordsmith , and that's stahl himself playing a jaded clinic counselor . \nstiller , unshaven ( burroughs take note ) and with lots of mascara around the eyes , has stahl stumble through the film looking like a train wreck but , to his credit , never once pushes his pill-popping , needle-jabbing performance over the top . \nthe ubiquitous stiller is the reason to see \" permanent midnight \" ; a dark , comic , and strangely absorbing study of assisted living . \n", "by phil curtolo mel gibson ( braveheart ) gave a gripping performance as the father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howard's ransom . \ngibson plays tom mullen , a wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as a deranged psychopath , played by gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , and his band of low-life thugs kidnap his only son for $2 million . \ntom and his wife , kate , played by rene russo ( tin cup ) were instructed not to inform the police , but they contacted the fbi . \nminutes later , an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo ( broken arrow ) are in tom's house and wiring every phone . \nthe plot sounds average , just like most other kidnap movies that you've already seen , and it was nothing more than that . \nthat is until about half-way through the movie . \nsuddenly , tom goes to the fox 5 news room and makes a live broadcast saying , \" this is your ransom . \nbut this is as close as you will ever get to it . \ninstead , i am offering this money as a reward on your head , dead or alive . \" \nat this point , the plot thickened , and the unusually slow start of the film turned into a suspense-filled action film with great stunts . \nthe last half of the film is very well done . \nanother thing that carries this film are the superb performances by gibson and sinise , as they collide in a game of wits over their cellular phones for most of the movie . \nowen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject : \" it makes you wonder what kidnappers did before cell phones . \" \nbefore this movie , sinise played mostly \" good guys , \" first in of mice & men , then in forrest gump , and most recently , in apollo 13 . \nbut he was surprisingly devilish and cold in his portrayal of a cop-gone-bad . \ngibson , of course , was just being gibson , in an oscar-worthy performance . \nalthough most of the scenes were quite predictable , ransom is a very entertaining and suspenseful film . \n , \n", "one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction . \nthe purpose of star trek is to provide flashy , innocent fun . \nsometimes the stories are compelling . \nsometimes they're not . \nbut , with the exception of the first film in the series ( which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces ) , i've never been bored by any of the enterprise's numerous missions . \nstar trek : insurrection is no exception . \nthe film has gotten some negative reviews ( a friend of mine actually thinks it's the worst in the series ) , but i'm not really sure why . \nit's an exciting , often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film . \nsome say it's a bit too light , and more of a long episode than a film . \nothers say the special effects are cheesy and that it's boring . \ni simply enjoyed the film . \ninsurrection , which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast , introduces us to a race of people called the ba'ku ; the ba'ku are very old ( most of them are about three hundred years old ) , but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet . \nof course , these peaceful people can't horde this fountain of youth all for themselves ? leave it up to their archenemies , the son'a , led by ru'afo ( f . \nmurray abraham ) , to mess everything up . \nthe son'a , who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable , strike a deal with the federation to move the ba'ku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying . \nthat's when captain picard ( patrick stewart ) steps in : he realizes that moving the ba'ku would kill them ( it also helps that he falls in love with a ba'ku woman ( donna murphy ) ) . \nso , with his trusty crew , picard defies the federation to keep the ba'ku in their natural habitat . \nwhen dealing with a series with as much history as this , it's not entirely necessary to re-introduce your characters with each episode . \nthis is why i believe non-fans have a hard time getting into star trek ; in order to enjoy it , one has to understand how to approach it . \ninsurrection , however , does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters . \nstewart is bold as always , a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together . \njonathan frakes , who also directed , is funny as commander riker ; a subplot with data ( brent spiner ) discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting ; and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain , overacting like crazy . \nfrakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact ; insurrection is an exciting film , with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action . \nthis is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation , and the result is very pleasing to the eye : particularly in the climactic scenes , in which the son'a employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the ba'ku planet , the special effects have a clean , impressively sharp look . \nif i have any complaint about the film , it's that it tries to take a moral stance when it's not very appropriate to do so . \ni don't think it's that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move 600 ba'ku in order to save the lives of thousands . \nbetter yet , why couldn't they have co-existed ? \ninsurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience . \nwith it's inherent camp factor , the star trek series doesn't seem well-equipped to deal with issues like this . \ni prefer to just enjoy the spectacle . \n", "a fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july ! \n>from ace ventura to truman burbank , jim carrey has run the whole gamut of comic , yet sympathetic , characters . \n1996's the cable guy was supposed to be his big \" breakthrough \" role from zany humor into darker , more dramatic acting . \nas most everyone knows , the results were , well , less-than-stellar . \nnot only did the film not do so hot at the box office , but it was also panned by critics . \nas far as i know , gene siskel and i are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it . \nthe first time i saw the cable guy , in theatres , i was in super critic-mode , and didn't really like it . \nhowever , due to the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day , i've had time to lean back , relax , and take in the film . \nand to my surprise , it grew on me . \nthe plot is rather simple : broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy , played by carrey , then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship . \nsee , steven's been having some problems with his girlfriend , robin ( leslie mann ) , and he doesn't think he has any more room in his life for a new friend . \nalso , some of the cable guy's antics have been creeping him out . \ncarrey , as the cable guy , gives steven various aliases , which later we find out are all tv characters : larry tate , chip douglas , ricky ricardo , etc . he apparently lives in his cable van , and while many critics didn't enjoy this newer , darker , less-manic performance from carrey , i thought it was interesting and rather well-done . \nfor me , its not the movie as a whole that's enjoyable , but rather several individual scenes : a karaoke jam at steven's apartment , a medieval fight at a theme restaurant , and a bathroom beating ( a la liar , liar ) , just to name a few . \nperhaps the fact that more of carrey's humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny . \nand if you really want to see something , you've got to hear his version of jefferson airplane's \" somebody to love \" , sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam . \nthe cable guy has its bad spots , like most any movie . \ni didn't particularly like steven's girlfriend , and i felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend . \nalso , the ending , while having you fooled for a moment , is rather contrived , and somewhat dissapointing . \nstill , i found the cable guy to be a worthwhile venture ; if you're at the video store and can't think of anything to rent , i suggest you try it out . \nor if you have hbo , just wait till it comes on ( you won't have to wait long . ) \nhell , that's what i do every day . \n", "when bulworth ended , i allowed myself a sigh of relief : ? it is possible for me to enjoy political satire . ? \nthere have been several recent political films that didn't do a whole lot for me -- wag the dog , for instance , i found to be an intelligent but heartless film , while primary colors is unbearable and unwatchable in its awfulness . ? \nbulworth is a far better film than these , both in its execution and lasting impression . ? \nit's a tremendously funny and intelligent picture , but it also has an emotional center -- writer/director/star warren beatty allows the audience to identify with his character , and , in turn , we like him and actually care about the story . \n ? \nbeatty plays incumbent democratic senator jay billington bulworth ; the film opens and we see bulworth sobbing as he watches his television spots over and over again . ? \nhe hasn't slept in days , nor has he eaten , and , almost instantaneously , he goes insane . \n ? he's not stark raving mad ( not outright , anyway ) , but he's definitely bonkers . \n ? it's the final weekend of his campaign , and his assistant , murphy ( oliver platt ) has written him a speech to feed to a group of black people in a church in the ghetto . \n ? bulworth begins the speech , but suddenly goes off track and just starts being honest . ? \n \" you mean , \" one lady asks , \" the democratic party doesn't care about the african american community ? \" ? \n \" well , \" he shouts , laughing , \" isn't that obvious ? \" \nthe story is propelled by a device in which bulworth puts out a contract on his own life ( he muses later that it's a bad thing to make decisions when you're suicidal ) ; he keeps seeing a man in sunglasses ( graham beckel ) whom he believes to be the hitman . \n ? bulworth also meets nina ( halle berry ) with whom he becomes infatuated . \n ? suddenly , in the short span of this weekend , bulworth's no-nonsense \" truth in politics \" methods become a national sensation , and he shoots ahead in the polls despite the fact that he's appearing on television wearing gang clothes and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences . \nbeatty's work on both sides of the camera is excellent . ? \nhis script and direction are both extremely sharp , as is the surprisingly strong characterization of bulworth himself . ? \nhere is a man who's reached his limit , and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political structure . ? \ni like that the film doesn't take a clear shot at any of the political parties or affiliations , but at politics in general and how everything is run by the rich ( although the anti-rich sentiments do get a bit tiresome by the end of the film ) . ? \nsome of the segments are simply hilarious , such as a lengthy rap that he delivers at a luncheon dedicated to him . ? \nmuch of the film is completely absurd , but that's the fun part about it . ? \nit's an angry , serious film at the core , but the package that beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in the genre . ? \nwhat adds to this feeling is beatty's portrayal of bulworth ; this is a performance that deserves recognition on a higher scale . \n ? beatty is so much fun to watch here -- he's always funny , but he's also subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions . \n ? beatty is so good that bulworth , despite his shortcomings as a human being , is an entirely sympathetic and likable character almost from the beginning . \nthe supporting cast is vast and colorful . ? \nberry is luminous , as always , and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles . ? \ndon cheadle has a good role as a drug dealer who uses gun-toting toddlers to do his dirty work . ? \noliver platt is an actor who should be careful , for someday i fear he may induce a heart attack with the intensity of his acting ( though he's very funny to watch ) . ? paul sorvino adds the southern accent to his list of mastered inflections . \nis bulworth offensive ? ? \ni suppose some may see it that way . ? \ni wasn't offended by the film , but then again , i hardly care about politics . ? \ni think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of the story . ? \nthe film isn't perfect , of course -- the ending didn't quite work for me , and the a few of the scenes between bulworth and nina feel forced ( although the eclectic dance sequence is fantastic ) . ? \nbut these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant film . ? \nbulworth is a smart , uproariously funny picture that proves to me that political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface . ? \n", "call 911 for the cliche police if you must , but the eyes are the window to the soul . \nthe finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze : paul newman , ralph fiennes , anthony hopkins , morgan freeman . \nyou look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds , that the characters they play are real human beings . \nwe will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor , but he had that unique quality in his eyes . \nin gridlock'd , an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire , shakur and his co-star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry . \nshakur and roth play ezekiel \" spoon \" whitmore and alexander \" stretch \" rome , two detroit buddies who share a spoken word/jazz trio , an apartment and a drug addiction with cookie ( thandie newton ) . \nwhen a new year's eve party ends with cookie comatose after a drug overdose , spoon and stretch begin to wonder if they are living on borrowed time . \nthey soon make a new year's resolution to get into rehab , but that proves to be easier said than done . \nas though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough , spoon and stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting a road block of bureaucracy , confusion and red tape . \nthe government might be the least of their obstacles , however , as they find themselves suspects in the murder of a drug dealer , and on the run from a nasty thug ( vondie curtis hall ) . \nin order for you to buy into gridlock'd at all , you have to accept it as a surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism ; unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie , they are going to government offices on new year's day , in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all . \ngridlock'd may actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey , 1991's falling down , which found a besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during a trek through inner city los angeles . \nin falling down , michael douglas' d-fens ( the character's personalized license plate , echoed in gridlock'd by the drug lord d-reper's plates ) whips out a gun because he can't get breakfast at mcdonald's ; in gridlock'd , spoon and stretch are unarmed against the demands placed on them before they can get into a rehab center . \nand where the unhinged d-fens became a heroic surrogate for audiences , writer/director vondie curtis hall refuses to let spoon and stretch off the hook for their own part in the situation . \none bureaucrat responds to a tirade from stretch with the question , \" do you expect the world to stop . . . just \nbecause you picked _today_ to clean up ? \" \nthe world in gridlock'd is just as frustrating as the world in falling down , but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time . \nhall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system , but perhaps not enough of them . \na significant chunk of gridlock'd is devoted to spoon and stretch's flight from d-reper and from the police , and those sub-plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments . \nin one scene , stretch scares off d-reper by getting chummy with a police officer ; another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenly-suspected heroes in a public place watching a television news report of the crime which shows their pictures . \nthe entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running , while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time . \nhall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the film's main events , perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through self-destructive behavior . \noh , the irony of it . \ntupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case , and living the life to back it up . \nin gridlock'd , shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scares him . \nspoon is an idea for a character at best as written by hall , but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction . \nmostly it comes through those eyes , eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta . \nit is spoon who plays conscience to stretch's pure appetite , and roth plays stretch with a gleeful self-destructiveness ( he reveals that he is hiv positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again ) which is as much an obstacle to spoon's goal as any agency or enemy . \ngridlock'd's most cruelly comic scene finds stretch \" helping \" spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with a tiny pocket knife , and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keeps has slowly drained the life out of him . \nwith friends like that , spoon doesn't need enemies , and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of a man who has seen too much . \nthe tragedy now is that we won't get more chances to see those eyes again . \n", "hilarious , ultra-low budget comedy from film school dropout kevin smith chronicles a day in the life of two convenience store slackers ( brian o'halloran and jeff anderson ) . \nthey spend most of their day ignoring customers while discussing everything from fellatio to self-fulfillment . \nthe premise is strictly sitcom and the photography is grainy as all get-out , but you could spend ten times the film's budget ( a reported $27 , 000 ) and still not get dialogue half as good as this . \noriginally rated nc-17 for language . \nnot recommended for viewers with sensitive ears . \nkilling zoe =========== \nremake reservoir dogs as a french art film and you're halfway to killing zoe , writer/director roger avary's slow-moving story of a failed bastille day bank robbery . \neric stoltz stars as an american in paris who gets in * way * over his head when hooks up with a band of nihilistic bank robbers . \nhe's the safecracker who's blissful unaware that the bank job is a botch job from the word go . \nthough intriguing on all fronts , the film is paced at half the speed of pulp fiction , which avary co-wrote with quentin tarantino . \nin english and french . \nthe road to wellville ===================== \nbased on the novel by t . coraghessan boyle , the road to wellville doesn't go very far . \nbowels , bowels , and more bowels are explored by dr . john harvey kellogg ( a buck-toothed and bespectacled anthony hopkins ) , who , in the early 1900's , advocated abstinence , vegetarianism , and frequent defecation . \nhe also invented the cornflake . \nreally . \nchecking-in to kellogg's battle creek sanitarium are matthew broderick and bridget fonda , just two of the many well-known faces in this failed comedy . \nleave your laughter at the door and you can marvel at the unfunny antics of john cusack , michael lerner , lara flynn boyle , john neville , and dana carvey . \nthe art direction is impeccable and some of the early sequences are amusing , but the novelty quickly wears off as writer/director alan parkers tries his darnedness to turn doo-doo into drama . \nwhat he ends up with is something that i can't print here . \nphew ! \nstargate ======== \nlawrence of arabia meets star wars . \nthis epic sci-fi film is more sheer spectacle than anything else . \ndirector roland emmerich ( universal solider ) shamelessly rips off lucas and spielberg and just about any other cosmic cliche that he can lay his hands on . \nthe film is overlong , the characters are cardboard , and the script is filled with some of the most laughable details in modern sci-fi history . \nthat said , there's still plenty to watch here . \nsci-fi fans should enjoy the sculpted sands , the morphing headdresses , and a surprisingly spunky james spader . \nhe plays the egyptologist who gets to prove his theory that that \" somebody else \" built the pyramids . \nless interesting are co-stars kurt russell and jaye davidson of crying game fame . \nstar trek generations ===================== \ntrek fans may be more forgiving , but , for the rest of us , the sluggish star trek generations is a mixed bag at best . \nthe story is interesting , but each scene goes too long . \nthe cast is earnest , but the direction lacks punch . \nand so on . \n ( the best example of the latter is a klingon comeuppance that delivers none of the impact of a similar scene in star trek ii . ) \noriginal enterprise captain james t . kirk appears on both ends of the story , though they cut the scene where shatner turns to the screen to plead \" get a life . \" \nremarkably unremarkable . \nmiracle on 34th street ====================== \nin a season of the specialist and pulp fiction et al , maybe a remake of miracle on 34th street * is * necessary . \njohn hughes certainly believes in santa claus and his les mayfield-directed production does nothing to tarnish the memory of the 1947 original . \nthe romance between costars dylan mcdermott and elizabeth perkins doesn't work too well , but the film makes a strong case that richard attenborough is the definitive kriss kringle . \nhis chemistry with children can moisten any eye . \nno claus for alarm . \njunior ====== \narnold schwarzenegger pregnant ? \nsure , billy crystal did it before in rabbit test , but the sight of schwarz with a bulging belly is a casting coup comparable to dustin hoffman in tootsie . \nwhat should be nothing more than a one-joke premise actually gets better as it goes along . \ndirector ivan reitman ( dave , twins ) wisely keeps the farce to a minimum , so the first hour moves slower than you might expect . \ndon't expect too many yuks from danny devito , but you can't beat those early romantic scenes between emma and arnie . \nhow's * that * for a collision of acting styles ? \n", "for those of us who weren't yet born when the 1960's rock 'n' rolled around , monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies . \nfrom otis redding to jimi hendrix , janis joplin to the mamas and the papas , and jefferson airplane to the who , this documentary is jam-packed with contagious energy . \nbut i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending , which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves . \nshot in 1969 at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock , the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time . \nsure , some have painted their faces and smoke joints , but d . a . \npennebaker ( the war room , moon over broadway ) surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum of the audience . \nno matter who is watching , it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul . \nthe excitement starts before the music even begins . \na young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer , she replies that she feels lucky to do so . \nthere are moments of organized craziness as john phillips , leader of the mamas and the papas and one of the concert organizers , tries to get in touch with dionne warwick . \nand when one band is tuning up , a member remarks , \" finally , a decent sound system ! \" \nyou can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isn't about vanity , it's about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it , a two-way street . \nthis interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience . \nit's impossible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball and chain . \nand while the lyrics to \" wild thing \" may not be all that complicated , watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love . \neven if you don't recognize every band you see on stage , you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats . \nthe only drawback to the film is the ending , which unfortunately i must reveal . \nall the other bands , big names then and still today , got approximately 7 to 10 minutes of screen time . \nin contrast , the last band on camera , a wholly forgettable one , gets an entire 18 minutes of screen time . \nfor a film that's only 78 minutes long , that's too large of a chunk , especially when previous acts are much more stimulating . \nall in all , monterey pop is a precious , rare look at a time period that still holds sway over us . \nthe variety of music , as well as the beautifully shot performances , are easy to become immersed in . \nif there was ever any question as to why most of these bands were so popular , this is quickly dispelled . \nit's almost depressing to think that music this moving doesn't get made much anymore . \ninstead we're stuck with * nsync , the backstreet boys , and jennifer lopez , all of whom should have stuck with modeling . \n", "the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola's 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia , which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages . \nmartin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime . \nunfortunately for scorsese

film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime . \nthis film was goodfellas , epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s . \ngoodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story , told in best-seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi ( who would co-write the screenplay for the film ) . \nthe book , as well as the film , chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill ( played by ray liotta ) , irish-italian criminal from new york . \nat the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero ( played by paul sorvino ) , local mob boss , and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands . \nafter couple of years , together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito ( played by joe pesci ) , he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway ( played by robert de niro ) . \nthree of them spend years as best friends and associates , gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history . \nwealth , influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen ( played by lorraine bracco ) , who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities , domestic abuse , arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business . \nbut the perfect world of \" wiseguys \" gradually begins to fall apart - tommy's unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence , jimmy's reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and , finally , henry's own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends . \ngoodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory . \nscorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker . \nworld depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating . \nscorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence , hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime , yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny . \nafter being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history ( based on some notorious real life events ) , the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths , trading the superficial and short-lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens . \nscorsese also manages to break viewer's moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal tragedies , broken homes , human depravity , violence , bloodshed and murder - in all their uncompromising reality , but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience . \nwith the use of ironic soundtrack , manipulative shots , character's dialogue or narrator's commentary , goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era . \neven if we don't pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining , we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker . \nfirst , we might notice unusual structure of the plot - relatively minor subplot is used as movie's ironic prologue . \nthen , instead of single narrator , scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards . \nthis multiple points of views , both in terms of narration and various subjective shots , only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation . \nsame ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack . \nnostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy-listening 1950s pop songs , while depression , paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s . \nbut the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment - almost pastoral , easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed . \nhowever , thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people . \nsuch scenes , although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings , became very popular among other directors in 1990s . \nfragmentary character of the screenplay , which doesn't have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes , gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese . \nhe uses this structure of film to experiment , and most successful of such experiments is hilarious \" a day in life \" segment near the end of the film . \nanother essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents . \nthe most respectable among them is robert de niro , but his character , who happen to be most quiet and business-like member of criminal trio , gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues . \njoe pesci deserved his \" oscar \" for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy , and his lines , including ad-libs , probably represent the most memorable element of the film . \nray liotta , although equally talented , perhaps doesn't look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film . \nliotta's henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low-level street thugs . \nliotta , on the other hand , improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction . \nlorraine bracco is , on the other hand , very effective and believable as karen hill , wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband . \npaul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso , and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small-time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave . \nas a combination of clever sociological study , black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do - work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time . \nbecause of this achievement , and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers , this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s . \n", " \" the blair witch project \" was perhaps one of a kind , a unique film that played completely on its own merit , managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses . \nits success made a sequel inevitable , but this is not the sequel , i suspect , anyone much wanted . \nafter the release of \" the blair witch project \" , tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville , in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch . \nlocals have turned this mass hysteria into a great business opportunity , selling twig-sculptures , stones and dirt like those in the movie , and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn , shouting , \" get out of these woods and go home ! \nthere is no goddamned blair witch ! \" . \njeff ( ) is one of those people , who has used the sudden popularity of the small town to his advantage . \nafter he got released from the mental institution , he created a mobile business that attracts thousands of customers through the internet . \nas the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods , on the \" blair witch hunt \" . \namong the five strangers is stephen and his girlfriend , the pregnant tristen , who are writing a book on the hysteria caused by the film called \" the blair witch : history or hysteria ? \" , and kim , who dresses in black and has some psychic powers . \nthe last member of the crew is erica , a young beautiful witch-wannabe , who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore , saying \" the first rule of wicca is , do no harm , because whatever you do will come back to you threefold . \" \nthis strange group plunges into the woods , where they begin to argue about their different approaches to the experience . \non the very first night that they decide to spend under the stars amidst the ruins of parr's abandoned house , strange things start happening . \nwhen they wake up their equipment is gone and only the tapes remain . \nafter a while they discover strange markings on their bodies . \nthey are somehow lost in time , as it loops uncontrollably back and forth . \nthey are all haunted by hallucinations and horrible nightmares and soon they can not see the difference between dreams and reality . \nthe only thing that they are sure of is that they have brought something or someone with them from the woods . . \ndocumentary director joe berlinger ( \" paradice lost \" ) helms \" blair witch 2 \" , leaving the creators of the first film ( dan myrick and ed sanches ) in the background . \nthe opening scenes--the documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film-- is a more promising approach , because instead of trying to cover similar ground , it goes outside the first film and makes its own stand . \nbut soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked by its own story , that is never resolved and ends with a very anticlimaxic epilogue . \nin a way , this is a typical hollywood sequel . \nmore money has been spent and more people have worked on a project that was doomed to fail . \nthe horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated . \nof course in these situations , quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical values . \nfrom its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloody-red forest , with carter burwell's ( \" being john malkovich \" and \" fargo \" ) musical score in the background , you realize that with the exception of its title , this film has absolutely nothing to do with \" the blair witch project \" . \n \" blair witch . . \" \nwas filmed by handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting that was mostly based on improvisation . \nin the sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection , creating a completely different atmosphere . \nwith its graceful cinematography , production design and flashy editing , the film has a very polished look , which is impossible to associate with the first installment . \nand though berlinger directs his film with an energy and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body a couple of times , he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor . \nthe key is simplicity . \n \" blair witch project \" had a story which was incredibly simple . \nthat allowed the audience to fill the gaps with our own imagination . \nthe film was practically an empty screen , on which we projected our most frightening nightmares . \nthe effect was incredibly powerful , lasting and entir e everyone , but in a different way . \n \" book of shadows \" feels incredibly controlled and restrict . \nhere , very little is left to our imagination and the story is so complex and \" clever \" that the screenwriters are the first to get lost in it . \nthere is is no book of shadows and no conclusion that we can be satisfied with . \nthis is simply a less artistic film that doesn't have the talent and originality of its predecessor . \nit resorts to fancy cinematography and special effects to create the right effect and doesn't always succeed . \nbut most importantly : it stands on its own ground and has almost no connection with the first movie , which doesn't allow it to destroy the original . \nin the end , i can't call it a bad effort . \nit's less artistic , not so scary and less original , but certainly not bad . \nit's simply different . \nin fact , if you haven't seen \" the blair witch project \" , you might like this film for what it is -- a cross between \" the blair witch project \" and the \" scream \" -films . \nthe only element that remains constant and similar between the two films is the solid acting ( jeffrey donovan and tristine skyler should be mentioned ) and incredible sense of surrealism . \nbut it's a common knowledge and experience that , with a few exceptions , every movie sequel is worse than the original and some are even not worth making . \nto me the story of \" the blair witch project \" seemed completed , but there are obviously no limits to commercial success that \" the book of shadows \" is certainly assured . \nand it's already time to look forward to \" blair witch 3 \" . \n", "seen may 31 , 1999 on home video ( rented ) . \none of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own , everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise . \nwith some films it might be just a secondary issue , but with `dark city' what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are , which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully-constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie . \nthere's an old role-playing computer game called `d ? ja v ? ' wherein the player takes on the role of a man who can't remember who he is , where he is and how he got there . \nthe goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict . \nthe premise to this film is not unlike that game , only this time we don't have control over the protagonist . \nwe begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city ( actually , it's more than just the city , it's the whole reality ) that isn't just that neo-gothic look ( a la `batman , ' `blade runner , ' ) , but is so fully developed it's almost a different genre completely . \nlater he will learn that his name is john murdoch ( sewell ) , but for now he has no idea what's going on other than the fact something is not right . \nthe fact there's a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious , hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling . \nthis opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre , horrific tone . \nthe man doesn't know who he is nor where he's going and it's interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him . \nin fact , this is the way all stories begin since it's impossible to know the history of a character , their feelings , values , morals , etc . until after we've observed them for a while . \nbut in this case , the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization , developing the mood and outlining the story . \neventually , some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police . \nwe met inspector frank bumstead ( hurt ) , a quiet , unemotional , soft-spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time . \ntwo other important characters are also introduced : dr . daniel p . schreber ( sutherland ) , a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john's doctor ; and emma murdoch ( connelly ) , a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film-noir movies . \nit was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film . \nhe also contacts emma , which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex , mysterious back story . \nbut absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in `dark city , ' which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo . \neverything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance - considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot , its lighting , art direction and overall production design , they don't seem to be able to afford any gratuities . \nhowever , that might also be what's keeping it from reaching its maximum potential . \nby continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place , so much unlike the real world we know , we come to realize that it's all a hoax . \neveryone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction . \nbut , as the film's tagline says , `last night , one of us went off . ' \nfor reasons that are never clearly explained , it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive ( a process known as `tuning' ) . \nthe aliens , which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin , also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight . \nat the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made , they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then . \nthis premise certainly is interesting and director and co-screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard . \nhe does provide some explanations such as that dr . schreber is an assistant to `the strangers' because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form . \nthe aliens mix and match the memories of the city's population to see who will change and who will not . \nin the process this creates for a good deal of deep , thought-provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world . \nhowever , where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is . \nthe main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened , yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant , static and cold ( mediocre performances by hurt and connelly don't help either ) . \nfor example , john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her , yet in some scenes crucial to the film's plot , we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other , which is also part of the film's climax and ending . \nand that's what proyas seems to be inferring with the film , but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense . \nironically , this is what made his first film `the crow' work so well , which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical , dark twisted world . \nwith `dark city' the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message . \nstill , the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable . \nthere's a lot to like here , most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does . \nthe story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years . \n`dark city' is what the movies are all about - the escape from the real world . \n", "linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction , and her being cast as dogma's lead is nothing short of inexplicable . \nshe's still in fine form as bethany , an abortion clinic worker who's lost her faith . \none night , a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethany's bedroom . \nhe is metatron ( alan rickman ) , the voice of god , and he needs her help : she must stop two fallen angels from entering a new jersey church-the fate of the universe depends on it . \ngod would do it him/herself , but he/she is . . . missing , having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again . \nbethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the \" prophets \" jay ( jason mewes ) and silent bob ( kevin smith , doing double-duty ) , the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smith's films thus far . \nat some point , rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus , the undocumented ( and very black ) \" thirteenth apostle \" , and offers his assistance , as does divine stripper serendipity ( salma hayek ) . \nit's a wild ride . \nthey're in pursuit of loki and bartleby ( damon and affleck , respectively-this is probably the sharpest either has ever been ) , who were banished from heaven to wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic loophole that will enable their return . \nloki decides to wreak havoc along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates . \nat one point , he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words and bullets . \nit's a nasty , guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks , \" how corrupt are you ? \" . \nwings of desire this ain't . \nsince debuting with clerks , smith has grown as a director , particularly in terms of working with actors . \n ( chris rock is this film's only weak link-between jokes , he's wooden . ) \nhis no-frills visual style hasn't changed much over the years , though ( dogma's widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations ) , nor has his writing-his characters still sit around delivering one caustic , hilarious speech after another . \ndogma chips away at big religious issues-namely , the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefs-eloquently and articulately , but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition . \nas well , the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever . \nany movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum ( hurlyburly , anyone ? ) , and eventually dogma's pacing goes slack . \na long diatribe from bartleby late in the game , in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings , comes at a point when we've heard enough . \nbecause his change of heart ( bartleby is initially the good cop to loki's bad ) drives the climax , said rant is given a great deal of screen time . \nsure , affleck deserved a big moment ( damon steals their scenes together prior ) , but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated . \nlike tarantino , smith was a video-age sponge who became a sample-mad indie filmmaker . \ndogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies , including indiana jones and the last crusade , with silent bob doing his best harrison ford , and weird science-a shit demon attacks our heroes ! \nsmith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour : his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical ( a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan \" catholicism wow ! \" ) and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished . \ni bust ( ed ? ) a gut on several occasions . \nproceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever . \nit's a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease , for to read it , one actually has to see dogma . \nthe prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christ's , martin scorsese's 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis' controversial novel , in that it is not directly linked to the picture's content but to rumours and heresy . \nthere's a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime , just so they could know for certain what they were rallying against . \n ( not one of them had watched it . ) \nevery single person refused . \nsmith and scorsese have a lot in common , and so do the two films in question , because both smith's bethany and scorsese's jesus are hollow shells without their faith . \nin fact , dogma's denouement ( which follows a thrilling showdown that's worth the wait ) is a catholic love-in , a veritable recruitment poster . \n ( i felt sentimental about a religion i don't belong to . \nnow that's powerful filmmaking . ) smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god , and that spirituality shines through . \nit's enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins . \nmy religion is movies . \nwhen the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine , in a roundabout way they're attacking what i live for : freedom of expression through celluloid . \ni therefore feel that , although i'm no bible-thumper , i'm at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue and his followers . \n", "you've heard all the hype . \nyou've seen all their faces - natalie portman ( the professional ) as queen amidala , liam neeson ( schindler's list ) as qui-gon jinn , ewan mcgregor ( trainspotting ) as obi-wan kenobi , and jake lloyd ( jingle all the way ) as young anakin skywalker . \nif you've read any reviews , you've also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy . \nyou also may have heard that this one's too kiddie-friendly , and doesn't have enough content for adults . \nbelieve the hype . \nthe effects are stunning , the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic , the lightsaber duels are amazing , and queen amidala's sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth . \nbut there's something missing here , and it isn't budget or effects - it's everything money * can't * buy . \nthe actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad-stroked and flat characters . \nthe most successful at this is liam neeson who , as qui-gon jinn , a jedi master to young obi-wan kenobi , has quiet dignity and a wise , commanding presence . \nhe is the anchor to this movie , as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out . \nportman's queen amidala and mcgregor's obi-wan kenobi don't fare nearly so well . \namidala , the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation ( ? ! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life ) . \nand obi-wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he's nothing but a robin to qui-gon jinn's batman . \nhowever , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity , and he does a good job . \nhe also absolutely nails alec guiness' ( obi-wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise . \nin fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that's one of the problems with this film . \ni would never call myself a \" star wars \" fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i've always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america . \nhowever , if you are the one person in america who * hasn't * seen the films at all or even recently , or who doesn't bother to brush-up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost . \nfor example , one of the film's main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine . \nfor those of you not recently steeped in \" star wars \" trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader's master in \" return of the jedi \" and \" empire strikes back . \" \nso , obviously , his appearance in \" phantom menace \" is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful . \na lot of the movie is like that . \nr2-d2 and c-3po make token appearances , and it's obvious that lucas is banking on the audience's pre-existing fondness for them . . . \nbecause he doesn't do much to add to it in any way . \nsame goes for jabba the hutt , who doesn't look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy . \neven * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) , coruscant ( the cloud city from \" empire strikes back \" ) , and alderaan ( leia's home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in \" star wars \" ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing . \nwhat's the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ? \nthe answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty . \nthere's no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be . \nanother problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film . \ni was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters . \nand jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast . \nunlike chewbacca and c-3po , who got their humanity ( if you'll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive \" teenage mutant ninja turtles . \" \nfurthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot . \noddly , this isn't just * my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids . \nwell , he's done a good job . \nthe hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight-year-old boy . \nthat's not jake lloyd's fault , though - he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him . \nthat's another mistake , of course , because the cute tyke becomes darth vader . \nwarning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! ! \nin my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin's future evil in the film . \nthe boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks , and there's nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie . \nhe has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english- language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine . \nbut the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn't all hearts and roses is yoda's hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui-gon jinn . \nhis explanation ? \n \" his future is clouded . \" \n ( warning : major spoiler ahead . \nenter at your own risk . ) \nof course , the noble qui-gon dies at the hand of darth maul , a scary-looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts , but has turned to the dark side . \nthis dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie , but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double-sided lightsaber , and his scary facial makeup . \nbecause qui-gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force , obi-wan , qui-gon's young padawan apprentice ( one level below knightdom ) , must take over the training himself . \nso , at the end of the movie , we end where the saga actually begins - with obi-wan kenobi and his young apprentice , anakin \" darth vader \" skywalker . \ndid this story need to be told ? \ni would say no . \nbut is it a worthwhile movie to see ? \nabsolutely . \nif you don't enter the theater with jedi-size expectations , and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle , then this is your movie . \nthe tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation . \nthe digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight . \nand yoda and young obi-wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler , happier time . \nabove all , this is a fun movie . \nnot deep , not meaningful , and not profound . \nbut fun . \nmaybe next time , lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co-write the script , and the guy who directed \" empire \" will direct . \nbecause if lucas does the next one himself , it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most - potential . \n : ) \n", "as african american detective vergil tibbs questions a suspected white murderer inside a jail cell , there is a wonderful , eye-catching shot which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film . \nthe shot has tibbs' face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars . \nto see these bars blocking his face , we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film . \nas a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots , no matter how innocent tibbs is , he is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his skin . \nthe bars show that tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly who he is , instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous . \nthis one shot amazes me because it captures a whole theme in a matter of seconds . \nit perhaps may be the most powerful image i have seen in a film . \n \" in the heat of the night \" was the first and the best of the three films norman jewison directed concerning racism in america . \njewison has a very keen style of displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental . \nin these three films he does an excellent job creating very detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused to the abusers . \nhe is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present . \npreceding the very original \" a soldier's story \" and the recently released \" the hurricane , \" \" in the heat of the night contains some classic lines and some very memorable characters . \nthe film , which won best picture in 1967 focuses on vergil tibbs , played superbly by sidney poitier as a fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuses to give up on an investigation in a white town where is he not wanted . \ntibbs is a man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him . \nas a hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chains , tibbs is the perfect protagonist . \npoitier also gives an excellent , noteworthy voice to his character . \nnever nervous and always commanding , his speech patterns are very manipulative as they range from stentorian to soothing . \nhowever , unlike \" the hurricane \" where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast , poitier shares the spotlight with rod steiger , who won best actor for his excellent performance . \nas a sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him , steiger shows a great amount of skill in his role . \nhe starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople . \nhe would refer to tibbs as \" boy \" and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him . \nas the film progresses though , there is a very gradual change in the sheriff . \nhe begins to see the hardships tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors . \nwhat i really enjoyed about steiger's character was that he did not completely abandon his friends or connect with tibbs at the end of the film . \nhe still could not refer to tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil . \ninstead , it was apparent that he was eventually going to see the world differently in the future . \nmost movies would have a character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in a matter of minutes . \nthis action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day . \njewison's determination to make this film as realistic as possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate . \n \" in the heat of the night \" shows the difference between the north and the south or a major city and a small town in the united states during the 1960's . \nit displays this perfectly . \nhowever , the actual investigation , although it is not the main focus of the film , lacks interest . \nit seemed rushed especially towards the end as if jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving a credible explanation involving the murder victim . \nthere were way too many characters added during the last fifteen minutes and some of the scenes during this time period were inane ( police officer sam being a suspect was not needed ) . \nalso , it is given that tibbs is a vigilant homicide detective who is the best at what he does , but some of his discoveries came out of nowhere and how he found out some of the important case details towards the end were never answered . \nthe rushed ending was the only mistake of this otherwise memorable jewison classic . \n ( a congratulations has to be given to actor scott wilson . \nhe managed to be in the two best movies of 1967 , \" in the heat of the night \" and the even better \" in cold blood . \" ) \n", "in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer \\ professor with such lived-in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance . \never since wall street , douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid-80's . \nin those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen , with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world . \nyou'd think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good-natured veneer , but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton , douglas played the role straight and out in the open . \nin wonder boys his performance isn't showy or a tour de force , it's simple yet truthful . \nhe embodies grady , a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes . \ngrady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map . \nwhen we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop , we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms . \ngrady points out , in his narration , that they only do so out of jealousy . \ntheir target is the very writerly named james leer ( played by the always understated tobey maguire ) , a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for . \nleer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions . \nhe speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges . \nhe's portentous and gloomy , as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers , though his act is a little too calculated . \nhe reminds me of the self-imposed outcast film director , jim jarmusch ( dead man , ghost dog ) . \nwhenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner ( the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer ) , exclusively dressed in black , and with his spiked hair dyed snow white . \nleer is similar , a guy who equates quirks with depth . \ntobey maguire fits well in the role . \nwith his round , sweet-eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude . \nbut unlike cort , maguire is easier to warm up to ; he's a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility . \nkatie holmes plays hannah , a beautiful , talented writing student just itching to get in grady's pants . \nthis is a plot line i had trouble with . \ndouglas , in his old age , is beginning to resemble jerry springer , a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions . \nat first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady ( maybe it's because i'm jealous , and wish holmes was throwing herself at me , after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth ) , then i think of douglas's real life companion , the breathtaking catherine zeta jones . \nseeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping . \nsuddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand ( that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie ) and i'm pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas . \nthere is a movie in there somewhere . \ngrady , rather chivalrously if you ask me , resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell ( a droll frances mcdormand ) , who is his age , but also married to another professor . \nokay , maybe not so chivalrous . \nthere is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says , \" she was a junkie for the printed word . \nlucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice \" . \nrobert downy j . r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm . \ndowny has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual . \nhe's arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance . \nthe actor is perfectly cast here , and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor . \ni wish wonder boys had more of him . \nsearching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless , for it meanders through its running time , but that's part of its charm . \nand maybe i'm a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia , a place i'm greatly fond of , and a place rarely explored in american cinema . \neveryone has a sub-genre ( be it war films , westerns , dance movies ) that they happen to be privy to . \ni'm privy to films about literary types i . e . \nthose individuals enthralled by the written word , and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch . \nthe direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters , rather than generic mapped out story points . \nsometimes the dialogue is too clever , but that's a problem i wish i found with films more often . \nanother minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted , like its characters , but as the story progresses it begins to open up . \nfor me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types , and as a low-key comedy for its chuckle-worthy throwaway gags . \nthe gags are like those in the great robert altman ( m * a * s * h , the long goodbye ) movies , where jokes exist as asides on the fringes , like jokes in life often do . \nthe broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog , and incessant smoking of marijuana isn't ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things . \ncurtis hanson , who before his last film , la confidential , toiled about with exploitation fare like losin' it ( an early tom cruise sex comedy ) and the hand the rocks the cradle , has graduated to more meaningful films . \nhe directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style , the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up . \nthe morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party , but in a wonder boys party , it fits . \nthe film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen . \nit's the cinematic equivalent to a good read , novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies . \nmany will find it slight , but i found much to savor among its subtleties . \n", "plot : derek zoolander is a male model . \nhe is also very dumb and impressionable . \nfor that reason , he is secretly hired and trained ( so secret , that even he doesn't know about it ) by an underground fashion syndicate to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia , who wants to abolish child labor in his country . \nwill zoolander fulfill the dirty deed ? \nwill zoolander ever grace the world his new \" look \" ? \nis this a funny movie ? \nfind out below . . . \ncritique : there's a place in our world for \" stupid comedies \" . \nfilms which don't pretend to take themselves seriously , are based on idiotic premises and filled with dumb jokes . \nthere's also a time for them and many would argue that this difficult period of our history , might be an ideal circumstance during which to \" relax \" by watching something so completely frivolous . \nwell , if you're in the mood for some seriously mindless entertainment , ben stiller and his cast of many have assembled one of the more original dumb comedies in some time . \nof course , comedies as such are usually very subjective and i could see how some will see this film simply as stupid and unfunny , while others will grant them the \" stupid \" , but consider it funny instead . \ni personally enjoyed it for the most part , cracked up loudly during a couple of specific sequences and loved the derek zoolander character and the unrestrained whipping they released upon the fashion industry . \nsnap ! \nit was also nice to see several real-life models with small roles in the movie , not taking themselves too seriously . \nand if you're the type of person who likes celebrity cameos in films , well , don't look any further because dozens of famous faces show up here including vince vaughn , billy zane , winona ryder , christian slater , david duchovny , natalie portman and many , many others . \ni especially liked andy dick's complete make-over as the masseuse . \nhi-larious ! \nbut with all films of this type , there is bound to be some stuff that simply doesn't work . \na few particulars which didn't strike my fancy included the bulimia and \" orgy \" sequence with christine taylor , the break-dance fighting , and i also never get why they use real countries in plots like this ( why not just \" make up \" a country , instead of zeroing in on a certain people ? ) . \ni also could have done with less of the taylor character in general , since she wasn't all that interesting and seemed to slow things down every now and then ( more zoolander , dude ! ) . \nbut those few missteps were nothing compared to some of the more memorable scenes which definitely did work for me ! \ni almost pissed myself during the \" gas station \" disaster , absolutely adored the \" walk-off \" contest ( with david bowie as the judge , no less ) and appreciated many of zoolander's moronic one-liners ( \" i was a merman . . . a \nmerman ! ! \" ) . \nand i dare you to get his \" monkey \" photo shoot out of your head after seeing this movie ( \" you're a monkey , derek . . . a \nmonkey ! \" ) \ni also really liked the soundtrack and the pace of the film , both of which zipped and zagged , and established a nice rhythm to it all . \nagain , it's to note that this movie is dumb and not for everyone , but my guess is that if you laughed at the trailer , you will likely enjoy many of the quips in the actual picture as well . \nif you thought the trailer was dumb , skip this dodo bird and go rent austin powers again or something , a film from which there is an obvious influence here . \nblue steel , baby . . . yeah ! ! ! \nwhere's joblo coming from ? \naustin powers ( 7/10 ) - austin powers 2 ( 7/10 ) - deuce bigalow ( 7/10 ) - dude , where's my car ( 7/10 ) - freddy got fingered ( 5/10 ) - jay & silent bob strike back ( 8/10 ) - joe dirt ( 5/10 ) - meet the parents ( 8/10 ) - say it isn't so ( 3/10 ) \n", "unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi , an artist whose palette is fabric . \nostensibly , the film is a documentary , but use of that term requires stretching its meaning . \nmany scenes appear staged , and a great deal of cutting-and-pasting has been done in the editing room . \nthe cinema verite effect is a conceit -- genuine spontaneity is at a premium , and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera ( especially would-be actresses like cindy crawford ) . \ndirector douglas keeve ( who was mizrahi's lover at the time ) freely admits that he \" couldn't care less about the truth \" but was more interested in capturing \" the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion . \" \ndespite violating nearly every rule of \" legitimate \" documentary film making , however , unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment . \nwhile it sheds only a little light on the behind-the-scenes world of the fashion industry , it presents a fascinating , if incomplete , picture of designer mizrahi . \nthis man is the perfect subject for this kind of study -- he's funny , energetic , and eminently quotable . \nhe has unusual views on just about everything , from fashion ( \" it's about women not wanting to look like cows \" ) to mary tyler moore ( \" between her and jackie kennedy , they shaped this country \" ) to style ( \" it's almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs \" ) . \nunzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress . \nit's almost certainly different that anyone would imagine . \nthe designer draws on a variety of sources for his look , including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies , then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection . \nin particular , unzipped traces mizrahi's development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show , which highlights a number of prominent models , including cindy crawford , naomi campbell , kate bush , and linda evangelista . \non the technical side , a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped . \na variety of film stocks were used : super 8 , 16 mm black-and-white , and 35 mm color . \nthere is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness -- the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie , and , during the climactic fashion show , color is used to show the audience's perspective , while black-and-white is for the behind-the- scenes sequences . \nnevertheless , some viewers will be put off by this treatment . \nwhile unzipped isn't an expose on the fashion industry per se , keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear . \noverall , however , this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else , and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed . \nwhen the designer declares that \" everything is frustrating except designing clothes -- that's beautiful and liberating , \" it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed . \n", "dora ( fernanda montenegro ) sits behind a make-shift desk at rio+s major train station . \nshe , in her colorful demeanor , offers a service that is unheard of in the states . \nshe writes letters for the illiterate , who pass through , to try to find lost relatives , find love , or search after lost debts . \nshe+s quirky , she+s elderly , she+s caring . \ntotally trustworthy , right ? \nnot a chance . \nonce home , she never sends these letters , saving money on postage , and relishing in the drama contained therein with her neighbor irene ( mar ? lia p ? ra ) . \none of the letters is sent by a young mother with her nine-year old son , looking for their father . \nshortly thereafter , she gets hit by a bus , and the son is orphaned . \ndays go by , and the boy , named josu ? , roams around the station , hungry , desperate , and somewhat clueless to his predictament . \nthrough a series of circumstances too precious to elaborate upon , dora somehow takes a responsibility in trying to find josu ? +s father . \nthis means leaving the security of rio , traveling to the outskirts of brazil , where unpaved roads , religious devotees and the poverty-stricken become commonplace . \nfilms like this remind me as to what i enjoy about some foreign films . \nit is an opportunity for me to get a fresh breath in another part of the world , so distant from my own . \nit does so entertainingly , and so heart-wrenchingly . \nand yet , it+s backdrop is merely that . \nthe focus is on the minute transformation of dora , of how she learns to love this little kid , without being cloying or sentimental . \nthe most interesting backdrop is the amount of religious dedication is in the film . \ndora being an amoral scam-artist , could care less about the amount of bickering between the candle-lighting of the catholics versus the bumper-sticker mentality of the evangelicals . \nbut neither side is trivialized . \nshe even begins to develop an affection for a non-drinking evangelical , who sees the problems with dora , if not initially . \nfernanda montenegro surprisingly got an oscar nomination for this very delicate performance , but the true marvel is that of vinicius de oliveira , who plays josu ? . \nhe , like the discoveries of j ? r ? mie renier ( _la promesse_ ) and giorgio cantarini ( _life is beautiful_ ) , prove that the true acting discoveries may be outside of the united states . \nhe is a natural , and never once grating . \nsend a memo to jonathan taylor thomas . \n", "the event of events is upon us . \npeople have waited twenty-two years for the prequel to star wars and die-hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it . \ni don't think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused . \nit is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history . \nanyone who tells you \" it's just a movie \" is either lying or clueless . \nit is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic . \nthe second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz ( which is far too weak a word ) that star wars epsode i : the phantom menace so effortlessly generated . \nbut that does not mean that the film itself is bad . \nin fact , it is terrific . \ni strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash . \nit is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place . \nthe film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging : the trade federation , angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small , peaceful planet of naboo . \nthe republic sent two jedi knights ( people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as \" the force \" ) , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) to negotiate . \nunable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur , the jedi and the queen of naboo ( natalie portman ) escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene . \non the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine , where they meet the movie's real focal point , young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) . \nhe is an innocent slave boy , but \" the force is strong with him \" so qui- gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi . \nas any self-respecting star wars fan should know , anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker . \n>from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor's movie . \naround 70% of the characters , if not more , are computer generated in one form or another , and though the effects are seamless , the movie lacks soul . \ni think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade , cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this . \nthis is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far , with plenty of broad comic relief to go around , much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar-jar binks . \nhe's essentially a computer-animated sidekick who says things like \" exqueeze me ? \" \nand \" mesa go now , okeday ? \" , and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying . \nthe visual effects are astounding ( although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them ) and the movie is a thrilling triumph . \nif it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement . \nthe climactic lightsaber battle ( oh , come on , as if you didn't already know ) , among other things , is outrageously entertaining and defines the term \" popcorn movie \" . \nwhat made me surrender and give this movie * * * 1/2 stars was the score by john williams . \neven though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days , his work here is nothing short of brilliant . \nhis use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling . \nthe phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia . \nwhen you see \" a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away \" , when the familiar music plays , when the words \" star wars \" appear on screen , you'll feel a tingle even if you didn't see the movie when it first came out in '77 . \nit feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin , a boy whose innocence , we know , will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side . \nit is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts ; we know that it will do more harm than good , but they do not . \nwe not only feel more involved in the story , but we feel like we're seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years . \nthe phantom menace , although lacking in human aspects of the story , is a very worthy installment in the star wars . \nit works as an action flick , visually eye-popping and often paralyzingly exciting ; it also works as an elicitor of memories , a piece of exquisite nostalgia . \n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \n", "sometimes a movie comes along that falls somewhat askew of the rest . \nsome people call it \" original \" or \" artsy \" or \" abstract \" . \nsome people simply call it \" trash \" . \na life less ordinary is sure to bring about mixed feelings . \ndefinitely a generation-x aimed movie , a life less ordinary has everything from claymation to profane angels to a karaoke-based musical dream sequence . \nwhew ! \nanyone in their 30's or above is probably not going to grasp what can be enjoyed about this film . \nit's somewhat silly , it's somewhat outrageous , and it's definitely not your typical romance story , but for the right audience , it works . \na lot of hype has been surrounding this film due to the fact that it comes to us from the same team that brought us trainspotting . \nwell sorry folks , but i haven't seen trainspotting so i can't really compare . \nwhether that works in this film's favor or not is beyond me . \nbut i do know this : ewan mcgregor , whom i had never had the pleasure of watching , definitely charmed me . \nhe was great ! \ncameron diaz's character was uneven and a bit hard to grasp . \nthe audience may find it difficult to care about her , thus discouraging the hopes of seeing her unite with mcgregor after we are immediately sucked into caring about and identifying with him . \nmisguided ? \nyou bet . \nloveable ? \nyou bet . \na life less ordinary was a delight and even had a bonus for me when i realized it was filmed in my hometown of salt lake city , utah . \nthis was just one more thing i didn't know about this movie when i sat down with a five dollar order of nachos and a three dollar coke . \nmaybe not knowing the premise behind this film made for a pleasant surprise , but i think even if i had known , i would have been just as happy . \na life less ordinary is quirky , eccentric , and downright charming ! \nnot for everyone , but a definite change of pace for your typical night at the movies . \n", "that thing you do ! \n ( r ) tom hanks's screenwriting and directorial debut , that thing you do ! , has all the qualities you would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment : fun , lively , and oh-so-nice . \nit is the latter quality , however , that becomes a hindrance , for this '60s nostalgia trifle is so nice and sweet that it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast . \nthat thing focuses on the wonders , a teen rock band from erie , pennsylvania that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in 1964 when they score a major dance hit called , of course , \" that thing you do ! \" \nthe group's members are , naturally a diverse group : there's brooding lead singer and songwriter jimmy ( johnathon schaech ) ; girl-crazy lenny ( steve zahn ) , the lead guitarist ; a goofy , geeky type known only as the bass player ( ethan embry ) ; and the film's center , guy ( tom everett scott ) , the drummer who has aspirations in jazz . \nalong for the wonders' ride to success is jimmy's perpetually neglected galpal , faye ( liv tyler ) . \nhanks proves to be a capable writer-director , deftly recreating the innocent spirit of 1964 , which hanks calls \" the last innocent year . \" \nthe spirit is not only reflected in the period clothes and settings but also in the music , which , like the other recent period music film , grace of my heart , was expressly written for the film ; hanks himself had a hand in writing four of the tunes--but not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger , which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after the end credits have rolled ( it's still playing in my mind as i write this ) . \nit should come as no surprise that hanks the director works well with the actors , eliciting charming , likable work from the entire cast , most notably hanks lookalike scott and tyler , who is remarkable in delivering the film's biggest and best dramatic moment . \nthe work of the young ensemble is so natural that they truly convince as teens of the early '60s ; they do not appear to be '90s grungers playacting \" retro . \" \nyet for all the light , frothy charms of that thing you do ! , it's nearly nice to a fault . \nwhile this unbridled innocence in film is a refreshing change from all the sinful cinema around these days , there is not enough conflict to keep things consistently interesting . \neveryone is so happy , basking in the glow of overnight success , marvelling at it all--except toward the end , but even then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness , ending on an appropriately feel-good note . \nthere isn't much of an edge throughout that thing--the only thing that is remotely edgy is hanks's turn as the wonders' manager--and thus becomes in danger of being so nice it's bland . \nbut a little niceness goes a long way these days , and there's no denying the entertainment value of that thing you do ! ; it's just about impossible to hate . \nit's an inoffensive , enjoyable piece of nostalgia that is sure to leave audiences smiling and humming , if not singing , \" that thing you do ! \" --quite \npossibly for days . \nto paraphrase a passage from the song : though i try and try to forget that song it is just so hard to do every time they play \" that thing you do ! \" \n", " \" he's back , and it's about time . \" \nwas the motto for this television series pilot ( i call it a pilot , i don't care what fox network says ) revival of the cult classic british tv show , doctor who , that spawned no series , which means there are no smart network execs out there ( not exactly news to a lot of people , i know ) . \nthe motto was well chosen . \nthe series was simple , it was about this time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen lives who traveled around in a type forty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddies , including the evil daleks , and the master , who appears in this feature , played very badly by eric roberts . \nas good as this revival was , there is something missing from it to make sure it was really doctor who . \nis it the acting ? \nhell , no ! \npaul mcgann is just as good as any of the other seven guys who've played the doctor ( including his predecessor and off-screen friend sylvester mccoy , who appears once more for the regeneration scene ) . \nhe looks right for the role , is a brilliant actor , and slips effortlessly into the role , the way my two favorites jon pertwee and tom baker would . \ndaphne ashbrook brings class to her role as dr . grace holloway , the doctor's first companion that he kisses on screen , she is not your typical female companion who screams , and spends her free time making coffee for the doctor , she is a tough , spunky american , and ashbrook shows this well . \nyoung yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee , and i've seen him in other stuff in which he usually plays the punk kid who dies at the end ( this film included ) , which , imho , wastes his talent . \nthe only problem with the acting is eric roberts . \none time he had to say to mcgann's doctor , \" i always dress for the occasion . \" \nbut he broke it up , and said it so slowly that it wounded up sounding like a song lyric , \" i always . . . \ndress . . . \nfor the occasion . \" \nyou need an actor less slow and less reliant on moving his hands to act , and who's also british , like mcgann is as the doctor . \nexecutive producer phil segal said he was casted because fox insisted on having one american star in the role . \ni dunno who thought of casting him , but if they're reading this : news flash : eric roberts is * not * a star ! \nhe rides on his sister's coattails , and any hit movie he makes has nothing to do with him . \nis this problem the kisses to the past ? \nthey have references to the show so subtle that non fans would not notice them , only whovians would , and they're good . \nis it the script or the movie as a whole ? \nthe script is a classy piece of work , featuring a master who can spit slime out of his mouth and nice dialogue , and the movie as a whole is one fans will love , and it is a good stand alone viewing for nonfans to enjoy the series . \nso what is it ? \nsimple : no plot . \nthe master , on his last legs , sends for the doctor to rescue him after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro and exterminate him . \nthe doctor attempts to take his remains back to gallifrey , but they accidentally land in san francisco , 1999 , december 31 , where the master , with young street hood chang lee's help , opens the eye of harmony , which will suck the earth through it at midnight if the doctor , with the help of female surgeon , dr . grace holloway , doesn't close it by then . \nvirtually no plot . \ni was told the movie would've featured the daleks on screen and started with more of a courtroom drama between the master and the daleks , but a lot of rewriting went on on the set . \nthat shows how smart people are , as it would have made the movie a hell of a lot more interesting , and that would've gotten a four star rating out of me . \n", "dreamworks pictures

states of denial and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family . \nthe third member of this anti-family is jane burnham ( thora birch ) , lester and carolyn's daughter . \na young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence , but having to also come to terms with her families growing dysfunction . \nthis funny ( and frightening ) slice of life is refreshingly simple . \nnot one character is given less than is needed to identify him or her . \nsome of the most telling characters are those that serve to highlight other characters . \nmost notably is barbara fitts ( allison janney ) , the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts . \nshe has almost no dialogue , and seems to be either recovering from a stroke or suffering from one . \ncolonel fitts ( chris cooper ) is an angry and frightened man . \nhis rage directed almost singularly at his son , ricky ( wes bentley ) who has just moved with his family to the same neighborhood as the burnham's . \nin fact they are the next door neighbors . \nanymore detail into the personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one of the many pleasures and surprises to be had in \" american beauty \" . \nalan ball , who was the co-executive producer of the hit tv series \" cybil \" and creator of the new sitcom \" oh grow up \" , has fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the past ten years . \nnot one character in this film rings falsely . \nand the depth of personality in each , is achingly honest and insightful . \nthe plot detailing the last year in the life of a man as he tries to find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched and at the same time original as to bring to mind such marvelous film work as \" the graduate \" or \" lolita \" . \nkevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances . \nhis lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of a life that is spiraling into old age . \nfinally unable to deal with the lost soul that he has become , lester tries to return to his youth . \nhe quits his job ( actually blackmailing his employer for one year's salary ) , starts smoking pot , fantasizes about his daughter's girlfriend angela ( mena suvari , in a marvelous performance here ) , starts working out , and finally takes a job at the local fast food outlet . \nmr . spacey's performance is so remarkably subtle and ingenuous , that we can be certain that come oscar ? time , we can be assured to see him name among the five nominees . \nannette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career . \ncarolyn burnham is a woman who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy . \nunable to cope with her growing disillusionment , she forces herself to maintain her demeanor , driving her further and further into desperation , adultery and possibly murder . \nms . bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone . \nthe slow and methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express in words . \nthora birch holds her own against the talents cast with her . \njane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in what is a dysfunctional family , and a rebellious child ready to abandon them at any moment . \nher growing distrust and isolation from her family is something that many parents should view as a warning . \nshe is the prototypical trophy child . \nwhen carolyn praises her daughter after a performance by her cheerleading team ( \" i'm so proud of you , honey . \nyou didn't screw up once ! \" ) , the bitterness and resentment are palpable . \nthora birch is a young actress to watch . \npraise must also go to chris cooper who brings yet another angry father role to life with depth and resonance . \ncolonel finn is a man in complete denial . \nhis military upbringing masking a desire he is too repulsed to even comprehend . \nwes bentley as ricky finn is fine as the enigma . \nthe boy next door who may be more foe than friend . \na deceitful and calculating young man , whose voyeuristic proclivities mask a deeper and more profound understanding of life than any of the adults around him . \nmr . bentley's performance is the one troublesome note in the film . \nthat is simply because the character is such a grand and complete liar , that one almost faults the performance for it . \ndirector sam mendes handles all of the particulars of the cast and the settings with a sure and composed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle . \nscenes of carolyn walking through the rain , carry an ominous fission that calls attention to the emotions of the character . \nthe subtle cinematography by conrad hall is wonderful , capturing the season in all of it's harsh beauty ( fall has never looked so inviting , yet depressing ) . \nevery nuance of \" american beauty \" begs it's audience to think and examine . \nit is a film that will be discussed and debated for years to come . \nand well it should , as it is simply one of this years best . \n", "will hunting ( matt damon ) is a natural genius . \nfor a movie character , that's usually a death sentence . \nit's a trait associated with what my brother calls \" too good for this world \" movies , like phenomenon or powder . \nforgive me for spoiling the ending , but will doesn't die . \nthis is no formula movie . \nin fact , it's quite fresh and original . \nit's a character study more than anything , and that's not surprising , considering it was written by two actors : damon and co-star ben affleck . \nwill works whatever kind of job he can get . \nfirst he's a janitor , then he works construction . \noff-screen he speed reads books on any academic subject that interests him . \non-screen he hangs out with his friends , picking fights in robust , romanticized-hemingway fashion . \nlambeau ( stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves ) , a math professor , learns that the janitor ( will ) is a genius with a special talent for advanced mathematics . \nhaving confirmed he's not a fluke or a savant , he does what he can to get will into the education system . \nhe is firmly rejected . \nfinally , will lands in jail for one of his fights . \nlambeau can get him probation instead of prison time as long as will agrees to therapy sessions and to discussing mathematics with him . \nwill ( barely ) decides to go for the therapy over prison . \nlambeau treats will like a son . \nhe's proud of , and amazed by , will's accomplishments in mathematics . \nhe encourages will and tries to give him structure , knowing that , with a little discipline , he could be bigger than einstein . \nwill isn't really interested in academia . \nhe knows he would be the best in his field , and therefore spend all of his time in an office , explaining math to people like lambeau . \nhe would rather work construction , which breaks lambeau's heart . \nmeanwhile , will attends his mandated therapy sessions . \nit's not long before he shreds all the therapists on lambeau's \" a \" list . \nwill has read enough psychology to know the tricks of the trade , and how to keep them from affecting him . \nshrink after shrink refuses to return after will's mockery . \nlambeau's last hope is his old college roommate , now a psychology teacher at a small-time community college . \nknowing that will is going to try to shred him too , sean ( robin williams ) agrees to take him on as a favor to lambeau and for the chance to meet this next einstein . \ntrue to form , will finds sean's emotional weakness and attacks . \nbut unlike the other shrinks , sean knows what he is in for and continues the sessions . \nlike a foster mother with a fussy child , sean knows that the attacks are defensive and is able to take them in stride . \nlike the foster mother , sean knows that time and quiet patience is the only approach . \nrobin williams is excellent in this role . \nhe's not an actor with a great range , but in the right roles he has great depth . \nin this movie , as in awakenings , there comes a point when the quiet , shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance , and a smile of pure joy spreads up to his eyes . \nwilliams is the only actor i can name who can make an audience cry just by smiling . \ni have compared will to a foster child and that's not entirely fair . \nemotionally , he has a lot to learn , but he is not a child . \nhe has thought about his life and made rational decisions about what he wants . \nsean , his girlfriend , his pals , and lambeau all help him grow , but he didn't start out asking for , or particularly needing , help . \nhis exceptional gift singled him out , and those who love him kept pushing him in the right direction . \nif i had to say anything bad about good will hunting is that it walks the line between drama and melodrama . \nit's too sentimental and uplifiting for a straight drama , but the emotions are too subtle for melodrama . \nit is emotionally engaging , but it's not quite larger than life . \nthis isn't a problem per se , but at times i didn't know quite how to take it . \nbut this is a relatively small complaint about a very good movie . \na good movie allows its characters to learn and grow . \nit doesn't just happen ; it takes a good script , good acting , and good direction . \ngood will hunting has all three . \nif you are at all inclined to see it , by all means , go . \n", "if there's one thing in common about all of hollywood's major studios , it's that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more . \nalthough twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures ( fox searchlight and fine line respectively ) , it's obvious there's no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater . \nso when a movie like gary ross' pleasantville comes along , wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production , it's a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes . \nalthough the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted , pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no-thought movie . \nquite the opposite is true , in fact , as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen . \nthe story , both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation , captures the essence of statement-making in the cinema . \nnot in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution , and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross' work , it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough . \nkudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture . \nit stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who , through quite a bit of luck , find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named \" pleasantville . \" \nmaguire , as the reserved bud parker , is perfect for the pseudo-world ; but the rebellious mary sue ( witherspoon ) is not at all made for the father-knows-best times . \nit's not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end , and begins to teach the townspeople - in a quite unlikely way - what life is * really * like . \nsoon hues of color creep into the black and white world , and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism , others fear the strangeness . \nat one end is a soda shop owner-turned-painter named mr . johnson ( jeff daniels ) and at the other end is a close-minded mayor ( j . t . \nwalsh ) and his chamber of commerce ; but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town . \nfine performances are turned in all around . \nmaguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads , but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j . t . \nwalsh ( in his latest and final posthumous performance ) . \ndaniels brings an atmosphere of awe , inspiration , and hope to his character , whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness - almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman's envy . \nfor daniels , it's his most commendable performance of the last three years - or more - and for walsh , it's a complementary exclamation point on a fine career . \nalso of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen , and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish . \nthere's not much to dislike about pleasantville , and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who don't . \n", "what do you get when you slap together a movie based on a story by the legendary george lucas , directed by virtuoso director steven spielberg , and starring one of the biggest box-office stars in the world , harrison ford ? \nyou get one hot-fudge-rockin' good time , that's what you get ! ! ! \nplot : professor/archeologist indiana jones sets out to find the long-lost mystical ark of the covenant before the nazis get their grubby fingers hands on it . \nadventures , snakes , romance and mucho action ensues . \ncritique : astounding movie packed with non-stop action , stunts galore , an interesting story line , great one-liners , a solid cast , a catchy musical score , and all the fun and

action sequences and its gross-out factor at times . \nif you're a little older , you'll appreciate the interesting plot line , the romance , and yes , the mountains of adventure . \nwatching this movie made me feel like a kid again , dreaming and fantasizing about fighting the bad guys , travelling to different countries , making the impossible , possible ! \nharrison ford is perfect as the every-man with the brains of a scientist and the brawn of an outdoors adventurer , and spielberg manages to achieve the ideal balance of action , fun , adventure and humor . \nnow if you really want to have a good time , check into this movie on the same night as its two sequels , rent a jug of iced coke , truckloads of nachos and salsa , an adventure hat and whip , and prepare to gag yourself into a world of action-movie heaven ! \nlittle known facts about this film and its stars : this picture was nominated for eight 1981 oscar nominations , including best picture . \nit lost that award to chariots of fire , but did manage to win for best art direction , best special effects , best film editing and best sound . \nactor tom selleck was originally cast as indiana jones , but was committed to his hit tv show , \" magnum p . i . \" . \nin filming the well of souls sequence , the producers scoured every pet shop in london and the south of england for every snake they could lay their hands on . \nhence there are snakes that are identifiable from many different geographical areas . \nhowever , once all the snakes were on set , it became clear that there were not nearly enough of them , so spielberg had several hoses cut into lengths , and these were used as well . \nlooking closely , you can tell which are the real snakes and which are not . \nan early draft of the script had indy travelling to shanghai to recover a piece of the staff of ra . \nduring his escape from the museum where it was housed , he sheltered from machine gun fire behind a giant rolling gong . \nalso in the same script , indy and marion flee the chaos caused by the opening of the ark in a wild mine-cart chase sequence . \nboth of these scenes were cut from the script , but ended up in 1984's indiana jones and the temple of doom . \nthis film begins with a shot of a peak in the jungle which is reminiscent of the paramount pictures logo . \nthe same type of opening is present in its sequels . \njock's airplane at the beginning of the film has the registration number \" ob-cpo \" . \nthis is a reference to obi-wan and c-3po from george lucas' star wars ( 9 . 5/10 ) . \nalso , the hieroglyphics in the well of souls include engravings of r2-d2 and c-3po . \nthey can be seen on a post to the right of indy and sallah as they remove the ark . \nthe script originally included a long fight between a swordsman and indiana with his whip . \nas legend has it , actor harrison ford was suffering diarrhea at the time , and asked if the scene could be shortened . \nspielberg said the only way he could shorten it was if indy pulled out his gun and just shot the guy . \nthe entire crew laughed and that's how it was filmed . \nwhen indy first falls in the well of souls and is face to face with the cobra , you can see the snake's reflection on the glass dividing it and harrison ford , also some fingerprints and stuff like that . \nwhen indy is dragging along the ground , hanging onto the nazi soldier's truck with the ark inside , you can see the pad that he's being dragged on . \n", "`we run tings . \ntings don't run we . ' \n-sound advice from capone ( paul campbell ) to his squaddie ( or partner ) , floyd ( winston bell ) . \njamaican film , shot entirely on video , featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo-styled brotherhood morals ( and a little gunplay ) . \ncapone , a tough as nails super cop , gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home ( while he was with his lady ) and killed his partner in front of him . \nwhen he arrives , he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse , thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie ( jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw ) , so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook ) . \ncapone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and , much to his disappointment , also finds out his childhood friend ratty ( mark danvers ) has been helping him . \ntorn between doing his job and protecting his best friend , capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again . \ndirected deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne ( assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct ) , one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while . \nshots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films , although the action isn't as hyperkinetic as most of woo's films are . \nthe action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though , and eventually begin to take on a life of their own ( beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after ) . \nthe make-up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well , with flawless squib work on display from the effects team . \nthe cast is superb and listening to their dialogue , spoken with thick jamaican accents ( half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang ) , just adds to the interest . \npaul campbell , as the `loose cannon' capone , essays his role perfectly , displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times . \nmark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty , the part-time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together . \nunfortunately , carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective ( largely because his underlings seem to run all over him ) , but then again , that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed . \nthe music in the film is composed of all reggae songs , and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists , sly and robbie ( who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones , maxi priest , bob dylan , james brown , grace jones , herbie hancock , bootsy collins , and carly simon among others ) . \nthe end credit song , `we run tings' , by the group red dragon , is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review . \noddly enough , desmond ballentine ( who plays the character deportee ) is well known as a pioneer in the realm of `gangsta' reggae as the performer ninjaman , and he doesn't contribute a single song to the film ( that i could see ) , which is virtually unheard of here in the us . \nat the time of this writing , third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us , coming off of a six-month box-office breaking run in jamaica , where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time ( bringing in $21 million in jamaica , which is roughly $500 , 000 us ) . \npalm pictures ( the company that released the offbeat , but entertaining six-string samurai ) is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market , i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters . \nchris blackwell , founder of palm pictures , was also involved in the production of another jamaican box-office smash in 1981 entitled countryman , so i'd say he has a pretty good track record . \noverall , third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo , ringo lam , tsui hark , and many other action films by directors from hong kong . \nif action films are your thing and you don't mind intermittent subtitles , then you can't go wrong with this film . \nthe performances and the story are solid ( if only a little cliched ) and the action is tight . \ni'm not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like , but apparently third world cop's honors are well deserved . \n", "at first glance , it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds . \nthat's true of home alone 2 and i'd bet money that it's true of home alone 3 ( opening soon ) . \nbut home alone actually has a lot going for it , and the cartoon slapstick doesn't get in the way . \nthe mcalisters , all 15 of them , are going to france for the holidays . \nfour adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse . \nthe littlest kid , kevin , is the victim of the older kids' cruelty . \nkevin's patience runs out when he learns that his plain-cheese pizza has already been eaten , and he's going to have to starve . \nhe attacks his big bully brother buzz , who had been teasing him . \nthe fight disrupts the already-chaotic dinner , spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table , a few cousins , and an uncle . \nthe knee-jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin . \nnobody came to his rescue when he was being teased , but they all point their fingers when he fights back . \nthe ultimate punishment comes from mom ( catherine o'hara ) who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night . \non his way up the stairs , he tells her that \" families suck \" and that he hopes never to see any of his family again . \nthat night the power goes out , knocking out the alarm clocks , so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport . \nin a surprisingly plausible setup , kevin is mistakenly accounted for , and the family heads off without him . \nit's interesting that , in a subtle way , his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children . \nfirst they delegate the headcount to an older sibling , and second , they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class . \nthey're two-thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child . \nmeanwhile , kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true . \nhe's finally rid of his family ! \nlife is a dream come true . \nhe can jump on the beds , watch r-rated movies , eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips , and dig through his big brother's secret box . \nslowly , the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane . \nhe grooms himself , he does the laundry , he goes shopping ( \" i bought some milk , eggs , and fabric softener \" ) . \nhe also starts to miss his family , not just for their company , but for the security they bring . \nthe furnace in the basement is a scary monster , the old man next door is a snow-shovel murderer , and two crooks are trying to break into his house . \nmacaulay culkin is cute but he isn't much of an actor . \nstill , we can see that kevin's character grows , thanks to some good direction and editing . \nfor example , acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night , just as \" santa \" is getting in his car . \nkevin asks the man to pass on his request - he wants his family back - to the real santa . \nhe learned how to deal with the furnace . \nyou turn on the lights and it's not so scary anymore . \nhe goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snow-shovel murderer , who actually turns out to be a nice man . \nthey talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid . \nfinally , in the last 20 minutes , kevin confronts his last fear - the bandits , head on ( literally ) . \nthis last act is full of violent comedic slapstick , and after the movie's genuine dramatic setup , it is dessert . \nit's a lot of fun , and it doesn't overwhelm the rest of the movie . \non the whole , home alone is a great holiday movie . \njohn williams' original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls , and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings . \nbut it does have its flaws . \nthe smallest problem is that culkin doesn't act very well . \nas i said before , he is cute , but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkin's insight into his character . \nthe biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda , the villains threaten kevin's life about five times . \ninstead of \" i'm gonna get that kid \" they say \" i'm gonna kill that kid . \" \nsome might argue that the tone is the same , but i strongly disagree . \nmixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux-pas . \ni'll probably never see home alone 3 , and i wish i had skipped home alone 2 , but i do enjoy home alone almost every year . \ndon't let your impressions of the others detract from the original , which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick . \n", "-- comedy , rated pg , runs about 1 : 40 -- starring : john goodman , kathy moriarty , and a bunch of teenagers -- directed by joe dante and written by charles hass -- \nsummary : lawrence woolsley ( john goodman ) brings his new horror film mant ! \nto premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis . \nhe hopes to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town . \nwe see most of the events through the stories of four teenagers and how life affects them . \nquick and easy review : i really enjoyed matinee . \nthe mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely . \nunlike many comedies this film tries , and succeeds , in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh . \nthe makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story . \nthe performances of all the principals are right on the mark , particularly john goodman as the schlock master . \nso i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted , yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours . \nlonger , more detailed review : [beware of spoilers] \nthe primary reason i enjoyed this film was , that while being a comedy , the film also had an intelligent story to tell . \ntoo many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh . \nyou watch the movie , laugh a lot , leave the theatre and take nothing with you . \nmatinee is not like that . \ni left the picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis . \ni found myself wondering what would happen to the characters of the film . \nbut most importantly , i found myself caring about what would happen to the characters . \nthe comedy of the film centers around goodman , his character , and the film he brings to key west . \ni believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today . \nhe is highly expressive both physically and vocally . \ni felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink . \nthe other characters are often lost in a scene with him due to his commanding nature , however , while the star , goodman is actually not at the center of the film . \nthe movie is really the story of the four teenagers , discovering who they are and what they want , against a background where at any minute it could all end . \ni thought the kids reaction were highly realistic . \nthey tried to block it out , they tried to escape from the concerns of their world . \nunfortunately it kept creeping back in , particularly with the fear , and the chaos of the time . \nwhile the comedy centered on goodman , and the drama on the teens , there was a great deal of overlap . \nseveral aspects of the panic are shown in a humorous light . \none example is a scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans and boxes of food in a grocery store . \nif you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for a comedy , but it works here . \nanother reason i like this film is that i like b- science fiction movies . \none of my favorite films to go watch is plan 9 from outer space . \n ( note i did not say it was one of my favorite movies , but one of my favorite to see . ) \nwhile mant ! \nnever got made , many films like it were , and mant ! \nserves mostly as dante's homage to the b-films he loves . \nso again i would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for a good , humorous story . \nthis isn't a gag film like many other comedies but an intelligent , well-thought out , film about real people with real problems told in an often hilarious way . \nenjoy ! \n", "when _star wars_ came out some twenty years ago , the image of traveling throughout the stars has become a commonplace image . \nwhen the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars , we see constellations , meteor showers , and cool space-ships . \nwhen han solo goes light speed , the stars change to bright lines , going towards the viewer in lines that converge at an invisible point . \ncool . \n_october sky_ offers a much simpler image--that of a single white dot , traveling horizontally across the night sky . \nwas it really only forty years ago , when sputnik was launched , and that before then , no satellites ever existed ? \nhave we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see a then-technological achievement , even though it was from the russians ? \nit sounds hokey , but when that scene occurs near the beginning of _october sky_ , i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam , played by jake gyllenhaal . \ndetermined to make a dent in the space race , he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket that could fly like the best of them . \nit is films like this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket . \nwhen lovely teacher miss riley ( played by laura dern ) , suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair , we know exactly who is going to win . \nbut the joy in a film like this is in the little details . \nfor example , homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class . \nif he has any strengths whatsoever , it is an undeterring vision , and a good organizer . \nit means that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school , who knows more about rocket science than he does . \nit means that if his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property ( that is , the entire coal-mining town ) , he must walk eight miles one way , just to set up the rockets , which will fail , fail , fail , and fail again . \nhomer+s dad is played by chris cooper , a favorite actor of mine since _lone star_ . \nhere he plays the antithesis of the character he played in _matewan_ : instead of organizing union rallies , he is the head of the coal-miners , who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions . \nthis is will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year : note how multi-dimensional his character is . \nhe is his son+s last nemesis , as one who most likely interferes with his son+s dreams . \nbut he truly loves his son , and wants to see him succeed the only way he knows how . \nthrough coal-mining . \nbecause of his character , we can see how far we+ve come . \nthe revolution of modern technology has allowed for us to see society advanced at a rate far faster than any generation before us . \nwe don+t understand that there were the generations from the industrial revolution who knew of no other way to raise a family . \nthe paradigm was shifting under the father+s feet , and he knew of no other life . \nso _october sky_ , far from being merely a feel-good inspirational film , offers much food for thought . \nand this is the best type of inspirational film ; the one that you take something with you . \nbtw , the final image of the film is just as simple , is as strong a contrast as the aforementioned horizontal-moving white dot

something to happen . \nnow wait wait , i know most of you loved it , and i'm not saying i didn't like it . \nwhat i'm saying is the first half was extremely slow . \nnow seeing the trailer it makes you think the whole entire movie is one big special effects show . \ndon't be fooled , this movie has a big story . \nand big chunks of talky moments . \nbut i will admit the special effects and the

\nsome of the special effects and fighting were breathtaking . \nthe sound , the music , and all the effects were effective , and the last hour kept us entertained . \nbut with a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes , this movie is at least 40 minutes too long . \none would have wished for a better 'matrix' , but i do have to say , i did like it and i was entertained . \n", "national

mcconaughey , is matt damon , and , like mcconaughey , he proves to be more than just a fresh young face , as evidenced in two radically different projects currently in release--john grisham's the rainmaker and good will hunting . \ndamon has his first major starring role , a la mcconaughey , in a john grisham adaptation--in this case , francis ford coppola's take on the rainmaker . \ndamon plays wet-behind-the-ears attorney rudy baylor , who , immediately after passing the bar exam , finds himself representing the mother ( mary kay place ) of a terminally ill young man ( john whitworth ) in a big-league suit against a negligent insurance company . \nwhile rudy's ( and the film's ) main concern is this case , he also finds time to protect a young wife ( claire danes ) from her abusive husband ( melrose placer andrew shue , in a mercifully brief role ) . \nwritten for the screen and directed by coppola , the rainmaker is the best grisham film yet mostly because it does not take itself too seriously . \ncoppola's most notable--and effective--contribution to the tried-and-true grisham formula is a sense of humor about itself , which largely comes in the presence of danny devito ( as rudy's unlicensed co-counsel ) and golden globe nominee jon voight ( as the insurance company's hotshot attorney ) . \nthe inclusion of the battered wife subplot feels rather superfluous , but danes is as superb as always . \nthen , of course , there is damon , who nicely juggles the weighty ( the insurance case , the spousal abuse ) and the humorous ( rudy's often comical naivete ) requirements of his role without missing a beat . \nas good as he is in the rainmaker , damon showcases the depth of his talent in good will hunting , directed by gus van sant and written by actor ben affleck and damon himself . \ndamon plays the title character , will hunting , a troubled young construction worker/janitor at mit who also happens to be a supergenius . \nin an attempt to steer this brilliant young mind in the right direction , an mit math professor ( stellan skarsgard ) taps his old college friend , community college psychologist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) , to counsel the abrasive , standoffish will and try to help him come to terms with his turbulent life . \ngood will hunting is the touchy-feely enterprise its plot synopsis suggests , but to simply dismiss it as that would be to discount the true emotional chords affleck and damon's intelligent script touches . \neven though no one ( and , if so , _very_ few people ) can directly relate to will's burden of superhuman intelligence , the insecurities he suffers are universal . \nthe material is brought to life by the terrific ensemble of actors . \nwilliams delivers a nice dramatic turn ; affleck , a hot up-and-coming actor himself ( chasing amy ) , turns up in a warm and charming performance as will's best friend ; and the ever-appealing minnie driver shines as will's harvard-schooled love interest . \nthe clear standout in the cast , though , is damon , who bravely does not soften will's prickly nature but has such a natural ease with the audience that it is hard _not_ to care for him . \nso many names come and go with the fluctuations of the hollywood hype machine , but based on his impressive work in john grisham's the rainmaker and especially good will hunting , it is a safe bet that matt damon is one name we will be hearing a lot more of in the years to come . \n", "synopsis : leonard shelby ( pearce ) is a former insurance investigator on the trail of the man who killed his wife . \nleonard has only a few clues to the murderer's identity ; to make matters worse , he suffers from a condition which inhibits the creation of short-term memories , meaning that leonard is always forgetting what happened just minutes earlier . \nbecause of this , leonard is forced to rely on notes he leaves for himself . \n \" memento \" traces the investigation back in time from its apparent culmination . \nreview : \" memento \" is the sort of movie i wish i'd written ; i can think of no higher praise than that . \ni am envious that nolan has concocted such a brilliant , involved , original movie as this . \nan instant film noir classic , \" memento \" is virtually flawless . \nthe script is unlike any i have ever seen -- a notable achievement in these days of recycled hollywood homogeneity . \nalthough the idea of starting at the \" conclusion \" of the plotline and then moving backward in time to the \" start \" is not entirely new , never before have i witnessed it executed with such flair and coherence . \n \" memento \" is endlessly exciting and inventive , a rare story which keeps the viewers guessing during the film itself , and mulling over its connotations long after leaving the theatre . \nand it is not merely an exercise in cerebrality ; there is plenty of action and an unexpected dose of humour to keep the proceedings lively . \nnolan's direction is equally effective , never losing its crispness and clarity despite \" memento \" 's challenging gimmick . \nand to top everything off , all the performances rise to the occasion . \npierce is terrific as the troubled leonard ; moss shows great range as enigmatic natalie ; and pantoliano's teddy achieves a splendidly affable yet sinister quality . \n \" memento \" may be the year's best screenplay , and is certainly amongst the top theatrical attractions of 2001 . \n", "earth is a harsh , unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent . \npeople who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict , as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets : indian and pakistani ; muslim , hindu , sikh , parsee . \nthe story takes place in lahore , which was indian before partition , and pakistani afterward , regardless of what its citizens might call themselves . \nthe action is seen through the eyes of lenny ( maaia sethna ) , a young parsee girl , but it is really about her nanny , shanta . \nshanta has a small circle of male admirers . \ntwo of the men are suitors : hasan ( rahul khanna ) , a hindu , and dil navaz ( aamir khan ) , a muslim . \nthe others--sikh , hindu , muslim--are older ; some are married ; but all appreciate shanta , who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das . \n ( she also starred in deepa mehta's previous film , fire , the first part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water . ) \nin an early scene , the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta and lenny ; political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears . \none of the men remarks , jokingly , that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along . \nhe is wrong : the men make barbed little comments to each other , spoken like jokes , but with an undercurrent of fanaticism . \nthe tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses . \nit is easy to perceive , in these squabbles , the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter . \nthe group around shanta represents , in a sense , a united india , and shanta herself the ideal motherland--one which all love , which inspires hindu , muslim , and sikh to live peacably together . \nbut the circle around shanta is sundered , as is the state . \na sikh is persecuted , hides , then flees . \nanother man is murdered . \nthe group of friends will not meet again . \nthe movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction : a plate shattered on the floor , a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child , and , most brutally , when the tension escalates into violence , a man is held down , tied between two cars , and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles . \nit is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully . \nthe crux of earth's plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz . \nhis sisters are killed in brutal fashion , by hindus , because they are muslim . \ndil navaz seeks solace from shanta , and asks in desperation that she marry him . \nbut she loves hasan , and tenderly refuses dil navaz's offer . \nthe combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him , and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality : the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger and hate . \ndespite the things he later does , it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him , but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things . \nthe conclusion--the consequence of dil navaz's transformation--is rather abrupt . \nthe story earth tells does not end . \nit just stops . \nit is an appropriate finish : giving us closure would have imparted , at least on an aesthetic level , a sense of resolution , of satisfaction . \nbut there was no resolution for india and pakistan--they have been at war , on a small or large scale , for decades . \nsince the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of a nation , it is only right that those dramas should have no terminus . \nthere is no healing to be had , no closure , on any level ( despite the needless , tacked-on ending , with voice-over narration from lenny as an adult , framing the story ) . \nearth is , in some ways , an unexceptional movie . \nit does not reinvent the wheel , following instead the standard pattern of historical dramas . \nbut deepa mehta's directon is assured , and the issues she addresses run deep . \nearth does for india what movies like zhang yimou's to live and tian zhuangzhuang's the blue kite did for china : they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had the bad luck to be caught up and smashed in the crucible of history . \nsuch films strike me as inherently valuable , even when flawed . \nthey may be biased or inaccurate , but they bear the weight of human hardship , and this confers on them a nobility and gravity which other , more inventive films , often lack . \nit is notable that all three movies were banned in their native countries : the events shown may have happened decades ago , but they still touch a nerve . \nthe issues tackled in earth have a particular urgency in light of the nuclear test bombings that took place last year . \nin the near future , india and pakistan may launch nuclear missiles at each other . \nat the time of the tests i had some understanding of the reasons why this might happen ; after seeing earth , i have a much , much better understanding . \n", "up until about a year ago , john travolta's career consisted of those \" look who's talking \" movies ( notice how they never called them look who's talented ) and the 1991 bomb shout ( which was bad enough to make most people scream ) . \nbut somewhere along the line , travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again . \nweird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in 1978 would experience fame and fortune once again , while barry , robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a 1993 straight-to-the-cutout-bin album aptly named \" size isn't everything \" ( and of course , they learned that sales are everything ) . \nbut now travolta's back on the hollywood scene once again , and i think we all know why . \nfour words : contract with the devil . \nand this has nothing to do with newt gingrich's \" contract with america . \" \nno , satan is much more humane . \nanyway , yes , travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld . \nhow do i know ? \ni own the document in question . \namazing what you can buy at those collector's shops for a few hundred dollars , isn't it ? \nget shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction , with travolta as crime minion chili palmer . \nhe goes to collect some of the mafia's money from a b-grade director ( gene hackman ) and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game and into the movie game . \nsure , a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood , but i guess that's beside the point . \npalmer is determined to get hackman's next project made , so he sets out to convince big star martin weir ( danny devito ) to star in the movie , bringing along down-and-out horror actress karen flores ( rene russo ) , who has already had affairs with hackman and devito . \nit doesn't take a las vegas odds-maker to predict that she and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well , after the customary sexual tension and denial , which has been used in every comedy from \" who's the boss ? \" \nto speechless . \nit works in this case , unlike \" who's the boss ? \" \nalthough it's interesting to note that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also . \ncomplicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackman's other films and want in on this one too , along with travolta's mob boss trying to track him down for defecting . \nget shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction , despite the obvious similarities . \nthis movie doesn't have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies i've seen this year ( yes , even better than halloween vi ) . \nget shorty is my kind of movie , one that mixes intelligent humor with action and violence . \ni'm definitely going to have to check out the novel it was based on . \nare you getting this , shorty ? \n", "i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory . \nthis was , of course , a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this . \nnot only did i get to see an advance screening , i was able to see an advance screening of a * very good * movie . \nthe very fast-paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher , a fast-talking , witty , comical taxi driver in new york city . \ngibson's performance is terrific , and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films . \ngibson again teams up with richard donner , as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick , and this time around , the combination works even better . \nthe character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique . \ntry to imagine a toned-downed version of travis bickle who , this time around , is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy cover-ups . \nif you can imagine that , then you've basically got jerry fletcher . \nin many ways , i was surprised by this movie . \nto begin with , i was surprised at how good it was . \ndon't get me wrong , it's not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring , but it was a very enjoyable movie . \nsecondly , i was surprised at mel gibson's performance . \nhe provided a fantastic performance . \nthe previews of this film led me to believe it was an all-out action flick , which after viewing , it was almost the opposite in a certain sense . \ngibson's character has an almost uncountable number of one-liners , hilarious situations , and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film . \nfor instance , jerry's apartment ( and especially his security ) is memorable . \nand last , i was surprised at how good the plot is . \nwriter brian helgeland has created a terrific story , and when watching this film , you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletcher's far-fetched ( or so they seem at first ) conspiracy theories are helgeland's own opinions . \nmel gibson isn't the only stand-out in the film . \njulia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton , the department of justice employee who can't seem to stay away from jerry fletcher , who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories . \nhe also seems obsessed and in love with her . \nbut whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories , she shrugs him and his beliefs off , continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him . \njerry , obviously determined to continually seek out the truth , continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory , which will be printed in his newsletter ( same title as the movie ) . \nalthough he only has five subscribers , he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work , and publishes his next edition . \nvery soon after he does so , he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr . jonas ( patrick stewart ) . \nafter barely escaping alive , jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust : alice sutton . \nthe remainder of the film is almost always fast-paced and full of action and suspense , with jerry's life being constantly put into jeopardy . \nand more along the way , the audience ( and alice ) learn more and more about jerry's life . \nmany things are explained throughout this film , both to the characters and to the audience . \nfor instance , the meaning of the book \" the catcher in the rye \" and its ties to assassins , the reason lone gunmen have three names ( e . g . \nlee harvey oswald and james earl ray ) , and the real truth behind the grateful dead . \nmake sure listen closely throughout the film , as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above . \ndefinitely , when conspiracy theory hits theaters august 8th , make sure you are standing in line to see it . \ni am nearly positive everyone should enjoy this film , especially if you are into an action-thriller with witty dialogue and numerous suspenseful situations . \nand even if you aren't , you should still like this film . \n", "the disney studios has its formula for annual , full-length animated features down so pat that it's hard to remember which one you're watching at any given moment . \n \" mulan , \" their 36th animated adventure , is the latest case in point . \nonce again we have a tale focused around a strong central character ( female as usual ; disney is one of the few studios whose heroines--ariel , belle , pocahontas , and now mulan--get equal screen time with their heroes in recent years ) . \nadd the requisite love interest and a wise-cracking sidekick or two , pep up the soundtrack with a handful of strategically placed show tunes ( an introspective number by a pool or looking in a mirror , a rousing anthem , a cutesy , montage-backed crowd pleaser ) , pose a few threats to our engaging lead , and tie things all up neatly by the closing credits . \nbob's your uncle ! \nbetter make that walt's your uncle . . . \nkids will no doubt go ga-ga over \" mulan \" ( or at least the fast food tie-ins ) , but familiarity can , after a while , leave grown-ups--this reviewer included--wishing for a little more . \nmaybe an animated feature without--shock ! \nhorror ! --the \nsongs , for example ? \nor maybe a film in which a cheeky chihuahua called pepe longs to become a matador from trinidad ? ? \nhow about simply ditching the sidekicks altogether ? \nit isn't gonna happen . \nlike disney's previous entries , \" mulan \" is slow to make its mark . \nthe animation tends to suffer from some slackness in the early going and the humorous element , a madcap dragon wannabe ( in the guise of a loquacious lizard with a case of dry mouth , courtesy eddie murphy's animated vocal talents ) , plays like an inappropriate if necessary ( formula-wise ) afterthought . \nhowever , after about an hour everything comes together and the formula , like it or not , clicks . \nhighlights include a spectacular cavalry charge on a snow-covered pass ( which , due to the sophistication of today's computer-generated imagery , is hard to tell from the real thing ) , a memorable , show-stopping musical interlude ( \" i'll make a man out of you , \" penned by matthew wilder and david zippel ) , and last but not least , mulan herself . \nvoiced by ming-na wen , mulan is disney's strongest female character to date . \nwhen hordes of huns pour over china's great wall and threaten to overthrow the imperial palace , the emperor decrees that every family in the land dispatch one man to serve in the imperial army . \nsince mulan's father is infirm , but proud , the high-spirited mulan steals her father's armor and , incognito , signs up to face the mongolian menace . \nattracted to , but not distracted by , her commanding officer shang ( b . d . \nwong ) , mulan outmatches her fellow combatants in smarts , wit , and physical ability . \nshe's a woman of the '90s a couple of millennia ahead of her time . \n", "i had been expecting more of this movie than the less than thrilling twister . \ntwister was good but had no real

soft at the center . \ngreat wit , great art , and a great villain ( james woods as hades , lord of the underworld and local lounge act ) can't quite stifle the yawns induced by a bland hero , his colorfully monotonous sidekick ( danny devito as the satyrical trainer phil ) , and a largely unremarkable soundtrack . \n ( none of the alan menken/david zippel tunes are particular- ly noteworthy . \nsome lack lyrical snap . \nothers need more memorable melodies . \nboring ballads we expect , but boring production numbers , too ? ) \nso , hercules is a bit of a long sit , but you won't stay bored . \nthe highlights include a nifty round of animated action ( herc battling a cgi hydra ) , a steady stream of anachronisms ( \" somebody call ix-i-i \" ) and pop references ( \" let's get ready to rumble ! \" ) a la aladdin , and several long-overdue jabs at the mouse's marketing and merchandising depart- ments . \nwhile not as rock-solid as hunchback , it's a still a new world of

different levels by different groups . \nfor children , it offers imaginative visuals , appealing new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces , loads of action and a barrage of big laughs ( including numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances , apparently a requisite in contemporary family films ) . \nfor adults , it's a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids . \nall in all , \" shrek \" is a snappy ride , although there are a couple of points i found disturbing . \nbut first the basics . \nbased very loosely on a 1990 children's story , \" shrek \" follows several momentous days in the life of the title character , a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using . \nshrek is a grumpy fellow living a solitary life deep in the swamp , until a local nobleman disturbs his peace . \npetty tyrant lord farquaad ( take away the \" awk \" in the middle and you have the basis of a string of impolite one-liners ) owns the land on which shrek resides . \nhe proceeds to turn the ogre's yard into an ellis island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle . \nas a result , shrek finds himself surrounded by legends like the three blind mice , pinocchio , the big bad wolf , the seven dwarfs , and the three bears , to name but a few . \nan enraged shrek storms to the castle , only to find farquaad ( john lithgow ) ready to bargain . \nlord obnoxious wants to become king and the magic mirror from \" snow white \" has shown him the way . \nall he has to do is rescue a damsel in distress and make her his wife . \nthe mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out of \" the dating game \" ( when snow white is shown , the cheeky announcer purrs , \" even though she lives with seven men , she's not easy ! \" ) \nfarquaad selects the lovely princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) and offers shrek a deal : if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragon-protected , lava moat-filled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the throne , the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds . \nshrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest , accompanied by a motor-mouthed donkey ( eddie murphy ) determined to make the green grump his best friend . \nthey finally hook up with the princess , only to learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet . \nfor the matter , the dragon offers a few surprises as well . \nthe movie references a great many other flicks , from \" babe \" ( \" that'll do , donkey . \nthat'll do \" ) to \" the graduate . \" \nbut the lion's share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney . \nthe public-domain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits ? pinocchio is referred to as a \" possessed toy \" and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin , he bellows , \" get that dead broad off the table ! \" \n ? but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaad's royal domicile , which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom , from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that sounds a lot like \" it's a small world . \" \nwhich brings me to disturbing point number one . \ni laughed at all the disney swipes , but found the mentality behind them a bit sad . \nthe acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known . \nfor years the two companies have tried to sabotage each other's film and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day . \nand now we have katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer . \nhere's a suggestion for the two boys : grow up ! \nput the past behind you ! \nthere's room in the sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads can't play nice , then go to your rooms ! \nthe other area i found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad . \nbeyond all the irreverence , \" shrek \" actually has a message : people should learn to look beyond physical appearances , because true beauty lies within . \nit's a lovely notion , but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaad's diminutive stature . \ndo we really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable ? \nthe pompous , selfish behavior of farquaad is enough to make him a target for zingers . \nadding short jokes is simply mean . \nstill , \" shrek \" is a rollicking good time . \nthe computer animation is mostly impressive ( although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys and the human movements are often jerky ) , the voice work is strong ( particularly from eddie murphy ) , the laughs come fast and furious , and the moral , tainted though it may be , is a good one . \nto trot out a clich ? , \" shrek \" is fun for all ages . \nparents , though , should remind their young ones during the ride home that taunting others because they are short , tall , skinny , fat , etc . is a bad thing . \n", "after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film , you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again . \nthere is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how

apologize to it by saying , 'see you soon .

merely something you eat , not something you like , not something you enjoy , but rather something you experience . \nexperiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses , fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts . \ntrust me , you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point . \njuzo itami's tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western , set in modern day japan . \na stranger , goro ( tsutomu yamazaki ) , comes into town and finds tampopo ( nobuko miyamoto ) , the proprietor of a small , hole-in-the-wall noodle shop , trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman , pisken ( rikiya yasuoka ) . \ngoro , to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles , gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen , emerging bloodied , but victorious . \ngoro finds that tampopo's ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away , just to eat a bowl of her ramen . \nthe problem is , her fare is something less than popular , and less than appetizing . \nhowever , goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest , and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert , enlist the aid of a wealthy patron , and make friends with the former enemy . \nthis film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems . \ntake , for example , when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner . \nthe price is too high , but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum . \ntampopo meets him at his store late at night , and he leads her to a back room . \nshe protests , thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives , but he insists . \njust when she is about to bolt for the exit , he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door . \nshe peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day , her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience . \nthis scene , while comical , is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation , then of relief and discovery . \nthere's also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who , despite their economic trappings , are all gourmets and master sommeliers . \nwe even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet . \nthe scene is meant to bring a laugh , but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor , food is something which everyone has in common , and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all . \nthere are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film , which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in people's lives . \na particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor . \nsurrounded by her children , she is obviously in her last hours of life . \nher husband comes home , and seeing her worsened condition , demands that she get up and make dinner . \nthe viewer knows the husband's intention is not to be mean ; he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived , and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this . \nin a near miracle , the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal , then brings it to her awaiting family . \nas the family eats , she looks on them and smiles . \npreparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her , and for a brief moment , she too enjoys the normalcy . \nthen she falls over , dead . \nfor a moment , the family is stunned , but then the father yells at the children , \" keep eating ! \nthis is the last meal your mother ever made ! \" \ncrying as they do so , the family finishes the meal . \nthe scene is comical , awkward , moving , and beautiful . \nby including the vignettes , itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film , but surprisingly , they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline . \ninstead , they even help contribute to the idea that tampopo's goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble . \nbecause the film parodies a western , the construction of the plot is fairly predictable , but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the \" good guys \" come together for the final showdown . \nin this case , the showdown is against the ramen . \nif they eat tampopo's ramen , soup and all , tampopo knows she has succeeded . \nit's pretty obvious what the outcome will be , but when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life , you can afford to cut it a little slack . \n", "there's an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last . \ngeorge lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy . \nreturn of the jedi , the final installment of the series , is easily the most innovative , action-packed , and entertaining of the three films . \nthe dark , eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone . \ninstead , for return of the jedi , we have good triumphing decisively over evil , a resolution to a love triangle , and walking teddy bears . \neven darth vader doesn't seem very intimidating this time around . \nwith the arrival of the emperor ( an apparition-like creature played by ian mcdiarmid ) , vader has turned into somewhat of a henchman . \nreturn of the jedi picks up at an unspecified time after the conclusion of the empire strikes back . \nluke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , lando calrissian , ( billy dee williams ) , chewbacca ( peter mayhew ) , c3p0 ( anthony daniels ) and r2-d2 ( kenny baker ) are on a rescue mission to luke's home planet of tatooine . \ntheir goal : to save han solo ( harrison ford ) from the clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt . \nit is at jabba's home , a creepy-looking stone fortress guarded by hog-nosed beasts , that most of the added special effects come into play . \nfrom a hysterical scene involving a music group to the dreaded beast outside jabba's sand barge , the effects are top notch . \nas soon as han is freed from his cryo-freeze and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt , it's back to outer space , where the rebel alliance is about to face the empire's newest threat : a second , more powerful death star , that , if activated , could spell doom for anyone who stands against the emperor . \nso , while the fleet prepares for the final battle , luke and company travel to the forest moon of endor to knock out the shield that defends the death star against all attacks . \nthere , they are befriended by the ewoks , the teddy bear-like native race , and luke , fearing that his presence is endangering the group , turns himself over to vader . \nreturn of the jedi has some interesting elements . \nthe scenes which pitted luke against the emperor and vader are suitably tense and well-acted . \nfrom a technical point-of-view , the space battles are amazing , easily hindering anything depicted in the previous films . \nnot only are there many , many more ships , but their speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved . \non one level , return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects . \nin the special edition , even more ships are added , making the final space battle incredibly fun to watch . \nthe acting in return of the jedi is stronger than in the previous films . \nby now ( or then - 1983 ) , mark hamill , harrison ford , and carrie fisher have all matured in their on-screen personas . \nthe chemistry amongst the trio is terrific . \nas in empire , billy dee williams gives us another human hero to root for . \nnewcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as a suitably creepy , cunning , and evil creature , although he's not as imposing as vader was in star wars . \nalthough it was great fun watching star wars and the empire strikes back on the big screen , return of the jedi generates a greater sense of enjoyment . \nwith the spectacular , new special effects , the adorable ewoks , the sinister jabba the hutt , the evil emperor , the same old millenium falcon , darth vader's incredible betrayal , the destruction of the new death star , and the always lovable yoda , return of the jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made with a huge bang . \ncongratulations to george lucas , whose innovative mind entertains us now and will continue to entertain generations to come . \n , \n", "why do so many children's films treat their target audience with utter contempt ? \ntoo many of those who write or direct for children's movies assume that the kids just can't handle serious , thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues . \n \" the iron giant , \" which was directed and co-written by brad bird , late of such animated series as \" the simpsons \" and \" king of the hill , \" assumes that not only can children handle such discussions , but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time . \n \" the iron giant \" holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience , making it a film that's enjoyable for both children and adults alike . \nhogarth hughes ( voice of eli marienthal ) is a spirited young lad who lives with his hard-working single mother , annie ( jennifer aniston ) , in a small town in maine . \nafter staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away , hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception . \nhe comes across a giant robot ( vin diesel ) from space that eats metal for food . \nafter saving the robot , nicknamed the iron giant , from electric shock , hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts . \nbecause of damage he suffered upon landing , the giant has forgotten what his original mission was , so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy . \nrealizing he can't just keep the giant in a barn all the time , and that the giant needs food , he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean ( harry connick jr . ) , an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time . \nit soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth can't keep the giant a secret forever , because a government spook named kent mansley ( christopher mcdonald ) has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security . \nhe suspects hogarth knows something about the giant , and takes up residence in hogarth's house as a lodger . \nmeanwhile , the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind . \n \" the iron giant \" is exactly what family films ought to be , because it doesn' t talk down to its audience . \nthe story is simple , very simple , about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy . \nit's very similar to the spielberg classic \" e . t . , ' and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of \" the iron giant . \" \nthe film holds many of the better elements of spielberg's film , such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy . \nthe film delivers several serious messages , the most important of which is one's ability to choose one's own fate . \nhogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be : a hero . \nthe final sequence is touching and appropriate , though i won't give it away , i will say that very few will be disappointed . \nthe animation , while not up to disney standards ( what could be , after \" tarzan \" ? ) , is good enough to make you forget you're watching a cartoon . \nthe giant is computer-animated , while the human characters are all hand-drawn the old-fashioned way . \nthe characters' faces are done quite well , drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible , but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief . \nfine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth , and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother . \nharry connick jr . does a nice characterization as dean , and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney ( of tv's \" frasier \" ) as an army general called in by agent mansley . \nunlike several cartoon features , each character is actually a developed personality , rather than a stereotype , and is actually integral to the plot , rather than being a superfluous comic-relief sidekick ( a clich ? disney still hasn't ditched ) . \ndean , for example , could have been a stereotypical beatnik ( his character profile seems to suggest that ) , but he is presented as a character with real emotions , thoughts , and motivations . \neven the heavy , agent mansley , is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to , but out of his own fear and paranoia . \na lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper-thin stereotypes and figure the kids won't mind , but \" the iron giant \" has clearly put a little work into making the characters real , and it pays off . \nthe film isn't only around to deliver heavy-handed messages , though . \nit's also very funny , and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy . \nthe scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things , such as dive into a pool , are handled well , and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing , having worked on \" the simpsons \" for many years . \na sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to \" outlast \" one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed , and also extremely clever . \nthe film even takes some jabs at america's nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war , satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to \" duck and cover \" in the event of a nuclear attack . \n \" the iron giant \" has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films , and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing . \ninstead of seeing people get bonked on the head , we get well-timed , clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with . \nwhen you get right down to it , \" the iron giant \" is no more than the story of a boy and his robot . \nthe story is so straightforward , so quaint , that it ultimately becomes charming . \nthough i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person , when it comes to family entertainment , simple is the way to go . \nit's akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word , but it's not the story that sets the film above others of its kind , but rather the elements that go into the story , namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue , which \" the iron giant \" has in spades . \n", "susan granger's review of \" the closet \" ( miramax films ) \nin this hilarious french farce , a shy , boring accountant ( daniel auteil ) named francois pignon discovers he's going to be fired from his job at a condom factory . \nlonely and distraught , he contemplates suicide . \nbut then he runs into belone ( michel aumont ) , an elderly homosexual neighbor , who suggests a \" sex discrimination \" lawsuit to intimidate management . \nas evidence , belone concocts provocative photographs of pignon locked in a leather-clad embrace with another man and mails them anonymously to pignon's boss . \nwhen the racy snapshots start circulating around the factory , not only does pignon get his job back but he suddenly finds himself the focus of attention as an openly gay man . \nhis lusty supervisor ( michele laroque ) is so intrigued that she wonders if , perhaps , she could change his sexual preferences . \neven his ex-wife ( alexandra vandernoot ) and indifferent teenage son ( stanislas crevillen ) drop their disdain . \nbut not everyone is enchanted . \na mucho macho co-worker felix ( gerard depardieu ) , a self-righteous homophobe , is stunned and repulsed when he's forced by the pr director ( thierry lhermite ) to grovel and court pignon's friendship or risk losing his own job . \nwriter/director francis verber artfully milks the farcical comedy as he dissects the hypocrisy of political correctness , veering off-track only occasionally into pedophilia . \ndaniel auteuil ( \" the widow of saint-pierre \" ) is delightful - particularly with a blown-up condom perched on his head , riding on a float in a gay pride parade - and gerard depardieu delivers one of his most restrained , and effective , performances . \non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" the closet \" is a frankly sexual , adult 8 . \nit's so clever , in fact , that hollywood is already planning to re-make it in english , like \" la cage aux folles . \" \n", "roman emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) chooses his trusted general maximus ( russell crowe ) as his successor . \nhowever the emperor's evil son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) murders his father before the announcement can be made , and maximus ( as well as his family ) is sentenced to be executed . \nmaximus is able to escape his executioners , but is later captured and sold as a slave to proximo ( oliver reed ) . \nproximo is looking for gladiators to earn himself money ( he being a former gladiator himself ) , and maximus reluctantly uses his skills to prove himself a powerful gladiator . \nwhen emperor commodus announces that new games will be held in the colisseum , proximo takes his gladiators there to do battle . \nmaximus sees this as his chance to exact revenge on commodus . \ngladiator begins with a great battle sequence between the roman army and germania , and actually is able to maintain interest during the now required \" 40 minutes of exposition after a kick ass opening sequence \" style of moviemaking . \nthe only downfall of the opening sequence is the editing style used . . . \nit's choppy slow-motion which is unsettling and distracting . \nit's similar to the opening sequence in saving private ryan , but nowhere near as effective . \nthe actual gladiator battles are thrilling , but also a bit disjointed . \nmany times it's unclear as to exactly what's going on . . . \nall the audience can tell is that blood is being spilled . \nwe're not sure who's blood or by who's hand though . \nthere's an instance of this earlier in the film too that's disappointing . \nit's comes when maximus escapes his executioners . \nsome flashes and a few quick cuts later and maximus is free . . . \nbut i still don't know exactly how he did it . \nrussell crowe should have become a major star after his gleefully over the top role as a computer generated serial killer in 1995's virtuosity . \nfor whatever reason his stardom never arrived . . . \nbut he should have it now . \nfrom here on moviegoers should now be able to say , \" let's go see the new russell crowe movie \" . \nhe gets the best scene in the film ( and one of the best moments of all recent movies ) when he reveals his identity to commodus in the colisseum . \nit's both rousing and chilling . \njoaquin phoenix does a very effective job of making commodus a person and not just a cartoon character ( which could have easily happened ) . \ncommodus is conniving , sneaky and whiny , but phoenix never lets the character get silly . \nit's a very good ( and very creepy ) performance . \noliver reed died during the filming of gladiator , and it's a huge loss to the acting world . \ni've always been fascinated with reed . . . \nhe's one of those very talented performers who once had a fine career but ended up in direct to video junk during his twilight years . \nit's ironic that this film probably would have gotten him back into real movies again , as he gives a fun and sincere performance . \nthe film is dedicated to him , and he will surely be missed . \nreed's death presented the filmmakers with an obvious problem , as he still had scenes to be completed . \nrather than recast the role ( and end up reshooting a great deal of footage ) , a digital version of oliver reed was created at a reported cost of 2 million dollars . \nironically , that was probably more money than reed ever earned for a single film . \nanyway , this digital effect is only used in one scene that i am aware of ( for about twenty seconds ) and if you aren't looking for it you won't even be able to tell . \nsome of the other digital effects are less convincing however . . . \nand like i always say , noticable digital effects take me out of a movie immediately . \nit's sad that such a good film has these distractions . \nmovies like the fall of the roman empire and spartacus seemed to do okay without the use of computer effects . \nkeep in mind that gladiator is based on real people and real events , but is entirely a work of fiction . \nhowever it's a work of fiction that's great entertainment , and another film to add to the list of damn fine flicks released in 2000 a . d . \n", "what a great film . \nwhat a stunning , touching , heart-wrenching , heart-warming ,

dickens novel . \nin the original charles dickens classic an orphan boy named pip learns about life through his friendship with an escaped convict , his relationship with a bitter old lady named miss havisham , and his hopeless lifetime infatuation with havisham's snobbish adopted daughter , estella . \nthe gist of the story is that an anonymous benefactor sends pip to london for pip to become an upper class \" gentleman . \" \npip leaves for london with \" great expectations \" to be groomed into a gentleman so that he can one day be classy enough to marry estella . \nbut life has a way of complicating things . \npip becomes an arrogant s . o . b . \nuntil he learns just who his secret benefactor is . \nin this new 1998 version of great expectations a poor florida lad named finn ( ethan hawke ) with a talent for drawing has an early memory of helping an escaped convict ( robert de niro ) . \nbut soon the focus of finn's life becomes romance , as he develops a lifelong infatuation with estella ( gwyneth paltrow ) , an upper crust girl with some psychological and emotional issues due to being raised in a dysfunctional environment . \nestella was raised in wealth by ms . dinsmoor ( anne bancroft ) , an eccentric , aged and embittered , man-hating single aunt whose groom left her abandoned at the altar on the day of her marriage . \nthis causes estella to 'fear the daylight' of relationships , but finn thinks it's just a case of snobbery . \nwhen finn becomes a young man , an anonymous benefactor sets finn up in new york with the connections and publicity to be groomed into a famous artist . \nfinn leaves florida with \" great expectations \" to be a successful artist so that some day he might become classy enough to marry the snobbish estella . \nwhat will happen to all of finn's \" great expectations ? \" \nopinion : if you're looking for a romance with a happy ending , look no further ; you've found one here . \nethan hawke is romantic lead . \n ( he romanced winona ryder in reality bites . \nhe romanced julie delpy in before sunrise . \nhe romanced uma thurman in gattaca . \nnow in great expectations he gets to chase gwyneth paltrow , a rail-thin blonde . ) \nhawke plays a lovestruck , earnest and unchanged finn throughout the film . \nmeanwhile paltrow portrays estella as alternating between infuriating tease and ice princess ; estella's whole purpose is to get men to fall in love and then hurt them rather than become intimate . \nanne bancroft goes a little overboard as the deranged and pessimistic ms . dinsmoor , while robert de niro carries off the convict part suitably . \nthe difference between the classic dickens novel and this 1998 adaptation is that the dickens novel is ripe with deep and timeless themes about class struggle and love , whereas great expectations ( 1998 ) is more artsy , less complicated story about a 1990s artist dealing with a lifetime tease . \n", "you've seen this moment before , recently : a particularly troubled character senses danger of the paranormal kind when the room temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing . \nthe difference is that when it happens to lili taylor's nell in the haunting , we don't care . \nthe hero of the sixth sense , a young boy named cole , is a rich creation , and we wish nothing more than for the ghosts who haunt him to take a hike . \nthe seasons have changed since an ex-patient shot jaded child psychologist malcolm crowe ( willis ) in the comfort of his own bedroom . \ndesperate to get his career back on track , even at the expense of his crumbling marriage ( to williams , of rushmore ) , malcolm councils the deeply troubled cole ( osment ) . \nthe preteen displays all the quirks of malcolm's would-be killer : scars on his body ; antisocial behaviour ; and the reluctance to reveal a big secret . \nonly after cole is locked in a closet by some bullies ( and hospitalized as a result ) does he divulge to malcolm , in a spine-tingling scene , that he sees dead people walking among us , all the time . \nmalcolm assumes , and given his profession , reasonably so , that cole is schizophrenic , not psychic , but the sincerity in cole's anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures . \nhe will instead pursue the supernatural angle , becoming a kind of surrogate father to cole ( who lives with his single mother , lynn ( collette ) ) in the process . \nthe sixth sense has more in common with ghost than poltergeist . \n ( though shyamalan does , somewhat unforgiveably , crib the self-rearranging kitchen business from the latter . ) \nit's far more heartwarming than frightening , and the film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks . \ncole attracts the dead for reasons unknown , but they're not out to harm him , really-they just want to be heard , even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the innocent gradeschooler . \nperhaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to us , at first , than they really are because we're looking at the situation through the eyes of an eight-year-old . \nthat's right : willis , for the first time in years , gives up the spotlight to his costar . \nwe appreciate malcolm's domestic dilemma , but we identify with cole , recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or the thing under the bed . \nboth actors deliver immensely likable performances , and their dynamic is manifest . \nwillis convinces us that he's a doctor , something he was unable to do as a horndog shrink in the overheated color of night . \nosment is phenomenal , a true professional who resists mugging for the camera like some child stars with too much experience in television commercials do . \nthe sixth sense ( atmospherically shot by the silence of the lambs' cinematographer , tak fujimoto ) is actually a drama-its spooky , effective ad campaign is misleading . \nonly because i was expecting something different did i notice-rather , feel-the movie's running time , which is just shy of two hours . \nthe story unfurls slowly but engrossingly ; its unexpected finish is definitely worth the wait . \ni'm not sure said big twist ending is bulletproof , but i admired its audacity . \n", "hollywood has really done the whole dracula thing to death ( no pun intended - honest ) . \nit's a shame , too , because the good count was probably the most frightening out the old b-movie monsters . \ni mean , come on . \nare people really going to get that scared over a big green guy named frankenstein that moves at a speed of five miles per hour ? \nhell no . \nand not only was the idea of a vampire frightening as hell , but it also carried with it a kind of sensual feeling as well , not commonly associated with horror films . \nand not only has the idea been done too many times , but with the possible exception of from dusk 'till dawn , has not been done very well lately , either . \nthis is precisely why it was so much fun for me watching the original nosferatu . \ni got to go back to the times when making movies ( even horror movies ) was considered an art form , and not just done to make cash like nowadays . \nand that is exactly what this film is ; art . \ni've been a horror fan since i was eight years old , and to this day i have not seen any horror film cover the intellectual ground that this film covers . \nlet me backtrack a minute . \nwhen i say \" intellectual ground \" , i don't mean that nosferatu tackles philosophical questions or anything like that , i just mean that in order for the film to work the way it was intended to , a little bit of thinking is involved . \nwith most modern slasher movies like friday the 13th and what-not , you can just simply sit back in your chair and be frightened by the gore that is shown . \nthose movies could have been made by a fifth grader with a good makeup kit ; movies like this require the viewer to actually pay attention and ponder what is happening on the screen . \nyou see , this movie has barely any violence in it and even less blood or gore . \nthis is a thinking man's slasher flick . \nthe \" nosferatu \" of the title is orlock ( max shreck ) , a strange , hermit-like count that , as the film opens , is looking for a new home to buy . \nhe employs the help of hutter ( gustav von wangenhein ) , a real estate salesman ( or something to that effect ) who has a nice home and even a fiancee named ellen ( greta schroeder ) . \nupon orders from his boss , hutter treks to the transylvanian mountains to visit orlock's castle and speak to him about his new home ( which just happens to be right next door to hutter's ) . \nthe next morning , he wakes up to find teeth marks on his neck . . . not \nreally a good sign . \nhe then discovers through some reading that the count is a \" nosferatu \" , or vampire , one of the undead that feeds off the blood of living humans . \nbut by the time he pieces this together , he is too late ; orlock has already embarked to hutter's hometown via boat . \nwill hutter reach his destination in time to save his fiancee from the deadly clutches of count orlock ? \nthe character of orlock is , of course , dracula . \nthe only only reason his name was changed was because this was an unauthorized account of bram strocker's novel . \njust thought that was an interesting little side note . . . \nprobably the only way you will get to see this fine film is by purchasing a copy of arrow entertainment's digitally restored cut , now available in stores . \nhowever , this version is quite different than maunau's original masterpiece . \nthe movie is now sporting a new soundtrack by band type o-negative and color tinting , much like the 1984 version of lang's metropolis . \nnow , i really appreciate what arrow entertainment is trying to do here , bringing a classic like this to the attention of a wider audience that might have otherwise just skipped this one . \nbut alas , i like watching movies the way they were originally intended to be seen . \nbut that's just my bag ; you may like the newer , more \" modern \" version better . \neither way , i suggest investing your money in a copy . \nif you like what they have done with it , pop it in the vcr and enjoy . \nif you're like me , just do what i'll do during future viewings ; turn the color all the way down on your television , hit mute , turn on some bach or mozart or whatever , dim the lights and prepare to view what is truly one of the greatest films ever made . \n", "stendhal's syndrome : a condition where , in the presence of art , a person becomes engulfed in a painting and hallucinates and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression , suicidal behaviour and personality disorder . \ngrim stuff , to be sure , but the subject of a remarkable film from italy's master of the horror thriller dario argento . \nboasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music ennio morricone , the stendhal syndrome is a quite magnificent return to form for argento . \nit follows his disappointing american debut trauma ( 1992 ) , the patchy opera ( 1987 ) and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi in the late 1980's . \nbased on the novel by graziella magherini , the film stars argento's daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of a brutal rapist-killer . \nvisiting florence to follow up several leads , she is lured by the killer alfredo ( thomas kretschmann ) to an art gallery , a favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is on his tail . \nat the gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting and faints . \nposing as a bystander , alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer , a strange game of cat and mouse begins . \na gripping story evolves , and a coherent one , too , which may surprise those familiar with argento's often lumpy narratives . \nthe stendhal syndrome is not a simple cop-hunting-killer scenario . \nit is a disturbing and often compelling study of the central character's psychological disintegration . \nthe script explores its psycho-sexual themes with intelligence and candour , perhaps too much so for more sensitive viewers . \nbut as dark as its themes are , the stendhal syndrome emerges as one of the most artful and effective european thrillers of the last ten years . \nargento is once again working in his native italy , and he fully exploits the opportunities to use art and architecture for both symbolic statements and as departure points for several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences . \neffects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his director well here , and the cinematography by giuseppe rotunno is consistently excellent . \nthe film's opening 20 minutes segues between hallucination , flashback and real-time with tremendous style . \nproof that , at his most inspired , argento remains one of the world's most exhilarating filmmakers . \nthe cast is generally good , though marred at times by dubbing into english that renders speech all but emotionless . \nasia argento's performance is by turns risky , awkward and fascinating . \nit's a difficult role , and given her relative inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts . \nthomas kretschmann is chillingly effective as alfredo , and marco leonardi ( of cinema paradiso , and possibly the most gorgeous looking man in italy ) does okay as anna's work colleague and increasingly confused love interest . \nbut perhaps the stendhal syndrome's single most striking element is ennio morricone's soundtrack . \nactive since the 1960's , morricone has scored over 100 films in his career and this must rate as one of his finest efforts . \nit's mostly a variation on the one theme : a slow circular melody for strings and wordless female vocal possessed with an extraordinary , haunting beauty that lingers long afterwards . \nit's been three decades since argento and morricone worked together . \nthis is a long welcome reunion . \nif the film has a fault , it is that the last half hour drags a little and the film doesn't quite reach a completely satisfying climax . \nbut by the closing scenes , the stendhal syndrome has already offered us enough to qualify as one of the very best films of dario argento's career . \n * note : see the uncut print from japanese laserdisc if you can . \ndubs of this version are available from various video dealers on the world wide web . \n", "close your eyes for a moment , if you will , and imagine the sound of stephen rea's gaelic brogue , silky smooth and irish like a pint of guinness . \na lackadaisical , naughty little schoolboy voice that flirts and gambols . \nan acerbic , sing-song metered voice that evokes the startling imagery and language of anthony burgess' \" a clockwork orange . \" \na voice that deliciously conjures scenes both porcine and puerile , like those out of \" delicatessen , \" or \" the tin drum . \" \nimagine all of that , and you'll get a good sense of what you can expect from \" the butcher boy . \" \nimagine that and more . \nneil jordan's latest film \" stars \" rea in more ways than one . \nrea , the accomplished irish actor most notable from his star turn in jordan's \" the crying game , \" contributes a restrained and managed performance as da brady , a small town drunk in an unnamed irish community in the 1960s . \nbut it's his wall-to-wall narration as the butcher boy of the title , da brady's son , francis , that makes rea's \" performance \" worth watching , worth listening to . \nand that's only half the fun . \nplaying the young francie brady is newcomer eamonn owens and he is , without a doubt , a revelation . \nfor as much as rea's voiceover permeates almost every scene of \" the butcher boy , \" owens commands virtually every frame . \nit's impossible to take your eyes off him . \nwith his crop of carrot-colored hair , ruddy complexion , and overall grubby appearance , francie brady is an unlikely hero , refusing to be done in by his alcoholic , trumpet-playing father , his depressive , suicidal mother , or the neighboring , bespectacled monster known as mrs . nugent ( fiona shaw ) . \nin fact , everything was ok until \" the nugent \" came to town . \nnow , she poses as much a threat to the safety and security of town bully francie and his best pal joe ( alan boyle ) as the looming commie menace ( \" the butcher boy \" is set at a time when the fear of nuclear obliteration is first and foremost in the minds of many ) . \n \" pigs ! \" screams mrs . nugent at the brady menagerie . \n \" you're all pigs ! \" \nit's the start of many a related image . \nafter ma brady is shipped off to the \" garage \" for psychiatric observation and da brady downs one bottle of whiskey too many , francie finally loses grip of his fantasy world of cowboys and indians , the lone ranger , and other comicbook characters . \nsquealing like a stuck pig , francie does \" the likes o' that \" on the nugent's living room floor , and is himself whisked away to a very catholic remand home for \" boney arsed bogmen , \" where his ever fertile imagination--and clever chicanery--runneth over . \ndirector jordan's vivid treatment of pat mccabe's nightmare novel produces a sometimes disturbing , dark comedy littered with surreal touches ( such as sin ? ad o'connor playing the virgin mary ) . \nit's not as outlandish as the trailers make out ; instead , this remarkable film focuses on the effects external influences have on the friendship between two boys ( schoolboy chums in real life ) , allowing us to empathize with their plight in the presence of extraordinary behavior . \nit's bleak and it's black but it's fundamentally very funny . \nrea talks us through it , beautifully , and owens drags us though it , admirably , and , in tandem with jordan's sure hand , theirs are contributions to make \" the butcher boy \" a film worth savoring . \n", "zero effect gets its title from the main character , daryl zero ( bill pullman ) , although we don't understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film . \nzero is a private investigator , perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived ( at least he'd like to think so ) . \nhowever , he's a socially inept being , and eccentric in every possible way -- this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are . \nzero's accomplice is steve arlo ( ben stiller ) , a \" normal \" guy who does the business side of the job -- he's the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zero's greatness as an investigator . \nthe opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zero's talents to soon-to-be client gregory stark ( ryan o'neal ) . \nit turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box , and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about . \nzero takes the case , and the plot thickens . \nhis path leads to a young , pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) . \ndespite her luminous and seemingly-harmless presence , she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark . \nthrough his investigations , zero learns why , but not without developing feelings for gloria -- feelings that , because of his reclusive behavior , are new and confusing to him . \ni have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film . \ni can idly enjoy movies about private investigators , and , every once in a while , a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me away ( actually , no private eye film has ever reached chinatown's greatness ) . \nzero effect , which is jake kasdan's first effort as writer/director , is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts : it's an original , funny , and completely involving motion picture . \nwith so many cliches available to this genre , i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them . \nbut he didn't just successfully avoid flaws : he has created a great film here , one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment . \ntake , for starters , the great cast of characters . \npullman is terrific as zero , showing a comic flair that i really haven't seen from him since spaceballs . \nzero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here ; the fact that he's an almost exaggeratedly twisted , emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe . \npullman's performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance , and the occasional voice-over as he's going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious . \nben stiller is also a very funny individual ; he's the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny . \n \" i'll shoot you , \" he says to stark at one point . \n \" i have a gun , and everything . \" \nhis character is also well-drawn , with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend ( angela featherstone ) who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job . \no'neal also gives his character a bit of depth ; and kim dickens , last seen ( and underused ) in mercury rising , gets a chance to show us her talent here , giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs . \ni find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film . \nkasdan's humor is of the best kind -- soft spoken , and mostly dialogue-driven ( though there are some great visual jokes ) . \nit's the kind of humor that's funny even after you've seen it five or six times . \nthere's one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is , an how that makes him such a great detective . \nwhat we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed , or standing motionlessly , with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face , his eyes pointing to something off camera , but obviously to nothing in particular . \ni can't convey to you how funny this is , but what makes it great film making is that it has a point -- scenes like this are frequent , and they provide solid characterization of zero . \nas a side note , i don't consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy ( not to sound elitist ) -- i find things funny that many do not , and vice versa . \nthere was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film , and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it . \ni have a feeling the humor here won't appeal to everyone , but there's certainly enough story and character development to keep anyone's interest . \njake kasdan , son of writer/director lawrence kasdan , is only 22 years old . \ni found this out after seeing the film , and i can't remember ever being so impressed with a film maker . \nhis direction is stylish without being pretentious , and his writing is mature , full , and developed . \nzero effect is the kind of film that i'll buy for my collection -- smart , original films like this are rare as it is , but this one actually has a heart and a soul . \nat the end of the film , i was involved in the characters , and i was satisfied with the outcome . \nand , with kasdan's undeniable talent at such a young age , all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future . \n", "the long kiss goodnight ( r ) meryl streep tried it and failed . \neven pamela anderson lee made an attempt but fell flat on her well-bared assets . \nhowever , geena davis could very well become the first bankable american female action star with the long kiss goodnight , a preposterous but incredibly fun action thriller directed by her husband , renny harlin . \ndavis plays samantha caine , a mousy suburban school teacher and mother whose memories only go back eight years . \nwith the help of ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey ( samuel l . jackson ) , she slowly remembers--and reclaims--her past as charly baltimore , tough-as-nails cia operative . \nneedless to say , with the reappearance of samantha/charly comes the appearance of an assortment of no-goodniks out to erase more than her memory . \nshane black netted a cool $4 mil for his script ; i'm not so sure if his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag , but for what it's worth , it delivers the goods . \nlike black's previous work , such as lethal weapon and the last boy scout , the script juggles some impressive action scenes with funny , quirky dialogue . \nthe humor especially works well in this case , for the story is so preposterous that the laughs help to keep things from taking things too seriously . \nbut there's no argument that the more unbelievable sequences are original and entertaining as hell : who can resist the sight of davis tossing her daughter from a hole in her house into the nearby treehouse or chasing after a car . . . \nwhile ice skating ? \njackson and davis make a good team . \njackson is funny as ever as ever ; in fact , his spirited line deliveries , especially when he first appears , are more than reminiscent of his work as jules in pulp fiction . \nas good as he is , the one who should benefit the most from this project is davis , who shows much promise as an action heroine . \nwhat makes her so effective and why she should succeed where streep and lee failed is that she doesn't take herself too seriously . \nshe is obviously in on the joke , slyly taking jabs at herself and at the situation . \nthis is not to say that she doesn't need work--sometimes she lays on the \" toughness \" a bit too thick and comes off too much as a caricature . \nbut should the public embrace the film and , in turn , the notion of a kick-ass female , davis could have found her special niche . \nit seems as if davis and harlin's first collaboration , the middling pirate epic cutthroat island , was just a dress rehearsal ( albeit a very costly one ) for long kiss , in which the wife-husband team hit their action stride . \nanyone simply looking for a fun , escapist entertainment that requires little-to-no thinking will find this film to be a more-than-welcome kiss . \n", "screen story by kevin yagher and andrew kevin walker . \nscreenplay by andrew kevin walker . \ninspired by the short story the legend of sleepy hollow by washington irving . \ndirected by tim burton . \nstarring johnny depp , christina ricci , and casper van dien . \nspecial appearances by christopher lee and christopher walken . \nsynopsis : investigator ichabod crane journeys to 1799 sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders involving decapitation . \ntownspeople believe the spirit of a dead german mercenary is threatening them . \ncute blonde katrina and a listless orphan help crane solve the mystery . \ncomments : tim burton has directed a number of entertaining and groundbreaking films over the years . \nbatman , of course , is perhaps his best-known film and led to a string of less successful sequels . \nhe's done biographical work ( on the director ed wood ) , children's movies ( nightmare before christmas ) , and a homage to alien invasion movies ( mars attacks ! ) . \nsleepy hollow , his newest feature which fans have been anticipating for a while , shares the similar dark and atmospheric style of his earlier work and counts among his better movies . \nsleepy hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old period horror films of the 1950s and 1960s , especially hammer studios' reworkings of dracula and frankenstein , and american international's series of movies based on the works of edgar allan poe . \nchristopher lee , in fact , star of many hammer productions over the years , appears at the beginning of sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out to investigate the murders . \nthe movie also borrows from the universal monster movies of the 1930s . \none of the climatic scenes involves a windmill and obviously takes its cue from frankenstein . \ni mention these allusions for a reason . \nseasoned horror film fans , including myself , will smile at their inclusion in this film . \nwith the recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies , especially the blair witch project ( the most overblown turkey of the decade ) , we needed a film like this . \nnot only does it have a sense of history , but burton's skillful use of setting and mood make this an entertaining exercise in horror . \nthe film's eerie landscapes and foggy towns , indeed , overshadow the actors and the plot as the most noteworthy aspect of the movie . \njohnny depp , a veteran tim burton actor who has appeared both in ed wood and edward scissorhands , plays ichabod crane , who has apparently changed occupations from irving's original story and is now an investigator . \ndepp is adequate in his role . \nno more ; no less . \nequally adequate is christina ricci , who plays the love interest in the film . \nshe's a good witch too . \nhow cute . \none of the few weak parts of sleepy hollow is the wooden and cliched dialogue between the main characters . \nthe two actors , however , carry the movie well enough , but the supporting cast is what makes this movie shine . \nveteran actors such as jeffrey jones and michael gough ( who played the butler alfred in all four recent batman flicks ) are terrific as the aging townsfolk involved in the conspiracy which depp uncovers . \nwhile i do not wish to reveal crucial plot points , i can say that the storyline becomes quite confusing . \nyou have to pay attention . \nandrew kevin walker wrote the screenplay . \nhe's the one who also wrote 8 mm and seven . \nwalker is quickly becoming one of the premiere suspense writers in hollywood , and sleepy hollow certainly doesn't hurt his growing reputation . \nas one might imagine from a gentleman like walker , sleepy hollow is quite graphic . \nthere's a lot of blood and a lot of beheadings . \nthis is definately not a flick to take the young kids to . \na lady in front of us took her two young sons to see it and spent about 25 - 30 minutes covering the youngest's eyes with her hand . \nhe was obviously upset by the movie's intense violence . \nif you're looking for a good scare , however , sleepy hollow is definately recommended . \n", "mpaa : not rated ( though i feel it would likely be pg , for martial-arts violence . ) \nwith three movies already ( re ) released theatrically in america , and at least three more on their way , jackie chan is one of the newest \" hot properties \" in action adventure stardom , and it's just about time . \nfor over twenty-five years , jackie's been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong , thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy . \n \" drunken master \" has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to \" make it big \" --this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong . \ni'm not entirely sure why , exactly . \nin many ways , \" drunken master \" is similar to most of jackie's other early films , such as \" fearless hyena \" i and ii , \" master with cracked fingers \" , \" half a loaf of kung fu \" , \" spiritual kung fu \" , and others . \nin fact , looking at all these early films together , one gets the impression that they were stamped out , cookie-cutter style , at a rate of four to six per year , all using the same casts and telling very similar stories . \nto be honest , i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste . \nthey're quite different from action movies as we know them in america . \nthese films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past , with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together . \n \" drunken master \" , though its plot is tighter than some , is no exception . \n ( as an aside , \" drunken master \" was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw , and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen . . . in \na movie theater in seattle , as part of an asian film festival . \nat the time , i didn't really think it was anything special . . . but \nafter having seen more films like it , it's kind of grown on me . ) \n \" drunken master \" 's storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies , such as \" fearless hyena \" i and ii and \" master with cracked fingers \" --slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh-seeming master , and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end ( a formula that has been \" adapted , \" to put it kindly , by american films such as karate kid ) . \nmore specifically , jackie chan plays the part of wong fei-hong , aka \" naughty panther , \" a fun-loving , practical-joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good , but not _quite_ good enough . \nafter embarrassing his instructor's assistant by beating him roundly , then beating up a bully in a marketplace , wong fei-hong tries to hit on a pretty girl , but discovers that she , and her mother , can hit back , better than he can . . . and \nis further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt , respectively . \nhis father , wong kei-ying , is unhappy about this , and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages . \nkei-ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment , which fei-hong does not like at all . \nwhile escaping from this punishment , fei-hong meets up with a drunken old man , who proceeds to thrash him soundly , then take him on as a student and thrash him some more . \nthis turns out to be su hua-chi , a legendary master of drunken-style kung fu . \nhe assigns fei-hong a series of bizarre tasks , such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame , cracking walnuts with his hands , and other such exercises , that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up . \nthen , when he's ready , he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu . \nunfortunately , the lazy fei-hong only practices six of them . . . \n \" drunken master \" features some wonderful martial arts sequences , with jackie winning some fights and losing others . \nit's been said before , but i'll say it again--these fights don't just _happen_ , they're as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance , and it shows . \nin his fights , jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment-- benches , jugs , cups , bowls , fruits and vegetables--often in new and surprising ways . \nthe fight scenes , particularly those toward the end of the film , are unparallelled in most american films . \nwhether jackie wins or loses , it's really something to see . . . and \nit's often as funny as anything , too . \nand funny is the other thing jackie chan is very , very good at . \nthere's very little that's new in this movie--jackie winning fights , jackie getting beaten badly by a master , jackie going through punishment or training . . . these \nschticks have all been seen before , in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties . \nbut they're still hilarious as ever . \nlikewise , jackie has a _great_ supporting cast , many of whom were also in other early jackie films , and they're often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own . \nthe really big thing about \" drunken master \" , though , that inspired several copycats ( including a couple starring jackie himself ) and a sequel fifteen years later , was the drunken-style kung fu . \ni'm not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu , but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security . . . and \nit apparently helps if you're drunk while you're doing it . \ngenuine or not , i have to admit , there's just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what's going on . \ncome to think of it , perhaps this element is what accounts for this film's success over any of the other jackie films . . . it's \nnot just martial arts , it's the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go , \" whoa . . . \" \non the negative side , the cinematography in this film is nothing special , the film stock is rather primitive , the plot is often rather slow , and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background . \n \" gone with the wind \" , this isn't . \nstill , if you like martial arts films , or like what you've seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more , give it a shot . \nit's much more \" real \" than chuck norris or jean-claude van damme . \nyou might very well like it . \nanother interesting thing about \" drunken master \" has to do with its video availability in the us . \n \" drunken master \" is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original , letterboxed , hong kong subtitled form , commercially available on vhs ( from magnum video , in a gold box , for about $10 ) . \nthere are plenty of other early jackie films around , but these are typically either in dubbed , pan-and-scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase . \nthankfully , \" drunken master \" , at least , is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen , at a very affordable price . \nif you like \" drunken master \" , take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there ( even the dubbed ones aren't really _too_ bad . . . if \nnothing else , you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue ) . \ni particularly recommend \" spiritual kung fu \" , \" half a loaf of kung fu \" , the \" fearless hyena \" movies , and \" snake & crane arts of shaolin \" . \nalso , the mostly-unrelated-storywise sequel , \" drunken master ii \" , will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year ( though what its american-release title will be is still uncertain ) and comes _highly_ recommended by this reviewer . \nalso , for a rather different interpretation of the character wong fei-hong ( who is in fact a popular figure from chinese folklore ) , i've been told to suggest the \" once upon a time in china \" series starring jet li ( though i haven't personally seen any of them yet ) . \nif you choose to watch \" drunken master \" , i really hope you enjoy it , and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema that's out there . \nall in all , i give this film an . \n", "well , i know that stallone is 50 years old now , but in daylight he doesn't look it ! \ndaylight is a great disaster movie . \nif you've seen cliffhanger , you'll know stallone's character

film . \nbut more frequently , we get films that don't much deal with it at all . \nthere is one question to ask in this case : does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies ? \nthe \" terminator \" films made up for them with exciting action , \" back to the future \" did it with an entertaining story , and the new film \" frequency \" pulls off the trick

father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in '69 and that john has found in the present day . \nthough both are initially skeptical of the idea , john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire , and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom . \nnow flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive , john is initially overjoyed , until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous : a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women . \nfrank and john now must work together to set things right , with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past . \nthe premise of \" frequency \" is unusual , and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept : john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions . \nthis isn't explained ; you just have to go with it . \nwhen frank doesn't die in a fire , john is the only one who remembers it differently , while everyone else remembers it the new way . \nthe concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities -- 1969 and 1999 -- are to each other . \nsometimes frank's changing the past results in something happening right away in john's world , and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time . \nnow , the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this , and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted ( but nevertheless logical ) if i thought about it hard enough ( for example , the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer's murders was because the change had already happened in frank's world , and john is only witnessing the * projection * of that change ) , but explanations aren't really the point . \nwhen \" frequency \" gets cooking , it's a riveting little thriller , even if it is confusing . \nwhat matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment , and \" frequency \" works as long as it keeps moving . \nthe film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion . \ndirector gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure \" frequency \" as good hollywood entertainment , establishing decent , likable characters , making us care for them , and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved . \ni liked many of the creative touches : the split screens , allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities , and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward . \nit actually uses the 1969 mets-orioles world series ( the one that featured the amazin' mets ) to great effect -- frank uses john's advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him . \n ( admittedly , this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself . ) \ni even liked the final scene , which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods . \nsome may find this scene blindingly confusing , as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious , but it does make sense if you think about it ( and give the script a lot of leeway ) , and let's face it : it's a darn cool way to end the film . \nthere are enough surprises and plot twists in \" frequency \" to keep you on your toes , and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant . \nthe other major thing to appreciate about \" frequency \" is the handling of the father-son relationship . \nquaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily ; it's a rock-solid job from both actors . \nthe relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept : how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative , or with a future descendant ? \nwatching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question . \nthe credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film ; if we don't believe in the characters , we don't care about the outcome of the thriller plot . \nhere , we do care , because we like the lead actors . \ni also liked some of the supporting cast members . \nelizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles , playing julia the doting wife * and * mother , but still performs admirably . \nandre braugher , late of the television show \" homicide : life on the street , \" gives a nice supporting turn as frank's best friend and future colleague of john . \nhe has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while frank's world series predictions come true before his very eyes . \nbraugher strikes the perfect facial expression here , simultaneously dismayed and amused . \nperhaps the only thing i didn't like about \" frequency \" is the overly sentimental coda , during which the camera's focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard . \nbut that's only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics . \ni freely acknowledge that \" frequency \" may best work as a \" guy \" movie , since it focuses on the very male-oriented idea of father-son relationships ( echoes of \" field of dreams \" can be easily heard ) , but the underlying concept is universally applicable . \nwho wouldn't want to speak with a long-dead parent ? \nor see how their children turn out ? \n \" tell me about your life , son \" -- excuse me while i mist up . \nand don't call me a sissy . \n", "blade is the movie that shows that wesley snipes really can live up to his potential as one of hollywood's premier leading men . \nblade is based on the comic book character of the same name and has that comic book kind of feel to it . \nit is a very stylish movie and for the most part that style works very well . \nalthough , at a few points i thought i was watching a music video as opposed to a movie . \nthe ideas behind blade are good , as is the basic plot of the story . \nbut at times , things seem to get a bit muddled , and the writers appear to want to do too many things at once . \nthat really doesn't take away from the story too much , but it does hurt it a little bit . \nblade ( snipes ) is half man , half vampire . \nhis mother was bitten by a vampire when she was pregnant with him and as a result he has many of the classic traits of a vampire . \nincluding a thirst for human blood that must be kept under control by a special serum which quenches his blood lust . \nblade has spent his life hunting down and killing vampires as a sort of revenge for the fact that one of their kind killed his mother . \nbut this isn't as easy as it seems , because the vampires in blade's world are more sophisticated than the ones that you find in most films . \nthe government and other authorities know of the existence of vampires , but they let them feast of the population at large because they are taking bribes from the vampires . \nwhere do vampires get money ? \nwell , in blade , they run multinational companies in order to finance their vampire organizations . \ni personally thought that this whole secret corporate world run by vampires to be a very clever idea , and a great addition to the movie . \nblade runs up against the evil deacon frost ( stephen dorff ) a maverick in the vampire community . \nhe isn't content to live among humans , and is convinced that the vampire race is the superior one and he means to insure its superiority . \nhe has managed to translate the ancient vampire scrolls that tell of the method of making him an all-powerful vampire -- rendering him virtually unstoppable . \nit's up to blade to see that this doesn't transpire . \nadmittedly , blade is style over substance through and through . \nthe story is a relatively forgettable one , but it is fun none the less . \nthe acting in blade is just about what you would expect from a movie of this type . \nthis isn't a film that is going to win accolades for its performances , and the actors know this . \nthe movie is played for fun and nobody seems to think otherwise . \nit's a popcorn movie , and no one involved has any illusions otherwise . \nblade's production values are as slick as any that you will find in your typical summer blockbuster . \nthe combat sequences between blade and his vampire targets are incredibly well done . \nalthough , the mtv-style cuts did get on my nerves after a while during long sequences . \nblade is a fun movie with an interesting take on the vampire genre . \nthis is not the movie for those of you who like your vampires in tuxedos and living in coffins in the basement of some gothic castle . \nwhat blade excels at is bringing the classic lore of the vampire into the next century with a fresh outlook on life . \nvery cool . \n", "the truman show ( paramount pictures ) running time : 1 hour 42 minutes starring jim carrey and ed harris directed by peter weir after a long wait , jim carrey's dramatic debut finally makes it to the big screen . \nin case you've been asleep for the last few months , the plot centres on truman burbank ( carrey ) who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the beautiful town of seahaven . \nhis life seems so perfect , however , because it's controlled by christoff ( harris ) creator of the truman show , the program burbank is unwittingly the hero of . \nthat's right , burbank's life is being broadcast live to the american public , and seahaven and all it's inhabitants are inclosed in a massive sound stage . \nthe film takes the jerry springer format one step too far . . . \nwith an idea so different , it would be easy for the director and screenwriter to dumb it down and appeal to the lowest common denominator . \nluckily , the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages , yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie . \ntalking of carrey , he's perfect in this movie , enjoying the best role in his career . \nhis character is a re-inforced stanley ipkiss from the mask ( 1994 ) and is completely suited to carrey's persona . \nhe occasionally falls into ace ventura mode , shrieking and being silly , but generally the audience is watching subdued carrey . \nhe's not completely dramatic like the film promises , however . \ned harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff , the megalomaniac creator of the show . \nquiet and well spoken , he burns an image into the viewer . \nunfortunately , he's barely in the film , and for the first hour dosen't appear at all ! \nalso disappointing is natascha mcelhone's character sylvia . \nshe plays the role well , but her character is sadly underwritten and is pushed to the sidelines just when the audience is used to her . \nthe supporting cast is excellent , and the town of seahaven looks delightfully perfect , so perfect it's creepy . \nthe philip glass soundtrack is also superb , and is used to great effect during the film . \npeter weir keeps the film going , clearly having fun . \nthe film is far more upbeat than his previous films dead poets society and green card . \nalthough it is slightly slow to begin with , about half an hour into film the pace really picks up , and when christoff is introduced fully the film is on a roll . \nsadly , though , the film is practically over when the film is in full steam . \nalso , concerning the ending , it is slightly too ambiguous , which was disappointing . \nthe screenwriter , andrew niccol , who bought us gattaca ( 1997 ) delivers an entertaining script , and manages to keep the plot in trim . \nwhile christoff's plans to keep truman in do get increasingly silly , they never go over the line , which would have been easy for niccol to do . \nalso , there's some funny gags involving product placement and the people who watch the show . \noverall , the truman show is excellent entertainment . \ncertainly different from the usual crap hollywood produces , it should be viewed by everyone . \nit offers something to every member of the audience , and you would almost certainly not come out disappointed . \noverall rating= \nreview by david wilcock ? 1998 \n \" you know , for kids \" - norville barnes \n", "no film in recent has left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordan's harrowing , humorous , horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabe's novel about young lad francie brady's ( eamonn owens ) descent into madness in 1960s ireland . \non one hand , it was difficult for me to become invested in francie's story because he is such an unsavory character , unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs . nugent ( fiona shaw ) . \non another hand , i found it difficult to laugh at some of francie's darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick , needy child , having been raised by a drunken father ( stephen rea ) and a suicidal mother ( aisling o'sullivan ) . \non yet another hand , i also found it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes because some of his , for lack of a better word , \" bad \" deeds are so incredibly shocking in their brutality and the malicious glee in which he performs them . \nhowever , the butcher boy's power is undeniable , and the film as a whole is unforgettable--perhaps because it is so disturbing . \nwhat makes it so unsettling is the francie's overall wink-wink yet matter-of-fact attitude about everything , expressed in a cheeky voiceover narration delivered by the adult francie ( rea again ) . \nthink heavenly creatures played largely for laughs , and you'll sort of understand . \nanchoring the whole film is the astonishing debut performance of owens ; love francie or hate him , you cannot take your eyes off of owens . \nthe butcher boy truly is a twisted , unusual film that is bound to make just about anyone uncomfortable . \nin the lobby after the screening , i overheard one man raving about how great yet disturbing it was ; i also heard one particularly offended woman say with disgust , \" that movie was so unfunny ! \" \n \" i didn't know what to expect . \nit's like something you chase for so long ,

other partner to strip to his boxer shorts and then further asks him to run out into the middle of the road , flapping his arms while feverishly cackling like a chicken just to create a distraction , his partner actually does it ! \nthe familiar lethal weapon family is back , including rene russo , who is now the expectant mother of riggs' child and joe pesci as the soprana-like , foul-mouthed former accountant who has decided to become a private eye . \nnew to the team is chris rock , also a fast-talking , up and coming detective . \ntrouble seems to follow the two veteran detectives where ever they go , and in this film , that is no exception . \neven when they are just taking a leisurely boat ride , they somehow manage to collide with a freighter ship . \nwe here some ominous music , which clues us that a confrontation is about to happen . \ngunfire ensues , and when it's all over , the detectives want to learn more about this freighter by questioning a chinatown crime lord . \nalthough they don't know what they're looking for , their inquisitiveness causes the bad guys to take some action . \nand there's plenty of action here for two movies . \nled by fighting sensation

just to make a point , and develops enormous disdain for the two detectives . \nthere are terrific car chases , explosions and gunshot galore . \nit's a summer action recipe followed to the letter , and the result is nothing less than pure , unadulterated summer fun . \nbut even too many explosions can get boring . \nto counter that , we are treated to several amazingly choreographed fight sequences with jet li . \nluckily , he'd rather fight hand-to-hand instead of firing off guns . \nmeanwhile , when the detectives aren't reloading their guns or running from fireballs , they're engaged in sophomoric banter and silly conversations that provide a nice diversion from the hail of bullets . \neverybody gets in on the shtick . \nrusso screams during her delivery , the crime lord has a few funny bits when he's being interrogated while being given laughing gas , and pesci and rock are very funny as they go at it discussing the drawbacks of having cellular phones . \ngibson and glover are always in sync and the film moves at a brisk pace to get to the final and terrific mano a mano . \nscore one for the old guard . \n", "since 1990 , the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style . \nnow , instead of emphasizing feel-good stories replete with characters of noble virtues , the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow . \nthis realist tendancy can be inspiring at times , as 1993's schindler's list shows . \nmost of today's mainstream drama , however , creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience . \nthat's why pictures like october sky , which are a throwback to the good ol' dramas of yesteryear , are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema . \nthe movie is based on the true story of homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal ) , a teenager in the 1950's company town of coalwood , west virginia . \nit's a well-known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships ; the rest grow up to work in the coal mine . \nthe mine , which is run by homer's father ( chris cooper ) , is not the place for homer , however . \nafter watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957 , homer feels a connection with the outside world -- as he puts it , \" anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did . \" \ndrafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast , homer begins to construct rockets . \nwith the help of their history teacher , miss riley ( laura dern ) , and several mine workers , the four are soon bound for great things . \noctober sky is a skillfully crafted film , and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston . \njohnston -- whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well-known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars -- certainly knows what he's doing here . \nhe molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust . \nhe does not push any barriers , but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the film's charm . \nhis finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost -- such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers , or the silent struggle between homer's mother and father . \nthe cast is well chosen , although the true bright spots are the supporting roles . \nlaura dern ( jurassic park ) lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher , giving the boys the support and guidance they need . \nher role is instantly likeable . \nchris cooper ( the horse whisperer ) , as homer's father , is less likeable -- even downright despicable at times -- but his turn here gives gravity to the movie . \nhe's definitely a driving force in homer's life , and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable . \nthe script is generally cheerful , projecting the boys' endeavors in a lighthearted manner . \nthere are moments when it becomes predictable -- such as the train tracks scene -- and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist . \nit highlights the essence of youth , however , and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps . \noctober sky should be a success with audiences . \nalthough it doesn't have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or she's all that , it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards . \nit's a welcome change to the dramatic genre , and one that everyone should see . \n", "a big surprise to me . \nthe good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off , but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues ( john belushi ) is such a dumb idea i really had no hope . \nthey replaced him just fine . \nnot with john goodman , he didn't do much of anything , but with the brilliant actor joe morton , who can really sing . \nthe fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant , who's ten . \nthis was another of my fears for the film , but he's a really good dancer , and plays a mean harmonica ( although he may have been dubbed ) . \nthings that intellectually had bothered me before , like no mission from god , everyone being richer , it not being filmed in chicago -- gave me no problems at all . \ni'm quite pleased that there were less car pile-ups , because they meant less music , and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing . \nthere's a few early crashes , and then one huge pile-up , but after that it all stops . \nit's just the music . \none of my problems with the first is that cab calloway's song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him , but there's no problems with this . \nthe music is all as good as ever , tons of great musicians showing up -- with the

exactly is an old-fashioned hollywood romance ? \nwhat made \" return to me \" old-fashioned and old-hollywood ? \nwas it the tunes from sinatra , etc . , legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on ? \nwas it the glamorous , sophisticated feel ? \nthe charisma of the two leads ? \neven now i can't say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer , because i haven't see that many old-fashioned hollywood romances . \ni don't think any of the romances i've seen have been classified as such . \nwhich leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics -- \" return to me \" was old-fashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic , the way i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider . \nit was traditional , magical . \nwe knew it couldn't be too daring , or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in . \nit was a romance told with such endearing simplicity , tenderness , and love ( from director bonnie hunt ) that it couldn't help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings . \nthe film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunt's direction . \nfrom the very first bird's eye view of chicago , zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland ( david duchovny ) , accompanied by the \" return to me \" ballad ( by whom ? ) , we can tell we're in for something sweet . \nthe scenes between the characters are endearing , truthful , with just a hint of fantasy . \nreal people don't act that way ; real people aren't that nice . \nwe know all this , and yet we want to believe in these folks' existence . \nthe premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale , but hunt's rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of the ethereal . \neverything is ordinary--yet beautiful--in this film . \n>from the festive little family restaurant to grace ( minnie driver ) and bob's wardrobes . \nfrom the eloquent , not-in-a-hurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints . \nfrom the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen -- the most beautiful part . \n \" return to me \" has done an excellent job of assembling together a group of actors who blend in effortlessly as a family : the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family actually does exist . \nwe care for them , laugh with them , cry with them ; we're concerned that the little boy will pick up cursing from his father . \nwhatever hunt did , she brought out the naturalism in all of the actors . \ndisappointingly , david alan grier's charlie , however much i like him , was the most flatly-written . \nduchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona -- with the help of his fellow co-stars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder . \ninstead we have a normal guy who when he falls in love shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of \" the x-files . \" \nduchovny , who is excellent at understatement and self-deprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent on screen . \nminnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet , innocent grace with nothing but a good heart to offer . \nthough an unlikely pair , duchovny and driver gradually warm up to each other as the movie progresses . \nwhile \" return to me \" functions remarkably as a laugh-out-loud comedy , a romantic scenic tour through chicago , and a tearjerker , the story is set up so the film ends up having nowhere to develop . \nthe entire climax of the film hinges on when and how grace is going to tell bob that she actually was the recipient of his wife's heart . \nwe already know that there's going to be a happy ending ; we feel like we spend the entire film , however enjoyably , in a straight line going towards that point . \nas a result bob and grace click almost too quickly--yes , i know she's supposed to have his ex-wife's heart and everything--it seems too effortless . \nthe main subject is a love story , and the family scenes i love so much unfortunately are overused and distract from the turmoil of the two main characters ( whose story might not have that much meat after all ) . \nhowever , in the spirit of \" return to me , \" it won't do to be too picky about how \" old \" hollywood tells its stories . \ni loved knowing that this was a labor of love for bonnie hunt . \nit shows . \nthe bottom line : \" return to me \" is nothing remarkable , and yet its sweetness , sincerity , and charm might touch your heart in ways that you hadn't imagined . \n", "wild things is a suspenseful thriller starring matt dillon , denise richards , and neve campbell that deals with all the issues ; sex , love , murder , and betrayal . \nthe setting of the film is a town named blue bay . \nit consists of many swamps and slums and , on the other hand , rich estates owned by the town's different benefactors . \nthe film opens just before the beginning of a senior seminar at the town's ritzy , expensive high school . \nit is here that we meet all of the core characters . \nthere's guidance counselor sam lombardo , police officers ray duquette and gloria perez , dark mysterious senior suzie toller , and the popular head cheerleader kelly van ryan . \nwe first see that all of the senior girls are smitten with the handsome guidance counselor , but none more than kelly . \nthroughout the first portion of the film we see how far kelly will go to get sam until she accuses him of rape . \nshortly after , suzie , too , confesses that sam raped her as well . \nthis pushes kelly's sex craving mother , sandra , to stop at nothing until sam is convicted . \nduring the trial , kelly gives a teary confession of how sam raped her . \nhowever , it is later revealed by suzie that sam never raped either of the girls , it was all a vengeful plan against the guidance counselor . \nafter sam is cleared , kelly's mother pays sam a very substantial amount of cash in order for him not to sue her . \nit is then revealed that sam , kelly , and suzie were all in on it together . \nit is here that the film starts to reveal just who is being honest with each other and who has their own hidden agenda . \nmatt dillon stars as sam lombardo . \nsam is the kind of guy that every woman would like to sink their claws into , and sam obviously knows it and uses it to his own advantage . \nhe isn't the obvious best of actors , but dillon does give a convincing performance . \nhowever , his talents seem to be rendered useless near the end of the film , making it look as though his character has lost all of his ethics and principles , although he never had many to start out with in the first place . \nneve campbell , who most people relate to scream and scream 2 , plays blue bay outcast suzie toller . \nsuzie obviously has some serious issues to deal with which are obvious from her first scene in the film . \ncampbell is very successful with this character , adding the slightest bit of charm to a seemingly repulsive character and making her fun to watch . \nplaying kelly van ryan is denise richards . \nkelly is your typical , rich , sexy , head cheerleader who thinks she can have any man she choses , like her sexpot mother sandra . \none of the most interesting things about this film is how it compares and contrasts the relationship between kelly and her mother . \ndenise richards , still hot off the press from starship troopers , gives the most interesting performance in the entire film . \nin the beginning , kelly looks to be a paper thin character , but richards adds a little more spice and ultimately makes the character not only sexy , but dominating as well . \nkevin bacon gives one of his fair performances as ray duquette . \nthis character looks to be one of the most boring , predictable in the film . \nhowever , it is a relationship revealed between him and suzie that adds depth to his story . \nstill , the film doesn't seem to gain much from bacon's performance , only his name . \nin the supporting cast , theresa russell plays the much oversexed sandra van ryan , daphne rubin-vega gives an unappealing performance as cop gloria perez , and bill murray shines as sam's lawyer , ken bowden . \nhats off to murray for adding the perfect touch of comedy to the film . \nalthough wild things was displayed by the press as being an erotic thriller , the eroticism , which is portrayed with good taste , is kept to a minimum and focuses more on the plot and the relationships between the characters . \nthis is truly a very good film worth seeing if your looking for a movie with a thick plot filled with it's share of twists . \n", " * * * * * * minor plot spoilers in review * * * * * * * * * * * * no

are returning home after battling and beating the aliens . \nthe climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item , an egg . \nin the opening

is more in alien 3 than either of the earlier two . \nit also sports a new alien with 4 legs ! \ni won't say how , but it leads us to believe a few new things about the alien and its cycle , which i am sure will be explored in alien 4 . \nsigourney weaver is back as ripley and provides another excellent performance of this character . \nher scene during the autopsy of newt is enough to garnish her another academy nomination . \nthe rest of the cast is also quite good . \nnotably , charles dance as the doctor with whom ripley finds momentary escape from fury 109 . \nalien 3 has a very distinct look . \nthis is due largely to its director , david fincher . \nmr . fincher , who until now has only directed music videos and commercials , has done an incredible job here . \nhis direction is excellent and makes this film come to life in ways no \" alien \" film has before . \nfor mr . fincher , i see a long prosperous career ahead of him . \nthe music was also done by a newcomer to the film industry . \nelliot goldenthal has created a deeply moving score which lends itself to the claustrophobic setting that the \" alien \" series been set in . \nthis time the score is not so much a rip off of star trek ii ( james horner's aliens ) . \nthis score has a choral back up at times and even lends itself to the old style of ennio morricone scoring . \nthis is a great score . \nthe ending to alien 3 is quite good . \nthere were times i thought that hollywood would come in and screw it up , but it played very nicely . \ni will not ruin the ending for you . \ngo see the film . \ni consider it to be a much more involved film than any of the other films released so far this season . \nalien 3 is a worthy successor to aliens and alien . \nand when they make alien 4 , perhaps they will be able to find yet another new direction to take it in . \n", "are you tired of all the hot new releases being gone by the time you get to the video store ? \nwafflemovies . com is dedicated to finding those hidden gems that lie on the shelves . \neveryweek , wafflemovies . com \nreviews independent film and big studio pictures that deserve a second chance on video . \nhere is a sample review : \nwelcome to sarajevo \nin light of america's recent intervention in kosovo , welcome to sarajevo is a reminder of the horror america and the world ignored for years . \nset in sarajevo 1992 and based on actual events , this picture examines the human and societal casualties of war . \nthe picture opens with a family escorting their young bride to her wedding . \nas they make their way down the street , a sniper shoots the mother of the bride . \nyet another reminder that daily life in war torn sarajevo can never escape the horror of war . \nin this scene , we meet joe flynn ( woody harrelson ) , an american reporter who stops reporting to help a priest carry the mortally wounded mother into a church . \njoe is cocky , but also good at heart as he continues to carry out kind deeds for people he doesn't even know . \nhis fellow reporter is the british michael henderson ( stephen dillane ) . \nmichael is quickly growing tired of the horror that surrounds him and the world's lack of interest . \nhenderson is haunted by the memory of an altar boy who witnesses the mother's death as well as a young girl who he finds orphaned in a hospital after a mortar attack on citizens waiting in line for bread . \nhe decides to take action when a united nations' delegation descends upon the area to declare yugoslavia the fourteenth most dangerous place on earth . \nhenderson begins a series profiling an orphanage located on the front lines . \nhe finds children of all ages living in fear and taking care of each other with the help of one adult . \nduring his visits , he befriends a pre-teen girl , emira ( emira nuseric ) who serves as surrogate mother to baby roadrunner . \nhe promises to get emira out of harm's way if he gets the chance . \nafter the un delegation leaves the country without rescuing any of the children , henderson loses hope . \nhowever , his reporting has grabbed the attention of nina ( marisa tomei ) and her children's aid group that helps to find homes for the yugoslavian orphans . \nunfortunately , only babies are wanted for adoption , so henderson pledges to take emira to england . \nthe group of children , nina and henderson depart the front lines on a dangerous escape for italy . \ncan they complete this dangerous trek through the war torn countryside and avoid hostile troops gathering up muslims for concentration camps ? \nthe movie was beautifully and sensitively made . \ndirector michael winterbottom and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce vividly express the societal destruction that has occurred . \nthey show the destroyed lives , families that have been split up , and the desolation that everyone attempts to cope with . \nthis is best exemplified by the group of yugoslavians henderson , his producer and flynn have befriended . \nthe group of twenty-somethings reside in a bombed out bar without life's simplest pleasures and amenities . \none of them is an accomplished musician who spends his days playing the piano and promising to play a concert when sarajevo is declared the most dangerous place on earth . \nlike the rest of those deeply effected by the war , this small group tries to survive instead of trying to live . \nwinterbottom brilliantly intersplices scenes with actual news footage to give the film the feel of a documentary and keeps the viewer aware that many of these horrors are being carried out thousands of miles away as you sit safely in your living room . \nthe picture is also bolstered by beautiful cinematography that captures the devastation of this city that hosted the 1984 olympics . \nwinterbottom and boyce also produce a realistic portrayal of the reporters covering the atrocities . \nthis portrayal is much more flattering to reporters than earlier wafflemovies . com \nselection mad city . \nwe watch them struggle to cover the horror , while trying to remain professionally detached . \nhowever , they are human and question the reason behind it all , why no one cares , and how they can get out . \nstephen dillane is wonderful as henderson . \nhe portrays the character as an everyman caught in the middle of extraordinary events . \ndillane avoids making the character overly heroic and preachy . \nhenderson realizes that he cannot save the world , but he can help a few . \nit is a wonderful opportunity for dillane after he had to suffer through the denis leary-sandra bullock disaster two if by sea . \nwoody harrelson continues to prove that he is one of the finest , most versatile actors of his generation . \nharrelson plays the cocky celebrity reporter with a heart of gold by allowing the character's caring nature and vulnerability shine through . \nharrelson is equally adept at taking on roles as zany leading men ( cheers , white men can't jump ) as well as excellent supporting roles such as this one . \nthis ability will serve him well and give him a long , successful career . \namerica's involvement in this struggle comes seven years after the events of the movie take place . \nfor those who do not have a full understanding of the history of the conflict , the entire movie , most importantly the opening scenes , provide a history lesson . \nwar is a foreign concept to most of us in america . \nbattles are fought thousands of miles away among people we have no attachment to . \ntelevised images of the gulf war are all the experience most of us have with war . \nthis picture brings it right into your living room and makes you think outside of our own small world , something we don't do enough of in 90's america . \n", "many people dislike french films for their lack of closure . \nwhile possibly shallow , i've often had a desire for a sense of epiphany , or at least a resolution , in the films which i view . \nthere is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional ; however , the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion-denying protagonist , stephane ( daniel auteuil ) . \nstephane ( daniel auteuil ) is a master violin maker . \nhe is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing . \neven the relationship between he and his boss , maxime ( andre dussollier ) is a controlled , and almost manipulated association , highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches . \nin the beginning of the movie , stephane is a closed , solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man . \ncamille kessler ( emmanuelle beart ) is a master violinist and the new love of maximes . \nmaxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife . \nlike stephane , camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved , sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges . \nwhen stephane and camille meet , there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals . \nhowever , whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane , stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him . \nstephane ignores his feelings for camille , which the audience cannot help but to see is present . \nas the movie progresses , the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another . \nthese two people , with very similar approaches to life initially , react to their new circumstance very differently . \nstephane becomes even more rational and controlled , while camille becomes more tempestuous , until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship . \nhowever , their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation . \nthe audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well , due to his relationship with a master violin teacher . \nhowever , apparently , he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing . \nconsequently , stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays . \nin contrast , camille had almost given the violin , years earlier . \nhowever , with the aid of her manager , she has progressed to being almost one of the world's finest , successfully submerging herself to her playing . \nduring the course of the movie , we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions . \nstephane attempts to remain unchanged . \nhowever , we do see subtle hints of his transformation . \none of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash . \nthe development of all of the characters , many of which is not included in this synopsis , is incredible . \namerican movies , with rare exceptions , have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development . \nin its essence , this movie is about the development and growth of the characters , camille and stephane . \nthe portrayal of all the other characters in the movie , including a death , is to further the development of camille's and stepahne's characters . \ni am not sure why berardinelli says , \" at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified , and it is to auteuil's credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty . \" \nthis movie is not about judging stephane's actions as being right or wrong , but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are . \ni find the ending appropriate ; unfortunately , i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling . \nthis portion of the film is where the \" sense of closure \" could have been successfully accomplished . \nunfortunately , there is a hurried and almost a soap opera-type surge of emotions from all of the characters . \nwhile ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart , ravel has his day in this film . \nthe synergism of the tension of ravel's music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen . \nthe directing in this movie is wonderful . \nthe actors and actresses are excellent , each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth . \nemmanuelle beart's personality is beautiful . \nand needless to say , i must say that emmanuelle beart , herself , is beautiful . \nbesides the near ending , the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral . \ni almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of . \nthe one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot , has their attitude towards love changed ? \ni have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at , but i am unsure of which the director is espousing . \nin summary , this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship . \nin the process , we see their attitude towards life and other people . \nin itself , i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie . \nwhere it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we , as americans , have preconceived american notions of relationship , love , and people . \ni do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture . \nhowever , i , bringing my american preconceptions , enjoyed the film . \ni would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it . \n", "the keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber , the naive ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse , and a partnership that blossoms between the two are the fine components that make up a modest , little caper adventure entitled `where the money is . ' \nthe elderly bank robber is henry ( paul newman ) , a famous criminal that was only recently caught . \nhe has pulled off dozens of successful heists and has probably stashed away a small fortune . \nalways the shrewd thinker , he begins working on a plan to get out of jail . \nthis involves years of studying buddhism and self-hypnosis . \nwhen he is prepared to execute his plan , he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke . \nnow a seemingly twitching vegetable , he is temporarily transferred to a state-run home . \ncarol ( linda fiorentino ) is the nurse that cares for him . \nshe's a very bright person with a good heart . \nyet , her life is a miserable waste of time . \nthe most exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars . \nher days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calisthenics . \nworse , she's in a dead-end relationship with high-school sweetheart wayne ( dylan mcdermott ) . \nthey became a couple because they were king and queen of the prom . \nto her , this made sense long ago . \nbut now , it's a different story . \nwayne seems equally bored with his life , but is content enough to stay put . \nwayne's greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman . \ncarol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients , but she's never been anywhere else and doesn't see many other opportunities in life . \nhowever , when henry falls under her care , her outlook begins to change . \nthe medical reports may state that he suffered a massive stroke . \ncarol , however , begins to grow suspicious that henry may just be faking it after all . \nmaybe she can get through to him , and maybe she can learn something about the money that he has stashed away . \nthe opening 30 minutes are filled with hilarious attempts of carol trying to bring henry ? back to life . ' \nand what are some of carol's resuscitation techniques ? \nperhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses . \nif that fails , maybe she'll try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a 20-foot high pier into the cold lake below . \nwhen he finally comes out of his state of self-trance , the movie's direction changes , though it remains equally if not more entertaining . \ncarol sees that henry is filled with charisma and self-assuredness . \nshe is invigorated by his commanding presence and refreshed by his vibrancy . \nthis , of course , puts wayne in an odd situation . \nhenry and carol's bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car . \nhenry needs this heist because he is unable to retrieve his original stash . \nmeanwhile , this is carol's ticket to a better life . \nwayne is uncomfortable with the situation , but helps out nonetheless . \nhowever , his lack of commitment threatens their success . \nthe heist sequence is suspenseful , well paced , and casts the uneasy feeling that something will horribly go wrong . \n`where the money is' does more to spotlight newman and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist . \nnewman is the real joy of the film , adroitly showing that at age 75 , he's still really hot stuff . \nhe possesses a sly smile , displays a dominating attitude , and a projects a demeanor that is undeniably attractive . \nfiorentino is also a fun presence . \nyou root for her despite her sense of amorality . \nsure , she wants to commit robbery and has little compunction about pushing a wheelchair-stricken man into a lake , but we can see that to escape her dead-end world , she needs to do something drastic . \nwith two charismatic characters such as these , it's hard to ignore that `where the money is' is where the fun is . \n", "robert benton has assembled a stellar , mature cast for his latest feature , twilight , a film noir mystery set amid the fading stars of hollywood . \npaul newman stars as retired detective harry ross . \nharry has spent the last couple of years doing odd jobs for jack and catherine ames ( gene hackman and susan sarandon ) , a pair of married actors who have fallen from the limelight . \nwhen jack sends him on a routine delivery job , however , the old instincts kick in . \nsoon , harry is wading through a mystery where friendships and lives are on the line , and he no longer knows who to trust . \nthere are plenty of familiar faces throughout twilight , in addition to newman , hackman and sarandon . \njames garner plays raymond hope , a former cop and one of harry's best friends . \nstockard channing plays verna , harry's former partner , and possibly a former love interest . \nreese witherspoon is mel , the distrustful daughter of the ames' , and liev schrieber is her scuzzy boyfriend . \ngiancarlo esposito appears as harry's bumbling detective protigi , and john spencer is a suspicious police captain . \nwith a cast like that , it's almost worth watching twilight just to stargaze . \nluckily , there's more to the film than some sort of actor's recognition ceremony . \ntwilight has a solid film noir-ish plot . \nit may not have as many twists and turns as some of the classics , but it has much more than a lot of what passes for film these days . \nthe major cast members all deliver strong performances , as can be expected of their caliber . \nhowever , none of them have that little extra oomph which would make them memorable . \nthe supporting cast is enjoyable , if a little underdrawn . \nstockard channing's character , in particular , is a cipher . \nthere's more to her character than the film takes the time to describe . \nit's a minor , but irritating , flaw . \nwith a solid cast , and a good plot , there's a lot to recommend about twilight . \nit's biggest flaw is actually its short running time . \nat a slim 94 minutes , there's a lot of stuff that's packed into an awfully small package . \nstill , the chance to see newman , sarandon and hackman working together is worth a cramp or two . \n", "warning : anyone offended by blatant , leering machismo had better avoid this film . \nor lots of blood & guts , men against men and mano-et-mano stuff . \nin other words , it's a walter hill film ! \nwith a john milius script ! \ni always picture these guys getting together and producing a movie between arm-wrestling matches . \nthese films always contain male characters i have a very hard time identifying with , probably due to the likelihood that any meeting between them and me would result in my arm being ripped off and then my subsequent death by beating with said limb . \nand we got tough guys galore , here ; drug-running banditos by the dozens , all dirty and sweaty and pretty ill-tempered , overall ; a secret task force of army commandos who are in the area to cover-up ( supposedly ) any connection between the government and the drug runners ; and lots of shit-kicking texas dirt farmers who'd as soon shoot you between the eyes as look at you . \nin particular , we got nick nolte as one hard-ass texas ranger , powers boothe as the drug kingpin , michael ironsides as the leader of the secret army , and rip torn as the local sheriff . \ntorn is the sympathetic figure of the group ; he smiles before shooting anyone . \nas to women . . . \nwell , i've never seen jane fonda or meryl streep in a walter hill film , and at this rate , i doubt i ever will . \nwomen exist here to look good , comfort the man , and get argued over . \ngosh ! \njust like the old days . . . \nfrankly , this is a pretty good movie , if you can accept the premise and can take the macho stuff . \nthe cinematography is excellent , the cast of characters is broad and has texture , the script is quite good , and the film lets you keep up with what's happening yourself , without spelling it out to you . \ni appreciate a film that makes me have to think to keep up . \nfinally , there's lots of sam peckinpah slow-motion shoot-ups . \n", "accepting his oscar as producer of this year's best picture winner , saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over . \none could almost say the same about his much-prized film . \nrarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery , symbolism , ideas and metaphors , complex and literate storytelling , all possessed of an intelligence that invites -- even demands -- constant scrutiny , an acuity of perception and observation that must somehow yield the truth . \nin short , the antithesis of all things hollywood . \nyet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind . \nralph fiennes is the title character , an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory , and particularly the memory of love , is the ostensible focus of the film . \nbut despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together , we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him . \nhis emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld . \nthe same can easily be said for every other character in the film , of which there are too many . \njuliette binoche's nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart . \nat least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her , and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious , disfigured , dying stranger . \neven this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion , however , that it verges on the comical . \nwith so many characters enjoying so little screen time , the film's 160 minutes can be taxing . \nyet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i couldn't help but feel that greatness was in the air . \nhints of it were everywhere -- in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover ; in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern-day swimmer in the sahara ; in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war . \nthere is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years . \nbut ultimately the emotional truths writer-director anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed . \nin the end , i was left with the impression that i had witnessed quite an oxymoron : a haunting bore . \nbore is perhaps too strong a word . \nbut after drinking in the rich production values , the cup remains only slightly over half-full . \n", "a bleak look at how the boston underworld operates , a film which was based on the best-seller by george v . , higgins . \nit is seen through the weary eyes of a 51-year-old , small-time hood , eddie \" fingers \" coyle ( mitchum ) . \nhe got the nickname when a mob boss in his underworld element shut the draw on his hand as a punishment . \nhis current dilemma is that he got caught running illegal booze by truck and faces a 3-5 year stretch in new hampshire , something he feels will be a life sentence for him since he doesn't think he could survive prison at his age . \nhe is also concerned that his wife and three kids will have to go on welfare . \nhe could have cut a deal and gotten off , if he turned his boss over to the d . a . , but he figured he would never live if he did that . \nhe is currently gun-running for a gang of very successful bank robbers led by scalise ( rocco ) . \nthe masked bank robbers operate by always first going to the bank manager's house and holding his family hostage and then they go to the bank and force the manager to open the vault for them or else his family gets it . \non one of the heists , they kill a bank officer who pushes the alarm . \ncoyle's best friend is dillon ( boyle ) , a hit man for the mob , working as a bartender . \nhe is a permanent stoolie for the treasury agents , as an aggressive young agent named foley ( jordan ) , who likes to be called uncle , gives dillon breathing room to operate some of his low-level crime activities and to work the bar even though he has a prison record , as long as he keeps getting valuable info from him on things happening with the gangs . \nwith the sentencing date closing in on him , the already convicted coyle is out on bail and looking for an angle to cut his jail time . \nhe contacts agent foley and gives him a few inconsequential tips and then decides to do something that goes against his grain . \nthinking he made an iron-clad deal with foley to get his sentenced squashed in new hampshire , he gives him the place where a sale of machine guns is going down , knowing full-well the young hustler ( keats ) selling the guns is a lot like he was as a youth and when arrested will be facing a life sentence . \nbut foley tells him after he arrests the gun-dealer , that new hampshire wants more before they take away his jail sentence , they want him to be a full-time informer . \nwarning : spoiler follows in next paragraph . \nthe bank robbers are setup and caught in the act and the mob boss is convinced coyle did it and gives dillon the contract to take care of his friend . \nthe contemptuous dillon befriends coyle and treats him to a steak dinner and takes him to a bruin hockey game while getting him boozed up . \ncoyle takes a look at the young bruin star bobby orr from his upper deck seat and says , \" to be young like that and have his future , he's the greatest hockey player in the world . \" \ndillon then takes the drunken coyle for a long drive and executes him mob-style , having a kid who works for him dump the body in some bad section of boston . \nthis is a great atmospheric film due to the realistic noir mood it sets , of the hopeless situation the low-level criminals are in , and how they are forced to live with fear and the uncertainty of what horrible thing will happen next . \nthe city streets are ugly , the gangsters are shown to be capable of any action to defend their own interests , whether it is betrayal or murder . \nthere is a fatalistic feel about their lives , something robert mitchum wears as easily as others put on a hat . \nmitchum gives this film all the intensity and purpose it needs , as it overcomes a thin plot . \nit makes you see the characters for what they are without any false sympathy for them . \nmitchum is a loser ; and , that he lived so long , is a tribute to his skills as a survivor . \nbut in the end , he even loses the respect he had among his underworld friends as a standup guy , as he wrestled with his code of honor and lost even that battle . \n", " \" footloose \" has only one goal in mind : to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel-good antics . \nand i hate to admit it ; i fell for it . \nthe movie is about a teenager ( bacon ) who moves to a small town from the big city , and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend ( lithgow ) . \nhe ends up falling for the preacher's daughter ( singer ) and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do . \nas mentioned at the beginning of this review , \" footloose \" is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama . \nthere are virtually no surprises , and the writing is second-rate . \nso why did i enjoy it so much ? \nfor one thing , the cast is great . \nkevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role . \nwe're rooting for him right from the start , and , unlike most films of this genre , bacon doesn't play him as the \" rebel without a clue \" sort . \nyes , he does rebel , but he's also polite when he needs to be . \nand he never broods . \nthe rest of the cast is equally impressive . \njohn lithgow , seen here playing a normal guy for a change , is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian . \nbut lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter . \nby the end of the film , we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character . \nanother nice touch is the music . \nwe see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with \" sexual innuendos \" , but that's not true at all . \nthe title track , performed by kenny loggins , is upbeat and fun . \nduring the final sequence , i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing . \nof course , i soon realized that would be a little pathetic . \nanyway , \" footloose \" is a charming little surprise . \ndon't let the premise prevent you from watching it . \nit sucked me in , and it'll do the same to you . \n", "as i walked out of crouching tiger , hidden dragon i thought to myself that i had had just seen a great film . \nwith the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a \" great \" piece of work and viceversa . \nattempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs . \ni avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology . \nas the word implies , a masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of a master . \nas such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality . \ncrouching tiger , hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category . \ncrouching tiger , hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore , with the requisite blend of legend , fantasy , magic and mythology . \nit is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be half-gods - greater than life , purer than life , stronger than life , physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats , but with a human soul that makes them ultimately vulnerable . \nall the classic elements of the oriental mystique are thrown into the mix , including the art of contemplation and the concept of martial dexterity as the physical equivalent of spiritual advancement . \nthe classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop , with advanced masters of each and a golden pupil , which must choose between the two . \nit is the gifted pupil who , under the influence of the evil master steals the holy grail in the form of a magic sword which is the focus of the conflict at the heart of the legend . \nthe elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment ( a pair of masters and a pair of youngsters ) are poignantly represented . \nthe paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively . \nthe fight scenes are stunning balletic tours-de-force , not to be taken literally but clearly to be enjoyed as superb cinematic art , as are the prodigious leaps and flights to , from and between rooftops , the martial combat at the top of swaying bamboo branches and the combatants skipping like pebbles along the surface of a lake . \nthere need be no question of suspended disbelief when one is in the presence of poetry . \nas in a wagnerian opera there is a substantial story line , which takes place at an ordinary human level , yet the entire project is to be accepted as a work of art rooted in fantasy . \ndo not assume , however , that the art is limp-wristed . \nfor those who are put off by the \" art \" label this film can be confidently recommended as engrossing entertainment at the levels of adventure , action and romance . \nthere are no weak performances in this movie . \nmichelle yeoh imbues her character with depth , humanity and wisdom . \nchow yon fat projects dignity and purity of heart . \nzhang ziyi is a budding superstar . \nshe is radiantly beautiful and totally persuasive in a multifaceted role . \ncheng pei pei as the evil master and chang cheng as the bandit prince acquit themselves admirably . \nkudos to screenwriters james schamus , wang hui ling and tsai kuo jing , choreographer yuen wo-ping , photography director peter pau and music director tan dun , each of which contribute quality components to this extraordinary film . \nang lee as the director , co-producer and mastermind of the project gets the lion share of the credit . \nthis is destined to be one of those films that everybody likes , including those who hate martial arts movies . \ndon't miss it . \n", " \" crazy/beautiful \" suffers from the damned-if-you-do , damned-if-you-don't syndrome . \nafter a spate of flighty , cookie-cutter teen films , the romantic drama addresses alcoholism and parental loss along with its love story . \nbut rather than applaud the production , early reviews have dismissed it as an overblown \" afterschool special . \" \neven worse , in the wake of federal trade commission hearings that blasted the industry for marketing violent and sexual movies to young people , the studio got a case of the heebie-jeebies and forced director john stockwell to re-shoot scenes and cut footage to \" tone things down . \" \nneedless to say , the filmmaker was frustrated . \n \" we were

performances from its lead players and a script determined to transcend stereotypes . \n \" crazy/beautiful \" is quality fare , good enough that i half-expected the summer movie crap police to walk into the press screening and confiscate the print for \" failure to incorporate explosions and poop jokes . \" \nset in pacific palisades , calif . , the story follows the burgeoning relationship between two teens . \nevery morning and evening , carlos nunez ( jay hernandez ) takes a two-hour bus ride in order to attend pacific high school . \nan honor student and star athlete , carlos is responsible , modest and focused as he works on securing a place in the naval academy . \nall is well until he meets nicole oakley ( kirsten dunst ) , the daughter of a rich congressman ( bruce davison ) . \nnicole is a drunk apparently hell-bent on self-destruction . \ncarlos is smart enough to recognize the danger in getting involved with her , but he is only human and she has the greatest smile . \nplus , as her father notes , she has a real knack for drawing others into her downward spiral . \nas with \" save the last dance , \" \" crazy/beautiful \" ( god , how i hate lower-case titles ) takes situations that look stale on paper and makes them seem fresh . \nwhile noting the racial and social differences between the kids , the screenplay dances around most of the clich ? s ( there are still several mtv moments , though ) . \nthe filmmakers make a point to give characters that crucial extra bit of shading that turns them into individuals instead of stereotypes and the actors take it from there . \ncute-as-a-button dunst forces the viewer to share the pain beneath nicole's behavior . \nshe is credible enough that when dad urges carlos to get away from her before she drags him down , i hoped the boy would listen . \nas carlos , hernandez is a revelation . \nhunky without looking like the product of a hollywood design team , the young man can really act ; we will see a lot of this guy in the future . \naside from its title , the biggest problem with \" crazy/beautiful \" is its ending , which wraps everything up too fast and too tidy . \nafter carefully presenting credible characters and situations , the conclusion feels rushed and lazy . \nstill , this is the kind of film that deserves accolades from critics instead of cheap shots . \n \" afterschool special \" my ass ? \" crazy/beautiful \" is the real deal . \n", "everyone knows someone like giles de'ath : stuffy , arrogant , set in his ways , and at war with anything that could in any way be associated with \" progress . \" \ngiles is a writer , but the product of his typewriter is the kind of scholarly stuff that is immediately put onto library stacks where it can gather dust until some graduate student needs another reference for his or her thesis . \nhis house looks like an immaculate museum ? with no television , microwave , word processor , or other technological gadgets , only the electric lights betray that he's living in the twentieth century , not the nineteenth . \nthis is the kind of role that could easily be turned into a flat stereotype , but john hurt , in what is certainly his best performance in a decade and possibly the most impressive of his long and distinguished career , turns \" erstwhile fogy \" giles into a three-dimensional human being . \ndespite his tunnel vision , it's impossible not to like the man , especially after his entire being is transformed by that singular affliction to which no one is immune : love . \nand , as giles discovers during the course of this amusing , warm-hearted motion picture , it's possible to find the object of one's affection in the most unusual places . \ngiles , who is a widower and a recluse , does not frequent the cinema , but when he learns that an e . m . forster film is playing at the local theater , he screws up his courage and decides to go . \nwhat he doesn't realize is that the movie house is showing two films : the forster adaptation and a teen exploitation flick called hotpants college ii . \na nonplused giles ends up sitting in a darkened room watching buff male and female bodies in various states of undress . \njust as giles is about to leave , however , he notices ronnie bostock ( jason priestley ) , and , suddenly , it's love at first sight . \ngiles is enraptured , and the moment hotpants college ii is over , he beings to scour stores for bostock memorabilia , including teen magazines and video tapes . \n ( in order to watch those tapes , giles must buy a vcr , but he initially doesn't realize that he needs a tv to use the vcr . ) \neventually , not satisfied with being the world's foremost authority on bostock , giles boards a plane and travels to long island , where his idol's home is located . \nbostock is away when giles arrives , but the wily englishman manages to befriend ronnie's supermodel girlfriend , audrey ( fiona loewi ) . \neventually , the actor arrives home and , impressed with giles' demeanor and intelligence , he begins to rely on the older man's advice . \nbut , while giles' affection runs deep , ronnie's feelings are less constant . \nlove and death on long island is a comedy , and a very funny one at that . \nin fact , for its first half , the film is nearly-perfect . \nit suffers a fall-off once giles reaches new york , and the ending , with its none-too-subtle homosexual overtones , is a little too overbearing for the lighthearted material that precedes it . \nin his gently satirical approach to popular culture and movie stardom , writer/director richard kwietniowski , adapting from the novel by gilbert adair , is 100% on- target . \nin the process , he not only creates a truly likable and memorable character in giles , but says a few things about the transforming power of love , even if it is unrequited . \nfrom start to finish , this is clearly hurt's movie ? he's in almost every frame . \nit's a role that the veteran actor must have relished , because he makes giles an unforgettable motion picture figure , and does so by means of dialogue delivery , body language , and ever-changing facial expressions . \njason priestley , cashing in on his beverly hills 90210 image , is surprisingly effective as the shallow ronnie . \nhe is charismatic , and it's not hard to understand why giles is attracted to ronnie . \nmeanwhile , solid support is provided by the appealing fiona loewi and the always-reliable maury chaykin . \nlove and death on long island is many things wrapped into one : a social commentary ( it tackles the thorny issue of film as pure art versus film as mindless entertainment ) , a buddy picture/love story ( ronnie and giles have one of the most interesting relationships found anywhere on a movie screen these days ) , and a \" fish out of water \" tale ( victorian relic giles forced into the modern world ) . \nyet , despite the many laughs love and death offers , it never takes cheap shots . \nit has a vibrant , beating heart ? and that makes the comedy all the more worthwhile . \n", "for many people , procrastination isn't a

\nthat's all that really needs to be said , but nevertheless , i will provide the three of you that have seemingly been living in a cave with a plot description . \ndeath decides to take a holiday , what with all the rigors of soul-collecting and all , and forces anthony hopkins into showing him what it's like to be human . \ndeath assumes the body of brad pitt , and from there , much trouble ensues . \nfor one thing , death-as-pitt falls in love with hopkins daughter , played by claire forlani . \nobviously this enrages hopkins , because really , what can death offer ? \nbesides eternal damnation , of course . \nthere is also a sub-plot about forlani's ex-boyfriend ( she dumps him for pitt ) trying to take over hopkins company . \n \" meet joe black \" runs just under three hours . \ni've always thought that such obscene running times should be limited to historical epics . \n \" meet joe black \" is neither historical nor is it an epic , though i get the feeling martin brest ( the director ) desperately wants it to be . \nevery single scene in the movie goes on about 3-4 minutes too long . \nand the ending takes about 20 minutes longer than it really should . \na severe editing job could have made this movie excellent , instead of just good , which is what it is . \npitt , an actor i normally loathe , is actually quite engaging as death . \ni believed his performance , and i could see why forlani's character would fall in love with him . \ni have to agree with roger ebert , though , who found it hard to believe that an entity that's been around for all time wouldn't know what peanut butter was . \nthat has nothing to do with pitt's performance , of course , but it is a little distracting . \nhopkins gives his usual excellent performance . \nhe's able to portray the angst of a man who knows he has very little time left , without making him an obnoxious whiner . \nand in her first major studio role , claire forlani is surprisingly good . \nshe has a sweet tenderness that allows the audience to instantly root for her . \nso , \" meet joe black \" is a good movie hampered by it's ridiculous running time . \nhad the film been cut by an hour or so , i have no doubt that i would be calling it one of the best movies of the year in this review . \n", "call it touched by a demon . \ngregory hoblit's fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual , horrific twist . \nif marketed properly , this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim , dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven . \nin fact , there's even a little twin peaks to be found here , albeit with the lion's share of the weirdness distilled out . \n ( remember bob ? ) \nthe biggest failing of fallen is that , although it's consistently interesting , it's not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope . \na serial killer ( elias koteas ) has been on the loose in philadephia , but detective john hobbes ( denzel washington ) , the noblest man on the police force , has brought him to justice . \nnow , during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber , the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes , \" what goes around really goes around . \" \nshortly thereafter , he begins to sing \" time is on my side \" as he's taken on his last walk . \nminutes later , the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead . \nbut for hobbes , the nightmare is just beginning , because reese wasn't a normal psychopath ? he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel . \nand , with reese's death , azazel is free to hop from body to body , murdering and wreaking havoc at will . \nonly hobbes and a pretty , female theology teacher ( embeth davidtz ) have an inkling of what they're up against . \nthe rest of the cops , including hobbes' partner , jonesy ( john goodman ) ; lou ( james gandolfini ) , a newcomer to the department ; and lieutenant stanton ( donald sutherland ) , don't have a clue , and , as a result , they are in mortal danger . \nas depicted by hoblit ( primal fear ) and cinematographer newton thomas sigel , philadelphia is a dark , dreary place ? a gothic city rather than a modern one . \nno skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown . \nthe most famous landmark to appear isn't the liberty bell or independence hall ; it's geno's steaks . \nshadows and night scenes abound . \nthe days are cloudy and unpromising . \nthis is the kind of setting where it's easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men . \nfallen's plot is brimming with potential , not all of which is realized . \nsomehow , i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise . \nbut the level of terror , like that of gore , is kept in check . \nnevertheless , there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks . \nthe film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual . \nof the several dozen actors to play azazel , the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica , crash ) , who , despite only being on screen for about ten minutes , gives a fantastically charged performance . \njohn goodman also seems to be enjoying himself , although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick . \nsadly , however , these two are the only ones who excel . \neveryone else , including denzel washington , is boring . \nwashington's flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film . \nit's not that he's bad per se , but he's not very interesting . \nthere's no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character , and that keeps us distanced , however slightly , from hobbes . \nas circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop , and as his life-or-death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate , i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was . \nwashington's subdued approach is part of the reason for this ; i never felt a sense of urgency . \nhowever , at least washington was believable , which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz ( schindler's list ) and donald sutherland . \nto be fair , the flaws in their characters aren't all acting-related ; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well-written . \nthat said , however , there's nothing inspired about either davidtz's or sutherland's work . \nboth appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts , as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi-dimensional individual . \nnarratively , fallen has a few glaring weaknesses . \nalthough the plot proceeds with a convoluted , game-like structure , it uses a denzel washington-supplied voiceover to overexplain matters . \nat times , this is actually helpful , and it has a use beyond the obvious , but there are occasions when ponderous lines like \" i like the night ? sometimes you come face to face with yourself \" become a little hard to swallow . \nin addition , fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland , generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel . \nhowever , despite the negatives , i'm still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending , which i loved . \nthe final scenes are startling , audacious , and unexpected . \nit's not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did . \nat a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes , fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself . \nthis is not a great motion picture , but , considering how bad most january releases are , it's a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours . \nand , whatever you do , don't walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll . \n", "james l . brooks , one of the developers of the simpsons and director of broadcast news , returns to the big screen with this entertaining , if slightly flawed comedy . \nnicholson plays melvin udall , probably the most horrible person ever on the screen . \nhe's racist , homophobic , and never has a good word to say to anyone . \nso , nobody talks to him , except waitress carol conelly ( t . v \nsitcom star hunt , who was last seen in twister , 1996 ) . \nnaturally , udall , conelly and gay neighbor simon bishop ( kinnear ) who nicholson hates , all hit it off in the end . \nlike good will hunting ( 1997 ) and titanic ( 1997 ) , even though the outcome is completely obvious , as good as it gets is an enjoyable , funny and warm comedy . \nnicholson is hilarious as melvin , churning out insults with superb relish . \nonly nicholson could get away with the lines that melvin delivers . \nhunt is also good as waitress carol , and easily rises to the challenge of nicholson . \nthere's also ( thankfully ) a bit of chemistry between them . \nkinnear , as the gay neighbor , seems to have a slightly underwritten role , he's more of a plot convience than a character . \nalthough his performance is good , his character just seems to exist to help melvin and carol come together . \nin fact , the scene stealer is simon's dog , who is funnier than nicholson . \nbut then again , pets are always cute on screen . \nproviding solid support is cuba gooding , jnr ( jerry maguire , 1996 ) and yeardly smith ( who is the voice of lisa simpsons in the simpsons ) although gooding isn't as good as is character in maguire , he is still fun . \nhe overacts a little , but not so much as to be annoying . \nsmith is also good , although she has a fairly small role . \neven director lawrence kasdan ( body heat , 1981 ) makes an appearance as a doctor . \nbut this is primarily nicholsons film , and every scene he's in , he's steals it . \nhe's character is so hateful , though , it's amazing that anyone talks to him at all , especially carol . \nand this is the films main problem . \nit's totally unbelievable that carol would ever consider liking melvin . \nshe doesn't fall in love with him naturally , the film forces her to fall in love with him . \nalso , melvins character seems to go too nice , too quickly . \ni would doubt anyone with a character like melvins would be able to turn back to a nice , loving person . \nit would take a helluva long time , much longer than this film would like to make out . \nbrooks direction is good , though , if a bit average , but he usually manages to get an emotion out of the audience . \nhe handles the comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones ( he tends to pile on to much schmaltz ) but generally he's good . \nthere's also a nice soundtrack by veteran composer hans zimmer . \nbut , generally , as good as it gets achieves what it sets out to do , which is to make the audience feel good by the end of the movie . \nthe movie is a bit overlong , but nicholson is such good fun that the running time passes by pretty quickly . \noverall , as good as it gets is a fun movie , even though it may be unbelivable , and certainly worth seeing ( if just for jack nicholsons performance . ) \nnot quite as good as it gets ( pardon the bad joke ) , but still good fun . \n", "after a stylistic detour with mrs . \nparker and the vicious circle ( which , despite its uncomfortable tone , was close to being a conventional movie ) , director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow , a romantic black comedy about love , betrayal , and self-absorption . \nwhile these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture , rudolph's atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing , if not always pleasant , movie . \nit is said that rudolph is a polarizing director ? meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it . \nuntil mrs . \nparker , i had not been overly impressed by his movies . \ni found equinox , his last pre- mrs . \nparker effort , to be irritating and frustrating . \ni was somewhat surprised , therefore , to discover that i liked afterglow . \nthere are several reasons for this , but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident , mannered aspects of his approach . \nthe characters here are more like real people with genuine problems , the story is absorbing , and the acting is top-notch . \nin short , rudolph has created a world that it's worth spending two hours in . \nafterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples . \njeffrey byron ( jonny lee miller ) is a cold , seemingly-heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife , marianne ( lara flynn boyle ) . \nfor her part , marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level . \nall she's interested in is seducing him during those few days when she's ovulating . \nafter he refuses to make love , she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor . \nthe other couple , lucky ( nick nolte ) and phyllis mann ( julie christie ) , are an older pair , but they're no more content than jeffrey and marianne . \na mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart . \nthey remain married as a matter of convenience , but , since phyllis won't allow lucky to touch her , they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs . \nthe landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable . \nthe four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey . \nthe two of them are immediately attracted to one another , and it doesn't take long before they're lounging together , naked , in her pool . \nmeanwhile , jeffrey , who is captivated by older women , runs into phyllis in a hotel bar , is smitten , and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains . \nthe romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love . \nsex means something different to everyone ? to jeffrey , it's an unpleasant chore , a loss of control ; to marianne , it's a means to a maternal end ; to lucky , it's an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles ; and to phyllis , it's a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness . \nultimately , none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves . \nthe greatest strength of the film lies not in the script , but in the performances . \njonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish , callous , suit-and-tie businessman . \nthose who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity . \nlara flynn boyle , who wasn't impressive in rudolph's equinox , is greatly improved , making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability . \nnick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky , and he manages to deliver some of rudolph's most pregnant lines with practiced ease . \nthe clear standout , however , is julie christie , who is nothing short of delicious as the world-weary phyllis . \nher often wry , occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film's humor , and there's hardly ever a moment when she doesn't steal the spotlight from her co-stars . \ni don't know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph- detractors , but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the director's earlier productions . \nenough of his trademark style remains , however , to reassure his supporters . \nafterglow is basically a four-pronged character study . \nthe plot is not especially compelling , but the character interaction is , and that's the real reason to see this motion picture . \nrudolph has painted an able picture of the non-romantic side of love -- the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction . \n", " \" the fugitive \" is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made . \nit takes realistic , believable characters and tells an exciting story that's totally believable throughout . \nthis isn't an over-the-top action flick for the sake of action , this is an intelligent adventure story with a real sense of mystery to it and it works perfectly . \nharrison ford stars as dr . richard kimble , a man who is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife . \nthe entire premise of the story revolves around this murder , but is not told in a straightforward manner . \nwe constantly see flashbacks to the murder from kimble's perspective . \nhints are dropped from various times of the night kimble's wife , helen ( sela ward ) was murdered . \nwe don't get to see who the killer is until much further into the story . \nin fact , we might even have a little doubt about kimble's innocence ourselves . \nthe film doesn't spend much time on the details of kimble's trial and conviction as it is not the point of the story . \none of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to a fantastic train wreck . \nbut it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated , it is actually suspenseful to watch . \nthis movie is so incredible because it's able to take elements like these and make them wholly original and believable . \ntommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard , a u . s . marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives . \nfrom the moment he appears we know a huge game of cat and mouse is about to occur . \nkimble and gerard are equally matched as there is no way to tell how one is going to outsmart the other . \nmost of the film deals with richard's complex investigation as he tries to find the one-armed man who killed his wife . \nford does not have a lot of lines here , so it is stuart and twohy's script and davis's outstanding direction that make the film as great as it is . \njust watching richard use his keen intelligence and wits , disguising himself , and doing his own detective work is very interesting . \nwe know just as little as he does as to why his wife was killed , so as he learns more so do we . \nmeanwhile gerard and his staff are using all their skills to hunt him down . \nat one point they run into each other and a great chase ensues , but richard is just too smart for them . \nhe leaves clues for gerard to show his innocence and to help him solve the mystery . \none of the greatest charms to the film is its sense of humor . \nthere is a great sense of comradeship between gerard and his two closest deputies cosmo renfo ( pantoliano ) and biggs ( roebuck ) . \nthey are trying to catch what they believe to be a dangerous murderer , yet they constantly start up small talk with each other , making funny wisecracks and one-liners , but not in any kind of distracting manner . \nthe final act concludes with another terrific chase . \nrichard figures out who the killer is and confronts him , and although we get a typical fight scene , the case is far from solved . \nthe man who ordered the murder has been under our nose all along , and we don't realize this until the end when both richard and gerard put the pieces together . \nmaybe the finally scene is a bit much , but it still has a believable atmosphere to it . \nwe're so relieved when justice is served . \nit's not the plot is that makes \" the fugitive \" great , it's all the motions the characters go through to make for an intriguing story . \nwatching a seemingly average man go through as much as this is what makes the movie so adventurous . \nif only hollywood could produce more movies like this . \n ( 10/31/96 ) ( 1/29/97 ) ( 6/13/97 ) [see also : \" nick of

hard to not predict films as i'm watching them ( especially not romantic comedies ) , the plot of this particular film just advanced before me seconds , and sometimes minutes , before i actually saw it happen on screen . \nbut i don't care . \nnot even a little . \nmy reasons for this are simple : 1 ) adam sandler is great . \n2 ) drew barrymore is great . \n3 ) the movie is so funny . \nthere are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard . \ni haven't laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers . \nsandler plays robby hart , a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band and writing his own music . \nin the opening scenes , he seems like a happy-go-lucky wedding singer , at least partially enjoying his profession and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual ( steve buscemi ) who decides that his brother's wedding is a good place to tell the whole world that his life , up to that point , was utter pointlessness . \na week later , at his own wedding , he is left standing at the altar by his ex-fianc ? e , linda ( angela featherstone ) . \nwith his life in complete disarray , he meets julia ( barrymore ) , a waitress . \nshe is engaged to glenn ( matthew glave ) , and is to marry him in about three months . \njulia and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans . \nsoon ( and predictably ) it becomes pretty clear that glenn is a jerk , and that robby and julia really love each other . \noh sure , it's trite . \nand if anyone making this film expected us to , like , feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer , then they truly underestimated their audience . \nwhat makes the story bearable , aside from the terrific costumes and 80s music , are the performances . \nbarrymore is simply adorable here ( i've never seen her look so close to the way she did in et ) . \nnot only is she pleasant to look at , but her acting job here really is a good one--and it doesn't hurt that the character is likable and adequately well-written . \nand the jerk , played in full-force by graves , is just as despicable as any villain in any romantic comedy i've ever seen . \nnaturally , the true star here is sandler . \ni think the guy is flat-out hilarious . \nhe can say something that just isn't funny , and his delivery makes me laugh . \nhis comedic performance here equals that of happy gilmore , but in this film he goes much further and proves to me that he can , indeed , hold his own as a leading man in a romantic comedy . \nwhereas his roles in his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler , the wedding singer gives him a character that , for the first time , he actually has to fit into . \nas far as i'm concerned he succeeded , and this film is testimony that he does , in fact , have some range in his talents . \nand the movie is just so funny . \nperhaps the best moment is when he sings a song for julia that he claims is a little uneven because he began writing it while in a good mood and finished it after his fianc ? e abandoned him . \nthis is the part that literally had me groping for a breath of air . \nand while the film , like all romantic comedies , takes a hiatus from laughs towards the end because the plot has to finish up , there are more than enough truly hilarious moments in the first hour that make up for any slumps in progress during the second half . \nmy formal complaints for the wedding singer aren't very important . \nthe film is predicable , but who cares ? \nthe characters are extremely likable , the movie is ridiculously funny , and the experience is simply enjoyable . \nin addition to this , i can't imagine anyone seeing the preview and not wanting to see the film . \nin that order , i conclude that it is pointless for me to even have written this review . \ni just want everyone to know that i laughed . \na lot . \n", "based on the boris karloff's classic by the same name , the mummy starts off with the high-priest of osiris , imhotep , who murders the pharoah for his mistress and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifying way possible -- bandaged up , having his tongue removed , and being covered in flesh-eating scarab beetles , then entombed . . . all while still alive . \nrecap a few thousand years later , where a soldier named rick ( played by brandan fraser ) aids a young historian named evelyn ( played by rachel wiesz ) and her brother , jonathan ( played by john hannah ) in finding the book of amon ra , in the process inadvertently freeing the mummy . \nproblem is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress , using evelyn as a sacrifice . . . \nwalking in with relatively low expectations , i thought this movie was actually pretty good . \nthe visuals and cgi are astounding , and obviously not cheaply done at all . \nthey pack a ton of detail into the images , especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by cgi . \nthe computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes , such as unnerving moments involving flesh-eating scarab beetles and moments where the mummy goes after the people who freed him ( after all , those who took his artifacts are cursed ) . \nunfortunately , the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of time , becoming a tug of war for control between genres . \non one hand , it is a fast paced action film . \non the other , it's a frightening horror film . \nand on the side , it's a hilarious comedy . \nideally , for it to be successful , the film would have to focus on one the more action oriented aspect , with one character serving as the comic relief ( that would be johnson ) . \nthe problem with this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief , with rick occasionally delivering his witty one-liner . \nif they were trying to make a horror-action-comedy , it would have helped if it were established early on in the film , but unfortunately , with the backstory of imhotep's entombment , that would be impossible . \nand then there's the slapstick fight scene between a sword-wielding rick and an army of mummies . \nwhile really well done , it had the feel of slapstick comedy . \nreplace the sword with a chainsaw and you'd effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness . \nwhile entertaining and funny , it feels really out of place . \nbut at least it's a break from the naive heroes that brendan fraser has been playing a lot of . \non the whole , the movie is pure popcorn fare from beginning to end , entertaining the audience . \nbut i must end my review with a plea to movie theatre owners . . . turn \nthe sound down ! \nwhile a lot of theatres have good sound systems , my ears were almost ringing as i walked out of the theatre ( the sound is particularly irritating and will make you crap your pants if you're not careful ) . \nwhen they were showing the trailer for the upcoming schwarzenegger film , \" end of days \" , it was so loud i couldn't make anything out . \n", "on re-watching italian writer/director dario argento's much lauded murder mystery tenebrae , i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with . \nin emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his \" giallo \" murder mysteries . \nwhile it's certainly not perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller . \nthe story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book \" tenebrae \" . \nwith the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems . \nthe film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa . \nhe brings grace , charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real-life horror around him . \nthe film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension . \nargento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral , ambivalent , shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business . \ntenebrae is perhaps the most multi-layered of argento's scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here . \nit may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play . \nin that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso ( the full-length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes . \nneedless to say for argento fans , there is no denying the director's brilliance as a stylist . \nmany of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork . \nthey are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light , rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria . \ninstead , tenebrae's set design and lighting paints a sleek , clinical , chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world . \nand the soundtrack's mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment . \nso tenebrae has much to recommend it , no question . \nstill , constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative . \nsome critics argue that logic doesn't matter in argento films , but damnit , it matters in all films to the point where viewers don't deserve to feel cheated . \nby the way , if you don't want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs . \nabout an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which , properly handled , could have proved ingenious . \nwe witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who , we later discover , is none other than the author peter neal . \nhe is insane , apparently . \nthe murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it's time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife . \nhe is finally revealed to us as this \" second killer \" in the film's bloody climax . \nbut argento muffs the twist , both technically and narratively . \nyou see , we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer's house . \nbut thanks to poor editing , its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway . \nbad cutting puts the timing way out . \nin other words , he's almost in two places at once . \nduring this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring . \nby the film's end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self-inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant . \nthe injury ? \nhe banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock ! \nthus , the revelation of the \" hero \" as a killer ( and anti-hero ) in the final scenes may still prove shocking , but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled . \nhelpfully , in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along . \nbut there too is a problem , as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least . \nthe story owes us a better understanding of franciosa's mind , his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage . \ntenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies . \nfor instance , a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike . \nwe would assume the rider is the same boy , but it turns out to be some male character we aren't even introduced too ! \nthat's careless filmmaking , pure and simple . \nwhy , you may ask , do i go on about the story's flaws ? \nbecause when it comes to visuals and set pieces , argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world . \ntake one of the extended scenes in tenebrae . \nan upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where - almost unbelievably - it jumps a high fence and chases her across town . \nfinally , as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine , she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer's lair . \nit's an absolutely masterful sequence , tense and exciting , and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone . \nand that's exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating . \ntoo often , it seems , argento's films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts . \nmind you , if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look . \nand if you're a fan of argento's unique style of giallo thriller then it's essential . \nsee the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli . \nit's a stylish , great-looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative . \na shame , because it doesn't have to be that way . \ntake argento's more recent stendhal syndrome ( 1992 ) , where with the aid of co-writer franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache . \nproof that he can do it , if he tries . . . \n", "as any sociologist will attest , your childhood and the types of parents that you have will heavily influence your happiness as an adult . \nparents that are supportive and environments that are nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms that can allow them to live healthy and productive lives . \nbut if your upbringing is marred with violence , hate and dysfunctionality , then your journey towards a happy adulthood will be saddled with psychological obstacles almost too great to overcome . \n`affliction' explores how a man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly nightmarish childhood . \nthe man in question is wade whitehouse ( nick nolte ) . \nhere is a man who is like any other citizen on the surface . \nhe is a productive member of the community and goes about his daily routine much like you and me . \nbut as you scratch beneath the surface , something scary and evil begins to rear its ugly head . \nwe see that he is a mean-tempered person . \nhe has a hard time taking control of his emotions , which usually gets the better of him . \nhe is quick to apologize for his actions and wants to be a gentle person , but something is sparking a tendency towards violence . \nhe also has tremendous problems with relationships . \nhe is divorced and his only connection to love is his daughter . \nbut his bearish persona and stature alienates her . \nhe is visibly shaken by her rejection even though she says that she loves him . \nhis demeanor also puts his relationship with a local townsgirl ( sissy spacek ) at risk . \nshe tries to remain true to him and supportive , but for women unlucky enough to attach themselves to this kind of person , relationships will ultimately end like sentences ending with an exclamation point . \nfinally , he is spiteful and vindictive . \nas a rejected father , he initiates a custody battle that seems hopeless . \nas the town's only police officer , he issues a speeding ticket to a man whose father has just died . \nwe can see that this is a man that is both afflicted and living with pain . \nhe is a prisoner and a slave to it . \nhe is moving towards a level of madness and insanity that defies comprehension . \nwhat kind of force can move a man to the edge of his emotions and beyond the reach of people who genuinely care for him ? \nwe learn that the answer is his father ( james coburn ) . \nthis is the kind of father that every son would be ashamed to have and that any woman would be afraid to meet . \nhe is an overbearingly misogynistic and frequent drunk who rules with an iron fist . \nwe see his tyrannical behavior through flashbacks . \nto heighten the father's churlishness , the flashbacks are shown as home video footage taken by a very frightened person . \nvery effective . \ntoday , wade's dad is quite elderly , but still manages to instill fear into a grown man . \nthe influence that the father possesses is inescapable , and its unsavory effect clamps down hard on the tortured wade . \nthe result is every son's nightmare ? becoming like the father that one has always dreaded to be . \nthis is a terrifically presented piece of psychological drama , and nolte turns in a strong performance as a man whose pain seems to become a detriment as well as a necessity . \nhe's a hulking person who is still reduced to whimpers when in the presence of his father . \ncoburn displays heft as the bitter dad . \nbut , it's most certainly not saturday-night-friendly fare . \nthere's nothing light or fluffy about this film . \nthat may turn many moviegoers away . \nbut it's certainly worth noting that this is a well-acted drama showcasing nolte's and coburn's raw acting talents . \n", "is evil dead ii a bad movie ? \nit's full of terrible acting , pointless violence , and plot holes yet it remains a cult classic nearly fifteen years after its release . \nexplaining why this movie stands out from others with similar plots ( including the original evil dead ) is extremely difficult . \n`well what's it about ? ' \n`five people stranded in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere struggling to survive vicious attacks from a variety of ugly , hairy , wart covered monsters . ' \n`come on i saw a movie just like that on monster vision last week . \nwhy should i see it again ? ' \n`no evil dead ii is different , it's funny . ' \n`it's funny to see people die ? \nare you sick or something ? ' \nmaybe i am and maybe director sam raimi is as well to create such an enigma of a movie . \nhis unique execution is as sarcastic as subtle , as disturbing as it is hilarious . \nan example of raimi's odd approach : a monster ( formerly protagonist ash's girlfriend of all people ) is cut in half by a chainsaw and a tidal wave of blood comes from the open wound . \nsure it's over-the-top , but it is so over-the-top that it is laugh out loud funny ; just try watching ash with a straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons of blood , staining his face and knocking him back a few feet . \nthe whole movie is like this , watch ash get beat up , watch ash defeat the monster , watch ash get beat up again by another even zanier monster . \nthe more repetitive and unrealistic the movie gets , the more amusing it becomes . \nno matter how sick it may sound , it is funny to watch bruce ampbell's ash get his butt kicked every five minutes . \nand raimi takes advantage , he has ash tormented by the head of his girlfriend , by the body of an old lady , even by his own right hand . \nlike the less superior idle hands , we watch ash uncontrollably hit himself over and over again until he is forced to cut off his own body part . \nbut it doesn't end , ash now has to fight his severed hand which now moves with the same celerity as thing from the addams family . \nall of these events , thrown at you from minute one with roller coaster- like camera movements , at first become shocking , then inexplicably funny . \nraimi expects the audience to laugh and as the film progresses , he seems to be enjoying himself even more by borrowing the classic mirror scene from the marx brothers' duck soup , then bringing more characters into the picture to comically kill them off . \nwith a running time of less than an hour and a half , raimi gets away with the impossible , making a horror film with more gore than plot and intentionally more laughs than scares . \nending evil dead ii with an opening for the third film in the series , raimi obviously had a lot of fun making this movie and couldn't wait to make it's sequel . \n", "it's rather strange too have two computer animated talking ant movies come out in a single year , but that is what disney and pixar animation ; s latest film represents . \nwhile a bugs life isn't nearly as deep as it's predecessor , dreamwork's antz , it is just as funny . \na bug's life centers , appropriately , around the life of an ant , named flik . \nflik , cutely voiced by newsradio's david foley , hates sticking too tradition and attempts too find new ways of harvesting food and other task . \nwhen one of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost , the leaders of the colony send him out on a mission too get him out of the way . \nthe offering is food that a vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest for them . \nthe leader of the grasshoppers is hopper , who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey . \nwhen the offering is lost hopper is very upset and he vows to return shortly too retrieve double the amount of food . \nwhen the leaders of the ant colony send flik out on his mission , they never dream he will be successful , they just hope they can get him out of the way so they can harvest the extra food . \nflik's mission is too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers when they return . \ninstead flik accidentally hires circus performing bugs , who he mistakenly assumes are warriors . \nwhen he returns with the `warriors' , the town is ecstatic until they find out the truth about their heroes . \na bug's life has animation that is simply stunning . \nthe sheer uniqueness of the day to day bug life is very imaginative . \ntogether with the great voice acting , this film is the perfect holiday family film . \nits main weakness is that it couldn't beat antz to the theaters , making it seem like stale material . \n", "not since oliver stone's natural born killers has there been a movie this incendiary , and not since david cronenberg has a so-called mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary and outright social irresponsibility . \nwhile fincher's films have never suffered from a lack of shock value ( his major character killings in both alien 3 and seven are fine examples ) , fight club marks the distillation of his pitch-black comedic sensibility ( see 1997's the game ) into something like a definitive statement . \njack ( norton , acting as both narrator and protagonist ) is your typical cubicle clone , whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia . \non the offhand advice of a doctor , he sits in on group-therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testicular cancer . \nhere he meets bob ( marvin lee aday , aka meat loaf ) , a cancer-emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia . \nstrangely , the release he finds while sobbing on bob's breasts allows him to sleep at night , at least until a fellow group-therapy \" tourist \" named marla singer ( carter ) comes along to ruin things for him , forcing a grudging compromise that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity . \nlater , he meets tyler durden ( pitt ) , a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook on life . \none night , after his ikea- furnished condo explodes ( don't ask-- you'll just have to see the movie , awright ? ) , he is goaded by tyler into a fight , and damned if it doesn't feel good . \nit is pure , raw existence , a brief moment of clarity and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison . \nhe moves into tyler's squalid abandoned mansion , and they form the titular organization , an underground therapy group where men bond with bare-knuckle savagery and very few rules , the first two of which are \" don't talk about fight club . \" \narmed with charisma and an attractive anti-corporate philosophy , tyler assumes leadership of the burgeoning membership of white-collar slaves and dead-end mcemployees . \nresentment creeps into jack's heart , made worse by the fact that tyler is also regularly and noisily boffing the hated marla . \nfunded by a frivolous lawsuit , tyler begins molding his devotees into an army dedicated to mischief and mayhem . \ntheir initially juvenile pranks ( like pissing in food and putting spike belts on roads ) quickly evolve into something more like sedition , and jack fears that things have gone sour . \nit is after this point , when you are plenty uncomfortable and wondering just how far fincher will go to say something original , that the film uncorks a disappointing plot twist . \nit is so contrived-- and so conventional compared to what precedes it-- that everything which follows ( including the ending ) becomes far less interesting . \nit's a major ( though not fatal ) flaw , and for a director as notoriously unpredictable as fincher , it feels like a cop-out . \nfight club is going to be misconstrued by a great many people . \nin the early going , it has a downright dangerous feel ; it seems to be saying that violence and civil disobedience are good for the soul , and this is undoubtedly the message that a few moronic punks are going to take from it . \ni'll be mightily surprised if imitation fight clubs don't spring up here and there , and i'll be even more amazed if fincher isn't vilified for it by the same humorless witch-hunters that are currently after oliver stone . \nthey needn't bother , because fight club is less a message movie than fincher's elaborate attempt at a joke . \ntyler durden , for all his dionysian allure , is really nothing more than the logical ( and far less hypocritical ) extrapolation of all those self-help gurus who constantly show up on oprah to preach their me-first gospel of self-actualization . \nin this context , the joke works , but like the latest columbine joke , some people will get it and enjoy a good laugh , and others won't . \nhopefully , though , their silly moral outrage won't spoil the joke for the rest of us . \n", "plot : a bunch of bad guys dressed up as elvis impersonators rob a vegas casino during a presley convention . \nthe boys eventually get together to split the money , but as plans change , double-crosses occur , dealing and wheeling goes down and the crew set up for the road . \nwho's on the up and up , who's the real bad guy and who's gonna get to bang courteney cox are just a few of the questions which will be answered by the rest of this movie . \ncritique : the funnest movie that i've seen so far this year ! \nit's got style , it's got tough guys talkin' shite and it's got plenty of bullets to go around . \na definite hunk-a-hunk-a burnin' adventure ! \na guy's guy movie through and through , and one that'll set your jollies to high if you dig on the rough stuff . \nit's not very original , it goes on for a little too long , but costner and russell make it happen , as two shite-kickin' elvis lovers , who don't stop till they , more or less , drop . \nthis movie's got some pretty intensive shoot-out scenes , one of the coolest robbery scenarios that i've ever witnessed , featuring several elvises with guns a blazin' and the king's music playing in the background , and a decent helping of double-crosses , sharp dialogue and funny moments . \nin fact , even though the cast is filled with many name actors ( b-actors as they might be for the most part ) , most of them do their bit and succeed well in passing the torch onto the next victim . \nbut the true glue that holds this film together , other than the spirit of elvis himself , is costner and russell , who play their badass characters to the t . sure , russell's been down this road before , but costner surprised me with his nastiness . \ni guess he's pissed at all the box-office bombs that he's been in of late , but he sure played a great unstable elvis impersonating robber here . \nin the end , the bottom line with this movie is having fun , kickin' ass and making sure there's enough bubblegum around to chew afterwards . \nand smoke 'em if you got 'em , folks ! \nthere is also this one really great show-down scene between costner and a cop , that'll have you crackin' up and lovin' it all at the same time . \nthe violent scenes in this movie are violent and the entire film is wrapped in a soundtrack that'll kick your arse from this end of the theatre to the next . \nit should actually come to no surprise to anyone that the director of this movie comes from a music video background , with plenty , and i mean plenty , of camera tricks , cuts and edits , but for this kind of flick , it actually works . \nthe film is not perfect though , it starts off with a pretty big bang , but then pulls a way of the gun on us , and slows the pace down somewhat in the middle , while characters intermingle and disperse . \ni was personally kept in the game despite some soft spots , and enjoyed the overall ride for what it was as well . \nand did i mention that courteney cox looked mega-hot in the movie ? \nno . . . okay , \nwell i just did ! \ni coulda done without her whole \" romance \" angle , but to be honest , it doesn't take up much of the film , which is generally covered in blood , explosions , guts and elvis nods . \ntry to see how many \" inside \" connections to the king you can guess . \nof course , it's no secret that i am quite a big elvis fan myself so please take this whole review with that grain of salt in mind . \ni also like these types of \" guy \" movies a lot , and even though the film doesn't bring much originality to the table , it does offer a pretty coherent story , some nice twists and turns , humor and a big ol' helping of whoop-ass coming straight from costner and russell's respective boots . \nprobably not a film for everyone , but definitely for those who enjoy the guns , the charismatic bad guys and a fun , if entirely disposable , adventure . \nnow see how many elvis songs i've used to pun my way through this phony review below . \nthe elvis songs also recommend this movie ! \nso whether you're lonesome tonight or any other night , remember to pack the teddy bear with bullets , leave your little sister at home , bring your bossa nova baby and rock out of that jailhouse , cause this movie ain't one to return to the sender . \ni really beg of you , whether you're stuck in the ghetto or crying in the chapel , to slap this cinematic ring around your neck and love it tender . \nand no suspicious minds either , folks , cause i got stung by this movie , i mean it really shook me up , and unless you're the devil in disguise himself , i think you won't be able to help falling in love with this lucky charm either . \nso don't be cruel , don't turn away , don't curl up with your latest flame tonite ( whether she be a hard-headed woman or not ) and surrender to the hound dog of movies that is this film . \nit's now or never , folks . \ntrust me , i did it my way and the heartbreak hotel of crappy movies that i'd seen so far this year is far behind me . \njoblo has now officially left the sanity of his mind and this building . \nthank you . . . thank \nyou very much ! ! \nwhere's joblo coming from ? \nget

like a mild-mannered neil simonesque tale with mary tyler moore baring her bra touted as the highlight . \ninstead it turns out to be a hilarious film running in high gear from beginning to end . \nthe concept is deceptively pedestrian . \nan adult adopted son is looking for his biological parents and encounters eccentric characters along the way . \nthe movie demonstrates just how far a good script and actors can take a mundane idea . \nthe son and his wife take off on the search accompanied by a woman from the agency who located his parents . \nfollowing one dead end lead after another , each funnier than the previous , they eventually end up in new mexico with his real biological parents : alan alda and lily tomlin . \nit's difficult to condense the mile-a-minute plot . \nseemingly hundreds of scenes jump on top of each other without giving you a chance to recover from the last one . \nwithout giving too much away , one of the better episodes involves a gay federal alcohol , tobacco and firearms agent attempting an arrest while tripping on lsd as his bi-sexual partner is upstairs licking the armpit of a woman while her husband is in the next room seducing their traveling companion . \nand it's all done in a fairly clean , almost ( well , maybe not exactly ) family fare manner . \na grand cast ( tomlin , alda , moore , ben stiller , patricia arquette , tea leoni , george segal ) interacts in a seamless parade of laughs . \ndrawing from a more hyper woody allen style , the film succeeds beyond expectations . \n", "i'm not quite sure how best to go about writing this review . \ni must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinson's political satire \" wag the dog , \" but in retrospect , this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it . \nquite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through , and it didn't do that . \nthey also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and all-too-true attack on the way the american political media works , and it didn't quite do that either . \na few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to stanley kubrick's \" dr . \nstrangelove \" in the tradition of political black comedy , and it most definitely didn't do that . \nthat said , \" wag the dog \" is actually a very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them . \nthe story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean ( robert deniro ) to distract the american public from the accusations that the president , who is up for re-election in two weeks , sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office . \nthe accusations , the script suggests , are probably untrue , but as brean so pointedly puts it , that isn't particularly relevant : the scandal is likely to derail the president's campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood . \nbrean , along with his assistant ( anne heche ) , decide to contact hollywood producer stanley motss ( dustin hoffman ) to enlist his help in concocting enough propaganda and special-effects trickery to make it appear that the u . s . is going to war with albanian terrorists and thus propel the president to victory on a wave of patriotic fervor . \nas i said , \" wag the dog \" is not quite as laugh-out-loud hilarious as i had expected , but there are some genuinely funny moments to be found here , such as when , in an echo of a familiar movie clich ? , the camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting , inspirational music , then cuts to a studio to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom motss has assembled to perform \" we have the right to fight for democracy . \" \nanother scene shows us how , with modern editing equipment , an actress running across a sound stage with a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl and her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village . \nthe most consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda team's attempt to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt . \nwilliam \" old shoe \" schumann ( woody harrelson ) , an ex-military officer who turns out to be a first-class psycho . \nof course , not everything goes as planned ; the cia , for example , realizes what's going on and strikes a deal with the president's electoral opponent to report to the media that the \" fighting \" has ended , forcing motss and brean to come up with a new angle on the supposed albanian crisis . \nstill , even with the cia's involvement , the film falls a little short in terms of making this scenario believable . \nregardless of the official word from the president or the cia , wouldn't the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is , in fact , no fighting going on in albania ? \nthe film never addresses this question , nor does it show the reactions of the american public to the news of the apparent war except for a few scenes which border on the farcical , such as when basketball fans litter the court with shoes in support of the aforementioned sgt . \nschumann ; we are apparently meant to assume that everyone is buying it . \nthere was also an instance , towards the end of the film , in which one of motss's forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict what he and brean had been selling to the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away . \nwith these plot holes , \" wag the dog \" doesn't quite work as a satire of american politics , but it does send up the mentality that might lead to these kinds of machinations in the first place . \nbrean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical ; rather , they worry about how convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money to pull it off . \nthe film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end , as we learn how far they are willing to go in order to keep the propaganda campaign a secret . \nmotss and his hollywood buddies , meanwhile , seem completely out of touch with the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative project . \nin fact , one of the sources of conflict in the film is motss's increasing restlessness with the idea of not being able to take credit for producing the fake war ; in his mind , it is the greatest work of art he has ever created . \ni think it's fair to say that \" wag the dog \" underachieves a little bit : more attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into a four-star film and a classic satire . \nstill , the issue of an american president using war and patriotism to distract from scandals or domestic unpopularity is a very real one . \nwag the dog takes the issue one step further and asks , what if the war wasn't even real ? \nwith this premise and the talented cast , the film still delivers more consistently than most , whatever its flaws . \n", "the sheer horrific audacity of the nazi plan to exterminate the jews of europe is almost incomprehensible . \npeople may make documentaries about it for another hundred years and still not understand the organized , methodical hatred . \nfive concentration camp survivors from the last days of world war ii tell their stories in the last days , the first documentary from steven spielberg's survivors of the shoah visual history foundation . \nthe five interviewees are linked by their hungarian ancestry . \nas the introduction explains , even as germany started to lose the war , the nazis stepped up their extermination of the jews in europe . \nin 1944 , hungary had the last big population of jews within germany's reach , and they became the last target of hitler's \" final solution . \" \neach of the five tells his or her story . \ntheir stories are intercut chronologically , starting from normal life in pre-war hungary . \nthey recall the nazi invasion of hungary , being sent to \" work \" camps and their realization that they were actually in death camps . \nthey recall their horrible , precarious lives in auschwitz and buchenwald ; the deaths of their family and friends ; their loss of hope . \neach recalls his or her unfathomable , eventual liberation . \nand finally , the last days shows their cathartic , pained , modern-day return to their old homes and the camps . \nneedless to say , their stories are horrifying , amazing , and emotionally draining . \nby themselves , the stories would be forceful testaments , but by cutting them in parallel , their impact is multiplied by five . \nthe last days is a talking-heads style documentary -- it's mostly pictures of people telling their stories , intercut with period photographs and newsreel footage . \nin this kind of movie it's almost impossible to get archival pictures from the same time and place being discussed on-screen , but director james moll made a better effort than most at finding specific , or at least relevant , images to go with his subjects' narration . \nthe liner notes ( one of the many nice features of this dvd ) indicate that there is some never-before-seen historical footage in the last days . \nit's not clear which scene it is . \nit could be one of two that i hadn't seen before , both powerful . \none is rare color footage , shot by an american , of piles of victims in cattle cars . \nthere is something jarring , something unsettling about seeing the pictures in color , when so much of the footage from world war ii is in black and white . \nanother segment shows walking skeletons ; survivors who are so starved that they hardly look human anymore . \nthere has been a glut of holocaust movies and i was skeptical that a new documentary would have anything new to say . \nbut by focusing on hungarian jews during the last days of the war , moll told a specific part of the story in a new way , in greater detail . \nand i'm glad he did because his careful filmmaking stands up well compared to other movies on the same subject . \nthe transfer to dvd is rich and beautiful . \nx-mozilla-status : 0009f words for a holocaust documentary , but some of the interviews take place in europe in late spring , when skies are blue and trees are green . \nalso , the movie was shot on 35mm film ( and not video ! ) , \nso the richness and detail are impeccable . \nthe dvd's features are plentiful and well-chosen . \nthere is a theatrical trailer for the movie , which is a great introduction to the subject matter . \nthere are about fifty still photos , both from the production crew and from the private collections of the survivors . \nalso , the disc has two complete versions of the movie ( widescreen and full screen ) , both on the same side . \none of the more interesting dvd features is an outtake segment for each of the survivors ( plus one for the crew ) . \nyou'd think outtakes would be inappropriate in a holocaust documentary , but they're not bloopers . \ninstead , they are solid , moving segments that were probably cut from the film only for length . \none of them continues a confrontation that was only touched on lightly in the film . \nrenee firestone ( one of the five ) spoke on camera with dr . hans m ? nch , a german doctor who ran the medical clinic at auschwitz . \nfirestone was aggressive , questioning the doctor about what his children thought . \nthe doctor was evasive and clearly uncomfortable . \nanother of the outtakes showed bill basch saying a prayer for his dead friends at auschwitz . \nhe ends his prayer by saying \" . . . forgive me for surviving . \" \nit's ambitious to shoot a documentary on 35mm film . \nit's ambitious to make it on a subject that has saturated cable , television , and movies . \nit's ambitious to make it 54 years after the events it covers . \nbut the last days handles all these potential obstacles very well . \nit's only fitting that the dvd , with its wealth of interesting and relevant features , would also be ambitious and successful . \n", "it is easy to label something sentimental or tear jerking when one has not experienced the heartache of losing a child ? whether that may be in life or in death . \nafter having said that , i will also say that this movie does all of the above very well . \none gets that choking sensation in the throat ( because of grief ) when one brother forgives another for a costly mistake , or when a husband hugs his wife after a long estrangement . \nthere is no ocean , no drownings and it does not conjure up memories of yet another ? ordinary people' . \nin fact the only thing remotely connected to the ocean is probably tap water and the toilet flushing ( not that this literally happened in the movie ) . \nso what are the lessons learnt : 1 . \ndon't take your children to class reunions . \n2 . don't leave them alone in the lobby , not even for a second . \nmichelle pfeiffer once again plays the role of a highly-strung wife and mother , a trend that started with ? a thousand acres' and ? one fine day' . \nmy comment is that she is exceptionally fine strung in this movie , so much so that when she has a nervous break down , the veins on her temples bulge impressively . \nwhoopi golberg also puts in an understated performance , playing a lesbian cop , with a name that makes one want to reach for a lollipop . \nlastly , who are the ideal companions for this sort of movie ? my grandmother comes to mind . \n", "i know that \" funnest \" isn't a word . \n \" fun \" is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective . \nbut that's the word that came to me right after viewing \" chicken run . \" \nno wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like \" that was the funnest movie i've ever seen ! \" \nso to hell with webster's -- \" chicken run \" is one of the funnest movies i've seen in a while . \ni can't remember the last time i've seen anything funner . \nthe chickens at tweedy's farm are up to something . \nliving in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box . \none night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer . \nrocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs . tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm's egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan . \nshe orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , \" chickens go in ; pies come out . \" \nwhat sort of pies ? \nchicken pies , of course . \nco-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : \" creature comforts , \" \" the wrong trousers , \" and \" a close shave . \" \nthe latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures . \npart of what made the \" wallace \" films brilliantly entertaining was park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new . \n \" the wrong trousers , \" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and \" a close shave \" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories . \nbut in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived . \nnow teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in \" chicken run . \" \nthe plot is largely lifted from \" the great escape \" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement . \nthing is , the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from somewhere else ; \" chicken run \" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done . \npart of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? \npark and lord milk the incongruity for all it's worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is . \nbut they're * chickens * , so it's funny to us . \nanother thing that helps \" chicken run \" ( and most of park's films ) succeed is the animators' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they're cribbing . \nthere are references to \" the great escape , \" obviously , and \" stalag 17 . \" \nthe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both \" raiders of the lost ark \" and \" indiana jones and the temple of doom . \" \nthere's even a nod to \" the blues brothers , \" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson's nationality and film history . \nthe \" braveheart \" reference is a hoot if you catch it . \nwhen you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , \" chicken run \" is downright brilliant in its execution . \nconsider this : since july of last year , i've seen dozens upon dozens of \" blair witch project \" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online . \nout of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome . \nwhy ? \nbecause once you got past the thought that \" they're parodying that&#8216 ; blair witch' movie , \" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose . \nthey were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing . \nconversely , \" chicken run \" doesn't lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . \nif you've never seen \" indiana jones , \" the chase sequence is still fun . \neven if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character . \npark , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it's understood , and as a result , \" chicken run \" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either . \nenjoyment of this movie doesn't require knowledge of film history , but if you've got it , \" chicken run \" is that much richer . \nthe voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it's hard not to fall in love with every one of them . \nginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on \" absolutely fabulous \" ) nails it . \nshe has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer . \nthe characters' inevitable romance doesn't feel contrived , but sweet . \npoor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn't any help . \njane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence . \nthey even come up with an inspired riff on something that's baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . \none might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of \" chicken run , \" it comes as a delightful surprise . \nthe film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens . \nthe animation is first-rate . \nremember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable \" chicken run \" really is . \nthis movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail . \nas in such top-notch family fare as \" a bug's life \" or \" toy story 2 , \" \" chicken run \" has something to offer in nearly every frame . \ncertainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they'll catch all the details . \nanyway , the movie's just a boatload of fun . \nfunnest damn movie i've seen all year . \n", "capsule : a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg . \njoe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs . \nit lets us see some new dinosaurs ( is that an oxymoron ? ) and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure . \nthe film is neither ambitious nor pretentious . \ni had a good time . \n , low +2 ( -4 to +4 ) \nhere goes my credibility . \nthis is a film on which i expect to be in a minority . \ni liked the third jurassic park film . \ni even liked the second jurassic park film . \nin a lot of ways jurassic park : the lost world was a creative three-way braiding together of michael crichton's novel the lost world , arthur conan doyle's novel the lost world , and the classic silent film version of the doyle . \njp2 was an adventure , as doyle said , \" for the boy who's half man or the man who's half boy . \" \nthat is what all the jurassic park films are . \nexpecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house . \nthe classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomon's mines had under-written characters also . \njurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs . \nthe characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be , and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting . \nsome of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds . \nthat degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require . \ni feel i got my money's worth . \nthe story opens with eric ( played by trevor morgan ) and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica . \nthis was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park . \nthey hope , no doubt , to get a look at the island's dinosaurs from a safe height . \nthe height is safe , but driving the boat in the water is not . \nthe two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended . \nflash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant ( sam neill ) in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide . \nhe has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs . \nbut again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go . \ndoing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple ( william h . macy and tea leoni ) who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs . \nthey too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn . \nhe will fly over this island at a safe altitude just this once . \nright . \nguess what happens next ? \njp3 probably functions better as a sequel than jp2 . \nfirst it has alan grant and ellie sattler ( laura dern ) back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm . \nsattler has a much smaller part in jp3 , but is still present to tie this story to the first . \ncuriously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance . \none thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other , suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time . \nthey did not appear to be conversing in the previous films . \nof course , these raptors look a little different also , so perhaps they are a different related species . \nnot only are they more intelligent than in the past films , they are also more sympathetic . \nin this story they are not just killing machines , they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition . \nthis time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized . \neach new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs , of course . \nin this film a major threat is from a spinosaurus , not as common or as popularly known as a tyrannosaurus , but larger and presumably more nasty . \nit has a crocodile's head and the body that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright . \nperhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs . \nsometimes they just move too fast to see . \noccasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision . \na few times we get unconvincing matte shot , particularly of the laboratory . \nbut there is less money on the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous films . \nthe musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williams's score for the first film . \njoe johnston , who directs , already has to his credit two very good films i recommend the rocketeer and october sky . \na team including alexander payne and jim taylor known for election writes the screenplay . \nthe film they have made is a long way from great cinema , but it still is fun . \nif you get a thrill from seeing what look very much like live dinosaurs alive today , the film is for you . \ni rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n", "just look back two years ago at the coen brothers' comedic gem the big lebowski , change the actors , take away the bowling alley , add a record store , and you've got high fidelity ( or maybe the other way around since nick hornby's novel high fidelity came first ) . \neither way , it's been done before , a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances , yet it remains consistently funny . \nwhy is this ? \nmaybe because you know your life is much better than this , you know these guys are more pathetic than you are , and you know its ok to laugh at them because they're fictional . \ndirector stephen frears , possibly not intentionally , has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day . \nwhen watching high fidelity , expect to laugh at someone else's pain , realize what you are laughing at , and then laugh again . \ni laughed at dick ( todd louiso ) , the shy , timorous , steve buscemi character of lebowski , who seems to know what he is talking about but either can't put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends . \ni laughed at the john goodman character barry ( jack black ) , an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons , pudgy , egotistic , and obnoxious at the same time . \nand i laughed at rob ( john cusack ) , the jeff bridges type , whom the story revolves around . \nrob is the character easiest to relate to , but he is nothing like you at all . \nhe uncontrollably cheats and lies , then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman . \nand like his other miserable friends , pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort . \nhe spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it . \nwhatever human emotions the clash , aretha franklin , and bruce springsteen records hold , rob and co . \ngrasp them and help fill voids in their social lives . \nrob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in . \nduring this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on , rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him . \nbut these aren't any girlfriends ? these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob ( rob's incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life ) . \nthe plot in three words is : women and music . \nthe approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective . \nit gives high fidelity a quickly paced , informal structure , adjectives which perfectly parallel rob's own lifestyle . \nit also helps open the viewer's eyes as to how annoying barry is . \njack black steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball . \njust listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob , who must work with him every day of the week . \nwhat frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes . \njohn cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast , consisting of big stars and character actors , that really defines rob . \nnow instead of rob just talking to the camera , after he explains something , the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say . \nthe only problem with high fidelity is that it doesn't end when it should have ended . \ninstead the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that . \nalso bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie . \nhigh fidelity is a cheerful , old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs . \ni just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen , they make everyone look and feel great . \n", "plot : a human space astronaut accidentally falls upon a planet ruled by apes . \nhe is taken prisoner along with some other humans , and tries his best to escape his simian captors . \noh yeah , and did i mention that the apes can talk ? \nkewl ! \ncritique : despite this film not looking like a \" tim burton movie \" or its lead human character showing any signs of being a human being himself , i did find myself generally entertained throughout most of this film and do recommend it as fun , summer fare . \nalthough the thing that sets this movie apart from all others is definitely its incredible ape make-up jobs and characterizations . \ni mean , i was completely convinced that every single one of these apes was for real ! \ni also have to \" give it up \" to all of the actors inside the costumes , not only for waking up at three in the morning every day to get make-up slobbered all over them for 2-4 hours , but for coming through their costumed exteriors and selling us their characters on the screen as well . \ni especially enjoyed bonham carter's performance , who i believed to be the most developed character in the entire film ( human or ape ) and tim roth's bad guy , who chewed up scenery and oozed evil in every scene in which he took part . \nplot-wise , i liked the beginning of the film , the whole build-up once wahlberg got into the village , the escape and most of the fight scenes , but once things got out into the deserted area ( and the final battle sequence ) , i kinda lost a bit of my interest . \ni was much more intrigued by the interactions between the characters and the whole idea of \" human beings as animals \" then i was about the end battle sequence , which just seemed a bit too typical for this kind of film . \ni also hated the \" kid \" character who just got on my nerves and didn't really care for the way that the battle sequence was resolved ( i won't ruin it here but c'mon guys . . . you \ncoulda thought of something a little more plausible than that , no ? ) . \nbut the thing that held this movie back more than anything else was its lead character , his cold demeanor and the zero chemistry that he shared with either one of his inter-species love interests . \nthis dude didn't seem to give a rat's ass about anyone but himself and i ultimately didn't really care about what happened to him either . \nnow i'm not sure if this was the fault of the actor or the script , but the film suffered because of it . \nvisually , the movie was also nice to look at ( especially the apes ! ) , but i definitely expected greater coolness from tim burton . \nthe \" surprise ending \" that highlighted the original planet of the apes film back in 1968 , felt a little tacked on here , and despite being interesting , didn't really make all that much sense to me ( unless you look at it from a sequel point of view ) . \nso overall , i loved the whole \" feel \" of the planet , the apes that ruled it , the manner in which they treated the humans , screamed , shouted and reverted the entire evolution chain , but didn't appreciate the film's lack of human character development ( why was kris kristofferson even in this movie ? ) and the fact that its lead male and female humans were just plain boring . \nbut i would still recommend this film as a fun , summer movie with laughs , creepiness and a really cool premise . \nps : for anyone who has seen the original , i cannot believe that they didn't at least bring back the scene in which the lead human character ( in this case , mark wahlberg ) goes nuts at the world in which he's suddenly been thrust ( \" this is a mad house ! \" - \ntype of thing ) . \nthe guy in this film barely seems to be \" put off \" by the fact that he's surrounded by apes who can speak english ! ! \nwhere's joblo coming from ? \nthe arrival ( 8/10 ) - battlefield earth ( 7/10 ) - godzilla ( 4/10 ) - instinct ( 6/10 ) - mission to mars ( 3/10 ) - pitch black ( 7/10 ) - ( 1968 ) planet of the apes ( 9/10 ) - sleepy hollow ( 8/10 ) \n", "disaster films have a tendency to be very formulated and very cliched . \nto see a disaster film with actual originality , or at least a decent plot twist , would definitely be a welcome surprise . \nunfortunately , folks , it's not likely . \ndante's peak is cliched , and at times corny , but also pretty decent . \nto be honest , i wasn't very interested in seeing this film , and word of mouth , as well as several reviews , didn't make it sound promising . \nso i was pleasantly surprised that to find that this movie wasn't bad at all . \nit's pretty run of the mill , but it's not something i would say is merely \" ok \" to watch . \nin case you don't know , dante's peak is about a volcano and the city which lives in it's shadow , dante's peak ( who would've guessed , eh ? ) . \npierce brosnan plays the volcanologist sent to study the volcano and , perhaps more by hunch than actual scientific proof , is determined that the volcano will be arupting in the very near future . \ndue to the lack of more substantial evidence , nobody warns the small town , and when they finally do , it's in the middle of the town meeting that the volcano finally blows . \nbrosnan , all around good guy , will , of course , save the day . \n . \n . \nor at least the mayor of dante's peak ( linda hamilton ) . \nnaturally the two will become infatuated with one another . \n ( if you think i just ruined a plot development , you haven't seen very many movies ! ) \nthere's also the virtually neccessary kids and pet dog to tug at your heart strings . \nand of course , the kids or the dog ( at least one or the other ) will do something heroic . \n . \n . \nbut hey , i don't want to ruin all the surprises ! \nif there was a part of you that was hesitating seeing dante's peak merely because it was rumored to be a waste of time , i urge you to watch it and decide for yourself . \nit's not brain food , but it succeeds at what it's meant to be . \n . \n . \nan enjoyable , suspenseful movie about the fury mother nature can unleash ! \n", "in brief : best bleak comedy film since heathers . \nfull of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture . \ngo see it ! \nso , i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on \" hard copy \" with pam smart , the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980's . \n \" hard copy \" 's diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman's fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for . \nsmart replied that she thought kidman's character came off as a dumb , vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal . \n ( smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband . ) \nsmart's got a point . \nit wouldn't be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well-acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version . \nhowever , given a choice between the mass media 'happening' of the real event and the fictionalized movie , i would definitely opt for the later . \nreal murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart , while pretty and alluring , is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman . \nto die for begins in a town called little hope , new hampshire , the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb . \nthe story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being 'on tv . ' \nof course , one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry , played by matt dillon . \nbut , with a little imagination , some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement , our heroine manages to overcome the nay-sayers in her life , at least temporarily . \nkidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne . \ni have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture . \nher portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates . \nkidman knows a star-making role when she sees it and she plays the conscience-deprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven , post-feminist uber-temptress from hell . \nshe is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue , which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way . \nat one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister-in-law . \n \" you know , \" she knowingly exclaims , \" gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever , if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head . \" \nher husband beams at suzanne's profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters . \nthis is very close to pop culture bashing heaven , folks . \nthe other standout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix . \nhe plays jimmy , a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne's sexual favors . \nkidman's character , vapid though she is , is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia , winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland . \nphoenix looks like the very embodiment of gen-x slackerhood ( as envisioned by tabloid tv , of course ) . \nhis jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of a kid who knows that he ain't going anywhere , ever . \nphoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne , someone who actually noticed him . \ngus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , my own private idaho ) direction is first-rate . \nhe keeps the pacing in this not-quite-thriller snapping along . \nvan sant rightly keeps the focus of this movie on the amoral suzanne and doesn't stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions . \nvan sant trusts his material and trusts his audience to 'get it' without stopping to explain what is funny about this all-american story . \nthe screenplay , by buck henry , is absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines i've heard since heathers . \nhenry's story is a blast against the shallowness of the american media and the mindlessness of fame , yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a few characters . \nhenry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets and the result is a crisp and funny mini-classic . \ndanny elfman did the original music for this movie and he delivers another eccentric , loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands . \neither film score would make wonderful background music for halloween trick-or-treat parties . \nall-in-all , a wonderful production , well

when a talented screenwriter can make me feel like a fool . \ni spent the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage , grousing to myself about its transparently planes , trains and automobiles plot machinations , and waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement . \nthis was a mass market romantic comedy , after all , a genre which has been taken over by teenagers and , even in its best days , worked hard to perpetuate the romance = infatuation paradigm . \nthen marc lawrence did something wonderful , something which made the entire film click into place : he showed me a comic love story about grown-ups . \nit certainly didn't look that way from the outset , which introduces groom-to-be ben holmes ( ben affleck ) at his bachelor party , surrounded by friends and family whooping over his \" last night of freedom . \" \nben loves his fiancee bridget ( maura tierney ) , but the doom-and-gloom pronouncements of everyone around him have

free-spirited woman with a string of failed careers and relationships behind her . \nas transportation troubles thwart them at every turn , ben and sarah begin a three-day southward journey in which their connection grows ever stronger , ben seeing in sarah the chances he's never taken and sarah seeing in ben the stability she's never had . \nforces of nature gets off to a solid enough start , setting up the characters and the situations with plenty of witty dialogue . \nben is an ideal role for affleck's easy-going charm , and he plays the straight-laced straight man without forced exasperation . \nsandra bullock , for her part , is more loose and appealing than she has been in her last half-dozen films combined , avoiding her recent habit of playing any semblance of character

hears makes it difficult to enjoy the romance completely . \nlively and funny though it may be on a consistent basis , forces of nature leaves a bitter taste that feels like self-justification . \nthe kicker is that those acidic anecdotes serve exactly the opposite purpose , leading to a surprisingly emotional resolution . \nforces of nature isn't about a man developing a fear of commitment ; it's about a man learning what commitment means _to him_ , learning that it's not what he thought it was . \nlawrence's script feints and dodges before reaching its happy ending , an ending which is happy because people make the choices that make the most sense . \nearlier scenes that might have felt like throwaways take on more resonance , and that bitter taste sweetens into something fresh and genuine . \nthough one too many plot contrivances keep ben and sarah together through the film , and they do exchange the obligatory mutual character analysis of bickering screen couples , forces of nature wraps up so perfectly that you'll end up remembering the humor and the simple wisdom . \nthat is , provided you're not put off by the ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes . \nfor a brisk romantic comedy , forces of nature comes loaded with some of the most over-directed scenes of the year : teetering hand-held shots , why-not low or high angles , sweeping pans . \noccasionally the hyper-real approach works , with cinematographer elliot davis creating a world of fantasy romance ; far more often , hughes refuses to let a scene be what it is , covering it with flourishes so thick you almost can't find what's underneath . \na script this smart and mature deserved a more restrained director , but even hughes' excesses can't spoil this unique concoction . \nforces of nature may restore your faith in romantic comedy as something with the power to enchant , something that can make you happy to be proved wrong when you expect a tale for and about adolescents . \n", "warning : this review contains some spoilers for the 1964 film \" fail-safe . \" \nif you haven't seen the film yet , proceed with caution . \nnutshell : a relevant , intelligent , suspenseful drama . \nstill powerful today , even after the end of the cold war . \n-------------------- \" fail-safe \" ( usa , 1964 ) drama , 111 minutes \nscreenplay by walter bernstein based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced by max e . youngstein directed by sidney lumet \nreview by jamahl epsicokhan -------------------- \nthe most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesn't have a winning side and a losing side . \nin a nuclear confrontation , everybody loses , and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire world--assuming the world survives . \nthe idea--and perhaps the only real option--is to avoid war at all costs . \nthis is the theme of sidney lumet's \" fail-safe , \" a fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler . \n \" fail-safe \" takes place during the heart of the cold war ( the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis ) , when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word : communism . \nthe premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws . \nfive u . s . bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america . \nthe unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner , but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers . \nsuddenly out of contact , and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives , the bomber pilots cannot be recalled , and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike . \na great deal of \" fail-safe \" 's plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u . s . bombers from reaching russia's borders--at any cost . \nthe plot is compelling , and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios . \nthe reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails . \ngeneral bogan ( frank overton ) , taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself ( henry fonda ) , is powerless--the fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated , pre-programmed system that may not be stoppable , simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make a no-win situation winnable . \nthe events in \" fail-safe \" are fascinating because they're anything but predictable , but the real reason \" fail-safe \" works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot . \na key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war , communism , the cold war , and the united states' role in all of it . \nmost of this is through the film's use of the character groeteschele ( walter matthau ) , an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who , incidentally , is on the president's advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war . \nmany of the film's most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices . \nearly in the film , he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of \" strategy \" in a nuclear assault to \" minimize \" casualties . \n \" what's the difference between 60 million and 100 million dead ? \" \na guest asks impatiently . \n \" forty million , \" groeteschele responds wryly . \nthe problem with groeteschele's mindset is that he * believes * nuclear combat to be a viable method of war . \nthe only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals . \ngroeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over . \nyet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off , as general black ( dan o'herlihy ) has often recommended . \non the contrary--according to groeteschele , that would lead to russia having * more * nuclear weapons than the u . s . , which would clearly put america at a disadvantage . \nsuch a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race . \n \" fail-safe \" clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war , and , likewise , it becomes a central theme in the film . \nwhy continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over ? \nis it wise ? \nis it even logical ? \nno , not really . \nalthough \" fail-safe \" is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism , there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial , one-sided sort of way . \nagain , this is achieved through groeteschele , who is easily the film's most important character in terms of the larger-theme significance . \nin addition to providing the central \" pro-nuclear war \" voice that the film warns against , he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism . \nthe context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib . \none of groeteschele's \" logical \" trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it's merely absurd . \nhe labels the average marxist an \" unfeeling , calculating machine \" that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself . \ngroeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u . s . drops the warhead on moscow , the soviets will * instantly * surrender , for to retaliate would invite counter-measures that would further destroy russia's home soil--which must be preserved at all costs . \ngroeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions ; general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revenge--as any normal person would . \nthe irony here is groeteschele's own mechanical theorizing . \nhe is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesn't even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns . \nonce the film makes it evident that turning the u . s . bombers will be impossible , the question becomes what the * consequences * of destroying moscow will be . \njust how will the soviet union's leader react , and what can the president do to convey his best intentions ? \n ( just * how * does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an * mishap * ? ) \nwith the help of his translator buck ( larry hagman ) , the president negotiates at length with the soviet leader , in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity , with lumet's long takes of fonda and hagman in the same frame , exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader . \nwithout getting into too much detail , i will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly , yet necessary and as sensible as possible under the circumstances . \n ( that is , as sensible as a nuclear \" incident \" can probably be . ) \nit does accomplish what it must : it avoids an all-out war , something that simply isn't possible because of its all-too-real consequences . \ndramatically , the ending is quite powerful , and the use of o'herlihy's character as the symbolic \" matador \" ( providing a bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the film's opening ) , is particularly appropriate . \n \" fail-safe \" is a production of a major hollywood studio ( released by columbia pictures ) , and it has the structure of a high-tension suspense thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film . \nnevertheless , under lumet's direction and walter bernstein's intelligent adaptation of burdick's and wheeler's novel , the film continues to have a lasting effect even after the events on screen have unfolded . \nthe film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming . \nbut it was the conscious , human choice to * initialize * this automatic arming that \" fail-safe \" also finds dangerous . \nin retrospect , the arms race seems to be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century . \nit's just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down , rather than continuing groeteschele's dangerous approach of speeding up and causing a possible meltdown . \n", "andrew lloyd webber's musicals , preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice , present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time . \nwebber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as \" oklahoma ! , \" or the slapstickness of shows like \" a funny thing happened on the way to the forum . \" \nthey instead tackle hot issues from our past , and view them differently , and pack them together with redundant , catchy music , as well as thoughtful lyrics . \nlike \" jesus christ superstar , \" which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective ( in the cool tune \" superstar , \" a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn't spread his message wider ) , \" evita \" takes an inventive stance on its topic , this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator , juan per ? n , eva , who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention , much like the woman playing her : madonna ( although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent , among other things ) . \n \" evita \" deals with the rise and fall of eva per ? n , a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan ( jonathan pryce ) , then died at the young age of 33 , creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di ( the two do share a bit in common , although it wasn't like di slept to \" the top \" ) . \nwebber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals , but they always have a point for doing it . \nhere , they wish to expose her for what she is , but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks , her lying , and covering up for her fascist husband , but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions , and her death was very sad . \nit's also a musical , with almost no words not unsung . \nthe film plays like a rock opera , much like their \" jesus christ superstar , \" with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals , even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics , which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience , but also a very entertaining one . \nafter all , this is a musical , and webber's musicals never undermine this . \nthey are a balance of energy and intellectual depth , walking on a fine line between the both , and never stumbling on either side . \nthis is why the beginning of \" evita \" is kind of a let-down . \nokay , it is a let-down . \ni'm not saying the opening moments are bad , because they're pretty good . \nbut what comes after is a lifeless , un-entertaining , and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer ( jimmy nail ) into taking eva to buenos aires after a one-night stand . \nin the musical , it's a fun , energetic sequence , culiminating in the show stopper , \" buenos aires , \" which is also lifeless . \nthen a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer , instead of her leaving him , where she ends up singing the sad tune , \" another suitcase in another hall , \" which was meant for a later character , screwed over by eva . \nthe portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft , seeming like parker and oliver stone , who adapted it for the screen , are afraid to present her for what she is , even while it's being narrated by a hater of eva's , the omnipotent ( antonio banderas ) , who presents her in a negative light . \nfor a while , it looks like alan parker can't pull it off . \nhowever , the film pulls itself together in a flash , and after that song is over , and the giddily nihilistic song \" goodbye and thank you , \" where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend , is magnificent , darkly comical , and just gleeful . \nfrom this point on , the film is hypnotic , satisfying , and satirical . \nno more punches are thrown , and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact . \nwe see eva woo and marry juan , get him out of jail , rise to stardom , falter a bit , come back , and then gradually die of cancer ( i think it was because of cancer ) . \nmore importantly , many of the themes from the musical carry on with this , as well as some filling-in-the-gaps reconnassaince work . \njuan , who is pretty underwritten in the musical , is given some extra scenes , and exposed as what he was for eva : an accessory . \na muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan , and understand his sadness more than we did before . \n>from the \" goodbye and thank you \" number on , the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation , and saved a government , even while it left the nation's people downtrodden . \nbut despite this , the nation still loved eva , and when she slipped into death , the world mourned her because she was a star . \nthat's when our narrator , ch ? , comes out to show that she wasn't the great woman she really was , and expose her fame . \ndescribing this character is difficult , mainly because he has no real realistic background ( he's said to be based on the revolutionary ch ? guevera , but the two probably could have never met , like they do in the film ) , but he serves as a perspective on eva , but even his perspective can't help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death . \nalan parker , no stranger to bizarre musicals ( he's done \" fame , \" \" the committments , \" \" bugsy malone , \" and \" pink floyd the wall \" - the latter which is absolutely brilliant ) , nails the film , exposing everything for what it is . \nwe cry for evita at the end because we feel we should , by the way it is presented . \nhis direction is manipulative for a reason : to show the mourning for what it is . \nand there is energy throughout , with lots of bright colors , and scenes which are cinematically entertaning , as well as enriching and deep , such as the balcony scene where she sings \" don't cry for me , argentina , \" and her death sequence , which is poignant becuase of how sad it is . \nmadonna's golden globe winning performance is much like the movie : starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly , remaning there for the rest of the film . \nat the beginning , she looks like she's too busy concentrating on her singing to act , but she eventually gets it right , though never really getting the presence of , say , patti lupone ( who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s ) . \nher death , though , is brilliant . \nher singing could be better though . \ni know she took lessons to improve her range and all , but it still sounds like she's trying to hard . \nshe sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding ( like . . . patti \nlupone - i heard her sing on an old \" evita \" cd , and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her ) . \nbut it's generally very good , although not up to the brilliance the role really requires . \nantonio banderas , who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days ( i'm one of the few people who thinks he rocks ) , is extremely comanding in his performance , presenting a lovable narrator . \nhis singing is very good , though nothing compared to the original , mandy patinkin . \nhe does have a pretty good singing voice , and a great range . \nand jonathan pryce is pretty awesome , although very brief at times , in his role as juan , seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade . \nalthough it gets off to a rocky start ( \" rocky \" 's polite for what it really is ) , it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical . \nlike the other musical released in '96 ( woody allen's \" everyone says i love you \" ) , it's a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead , but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance . \n", "there's more to a quilt than fabric and thread--each patchwork design has its own unique story ( or stories ) to tell . \nin how to make an american quilt , the first hollywood release from australian director jocelyn moorhouse ( proof ) , we come to understand how the tales of the seven makers imbue their creation with passion and vitality . \nall the sorrows , joys , longings , sufferings , and loves of these women are sewn into their quilt and , as their bittersweet memories are given expression , one young woman applies these lessons of the past to her own uncertain future . \nmotion pictures are filled with male bonding rituals ; how to make an american quilt presents a distinctly feminine alternative . \nthe \" quilting bee \" consists of seven members : sisters gladys ( ann bancroft ) and hy ( ellen burstyn ) ; sophia ( lois smith ) , a woman known for frightening children ; emma ( jean simmons ) , the timid wife of a perpetually unfaithful man ; constance ( kate nelligan ) , who has been having an affair with emma's husband ; anna ( maya angelou ) , the leader of the group ; and marianna ( alfre woodard ) , anna's daughter . \nthe project they're busy with is the wedding quilt for hy's granddaughter , finn ( winona ryder ) , who has just become engaged . \nshe's spending the summer with hy and gladys , and away from her fiance , to decide whether a lifelong commitment is really what she wants , and whether it's better to marry a friend or a lover . \none of the greatest pleasures of how to make an american quilt comes from watching an array of fine performances by an impressive ensemble cast . \nfrom winona ryder , ann bancroft , ellen burstyn , and maya angelou to minor players like rip torn , claire danes , and kate capshaw , this film is overflowing with realized talent . \nthe performances are good enough , in fact , to cover up many of the script's weaknesses . \nhow to make an american quilt is basically an unremarkable , if affecting , tale of love across the generations--a sort of truncated american version of the joy luck club , with a dash of fried green tomatoes added . \nthere are probably too many characters . \nso , instead of really getting to know a few of them , we are presented with quick glimpses into a single defining event in each of their lives . \nwe learn about the root of the smoldering resentment between gladys and hy , and are told the reasons why emma stays with her husband and sophia is so irascible . \nthere are other episodes as well : the love of anna's life , marianna's soul mate , and a look at the reasons why constance entered into an affair with her friend's husband . \nthe sum total of these tales is meant to provide the framework for finn's story : whether to go forward with her marriage or dally with a hunky stranger . \nthere is no emotional epiphany in how to make an american quilt . \nthe stories are all well-told , but it's difficult to really connect with the characters--their moments pass so quickly . \nwhile we certainly feel something for each of the eight principals , our emotional investment is tenuous . \nthere isn't enough depth to pull the viewer in all the way , and many of the personalities and relationships feel half- formed , like a quilt with patches missing . \nto put it bluntly , while i enjoyed watching this film , it didn't \" do much \" for me . \non the whole , how to make an american quilt is a nicely-understated drama that has a lot to say about love , passion , and monogamy in relationships . \nfinn's segment is by far the most compelling , because she's the focal point : her actions are shaped by everyone else's experiences . \nthe other patches of this american quilt are successful only to varying degrees . \nif there's a disappointment here , it's that the script doesn't have more resonance , but the privilege of seeing such a fine cast in top form allows a viewer to enjoy this picture even if the story is somewhat conventional . \n", "mimi leder is probably best known for her stunning work as a director of the hit tv-show er . \nher mast famous episode , \" love's labour lost \" , dealt with the ordeal

\nand i have to say , after a shaky beginning , she does not disappoint . \npeacemaker deals with the theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists , which is obviously nothing new . \nthe first half hour

retelling of planet of the apes is more fun than a barrel of monkeys . \nok , that's off my chest . \nno more monkey puns , i promise . \nseriously , though , planet of the apes is one rip-roarin' summer outing , filled with thrills , action , adventure , wit and bits of funny ( dare i say , monkey ) business . \ni know , i know , i promised . \nand for those film buffs who are fond of the original , burton's version includes a couple tips of the hat to that movie . \nmark wahlberg stars as capt . leo davidson , a deep-space pilot whose ship gets drawn into a magnetic field and hurled into the future . \nhe crash lands on a planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are hunted , captured and sold into slavery . \ndespite being darker than the original , burton's film is not as heavy handed nor as sanctimonious . \nsome of the movie's flashes of humor are surreal as well as typically burton : an organ-grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed . \nthen there are the parents who buy a little girl as a pet for there young daughter . \nthe seller advises the parents to get rid of the girl before she reaches puberty : \" one thing you don't want in your house is a human teen-ager , \" he says . \nyou don't have to be an ape to realize the truth in that statement . \ntouches such as these are what stamps this movie with burton's brand . \nlines that hearken back to the original movie are sprinkled throughout : the first words spoken by an ape to davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness and grabs the simian's foot to try righting himself are : \" take your stinking hand off of me , you damned , dirty human . \" \nanyone familiar with the first version of the film will , of course , recognize the irony in that piece of dialogue . \nanother of burton's in-jokes is to have charlton heston , star of the original , play the chimpanzee father of tim roth's gen . thade . \nthe young chimp goes to visit his dying father . \nboth have one thing in common , a hatred of humans . \nwith his dying breath , the elder spews out his vile : \" damn them , damn them all to hell , \" he says before expiring . \nthat is the famous line heston's taylor shouted at the conclusion of the original after discovering the planet's terrible secret . \nthe performances throughout are top-notch . \nwahlberg plays davidson not as some gung-ho hero , but as a confused and somewhat frightened explorer who only wants to return home . \nhe is reluctant to lead the human rebellion ; his only objective being to find a way off this upside-down planet . \nthis hesitation is what makes his character believable and vulnerable . \nroth is ferocious , cunning , cruel and savage as the fascist chimp who wants to rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity . \nhe leaps and bounds as if he had springs on his feet . \nit is a masterful turn . \nhelena bonham carter is ari , the chimp who believes that apes and humans can live in peace and as equals . \nhers is a smart , compassionate characterization . \nmichael clarke duncan is big and brutal as attar the gorilla aid to thade who blindly follows his leader until his faith is shaken . \na fine comic outing is given by paul giamatti as limbo , the ape slave trader making a living off the misery of the humans he captures . \nas the battle between apes and humans looms , the cowardly limbo pleads , \" can't we all just get along , \" echoing the words of rodney king . \nmuch of the success of planet of the apes goes to burton's technical crew , especially production designer rick heinrichs and the legendary rick baker who created the ape makeup . \nburton's musical collaborator , danny elfman , provides another fine score , though it is not as memorable as his work on batman or sleepy hollow . \nthe movie's only letdown comes at the very end where burton tries to outshock the finale from the 1968 original . \nhe comes close , but falls short . \notherwise , planet of the apes is what a summer movie should be : an amusement park ride filled with lots of action , stunts and a few laughs . \nthis is one feature in which the expectations lived up to the pre-release hype . \n", "urban legend surprised me . \nbased on the last few films the genre has produced ( including but not exclusive to the likes of i know what you did last summer , disturbing behavior and the disappointing halloween : h20 ) , i was positive that i was in store for another mildly entertaining but silly and ultimately boring rehash of the scream phenomena . \nthankfully , legend rose above it's soggy premise to become not only a hip , scary and stylish entertainment , but also what will probably become one of the best films of the year . \nyou're all familiar with the plot ; a bunch of overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac who's identity is not revealed until the closing moments of the film when it turns out to be , you guessed it ; everybody's favorite veteran of the whodunit flicks . . . the \nonly person you didn't suspect ! \nhowever , just because legend doesn't really break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achievements go does not mean that it can't qualify as first-class entertainment . \nit was , believe it or not , one of the funnest times i've had at the movies all year . \nthe thing is , i'm not really sure what made this particular stab ( pardon the pun ) at the genre seem so fresh and alive . \nmaybe it was the above-par performances by the movie's two leads ( jared leto and \" cybil \" actress alicia witt ) . \nor , it could have been the on- target direction by jamie blanks . \nmore likely , though , it was because of the inspired premise . \ni don't think i need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban folklore is much more frightening than a killer fisherman . \nurban legend begins with a sequence that reminded me of the classic scream opener , not so much in plotting as in attention to detail that makes for an absolutely chilling teaser for the rest of the film . \na pretty young coed is driving down a deserted road when ( gasp ! ) a gas problem ( hee-hee ) forces her to stop at an equally deserted gas station for a refill . \none problem , though . \nwould you want to stop at a station run by brad dourif ? \ni thought not . \npredictably , the attendant ends up coaxing her into the main building to sort out a problem with the credit card company . \nit's odd , though , when you pick up a phone to realize that nobody's on the other line . \nnaturally , the potential victim escapes into her car and drives off . \nand the when we least expect it . . . whack ! ! ! \na decapitation . \nit turns out that the creepy looking attendant was just trying to warn her about the maniac in the back seat of the car . \nso who is it this time ? \nthe obvious candidate is the slightly off-kilter professor at the college the girl went to ( none other than freddy kruger himself , robert englund ) , who teaches a class on urban legends . \na-ha . \nor could it be the fame-hungry local journalist ( leto ) looking for a meaty story to put on his resume ? \nlike all movies of this nature , one of the chief pleasures is trying to guess whodunit . \nand it turns out to be , of course , the one you didn't suspect . \ni'm not going to pretend urban legend is anything more than it is , but i must give credit where credit is due . \nand this flick definitely deserves credit for being what not many other recent horror films have been . . . fun . \n * complimentary movie ticket courtesy of valley cinemas in lodi , ca \n", "capsule : the verma family is having a wedding and all the relatives will come for the multi-day festivities . \nmira nair's film is pleasant enough with a little human drama , a few family secrets , some sadness and some happiness . \nyou have seen it all before , but perhaps not from india . \nthe photography is colorful and the music is very agreeable . \n , low +2 ( -4 to +4 ) \nmira nair previously directed salaam bombay and mississippi masala . \nher newest film , written by sabrina dhawan , is very similar to previous films like betsy's wedding but it is set in new delhi . \na wealthy family is having a wedding . \nan indian wedding is a multi-day affair as much a family reunion as a nuptial . \neven more than in the us , it is an excuse for a lavish and extravagant family get-together . \nthe film shows us what the family does together and at the same time follows several family members' individual story lines . \naditi verma is marrying hemant , an indian engineer working in the us . \nshe had previously had a relationship with vikram , her supervisor . \nlatit , her father ( played by naseeruddin shah ) , is juggling many problems , not the least of which is worrying about the caterer has hired pk dubey . \ndubey is a rather eccentric man with a taste for eating the marigolds he uses for decoration . \neven dubey will soon be romantically entangled when he becomes interested in alice , one of the family servants . \nseveral family members arrive giving rise to several plotlines involving sex , family secrets , or both . \nthere are heartbreaks and there are people falling in love . \nsome of the subjects covered are probably near taboo for indian films . \nwestern audiences will appreciate a look at unfamiliar indian customs like women painting their hands with henna . \non the other hand it was not clear ( to me at least ) if scenes like the family singing together are typical of indian culture or if they are a convention of indian musical films . \nthis seems a particularly westernized family with the father wearing american designer sweaters and the family speaking mostly english . \nthe latter will , however , help with an international release . \nsabrina dhawan's screenplay is vibrant with witty dialog . \nwe have seen films with plotting very much like this , but the indian setting makes a great deal of difference . \ndirector mira nair calls the film an affirmation of life . \ni rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n", "the love for family is one of the strongest driving forces in any man's life , especially for those who have fostered their family under precarious circumstances . \nthematically in cinema , love for family has been used frequently and emphatically to highlight more abstract aspects of characters ; it is rare , however , for it to develop as outstandingly as it does in roberto benigni's neo-classic drama , life is beautiful . \nthrough a central cast of father , mother , and son , benigni demonstrates the wonderful , undying love that a family shares in the best of times and the worst of times . \nlife * is * beautiful for guido orefice ( roberto benigni , directing himself here for the sixth time in his career ) , an italian jew , master con man , and aspiring waiter extraordinaire . \nliving in 1930's italy , he lives a carefree life of good fortune ; it is made even better when he happens upon a pretty schoolteacher named dora ( nicoletta braschi ) . \nalthough dora is already engaged , guido manages to sweep her off her feet and persuades her to marry him instead ; the two have a child named joshua ( giorgio cantarini ) . \nunfortunately for the happy family , the third reich and its nazi minions occupy italy and imprison all jews in work camps . \nit is after the movie takes this dramatic turn that the movie's theme of family love becomes the strongest . \nalthough prior to this turning point benigni plays guido with a sort of goofy charm , he relaxes the role to ensure his son's happiness . \nnow , instead of awkwardly seducing the sweet dora , he constantly reassures his son that everything will be all right . \nbenigni's performance is truly a well-rounded one , and certainly one of the more fluid turns all year . \nthe supports are all strong as well , but the movie truly excels in its script . \nlife is beautiful is a self-proclaimed fable , one which tells its story in grand , two-part fashion . \nin certain parts it manages to sink to the level of a \" saturday night live \" spinoff -- a number of humorous skits connected by a token plot -- but in the movie's second half the script's circular nature becomes admirably obvious . \ncharacters make reprise appearances in fine form , and certain events which are intially curious become critically linked to the plot's outcome . \nin all , fans of foreign film will see this as a memorable motion picture , and novice movie-watchers may take this opportunity to see their first \" artsy \" film . \nlife is beautiful is an artsy movie by convention but easily accessible to everyone , and above all is a fine thematic picture . \n", "while watching wes anderson's rushmore , it may be surprising to think that the role of max fischer , the film's anti-hero , was not written with jason schwartzman in mind . \nthe young actor , making his film debut as a 15 year old student at the exclusive rushmore academy is so perfect in the role that it comes as a shock that anderson auditioned some two thousand other prospective stars before discovering schwarztman . \nschwartzman plays max , a student who is more interested in his extra-curricular activities ( such as writing edgy plays like \" serpico \" and being president of the rushmore beekeepers ) but sees his grades suffer as a result . \non the brink of being thrown out , he lands himself in even more hot water when he falls for first grade teacher rosemary cross ( olivia williams ) and enlists the help of millionaire acquaintance herman blume ( the great bill murray ) to build an aquarium ( on rushmore's baseball field ) in her honour . \nunfortunately for everyone involved , blume finds that he has feelings for miss cross as well , which gets in the way of max's plans to woo her . \nmax is one of the best-written characters we've yet seen in the 90s , and schwartzman plays him to perfection in one of the finest comedy performances ever given by someone of his age . \nas everyone else has probably already pointed out , he is reminiscent of a young dustin hoffman ( although i was reminded more of paul from \" the wonder years \" , from a visual standpoint , at least ) . \nhopefully , if he avoids typecasting as weird , quirky loner-types he should earn himself a good career . \nbill murray is his equal as blume , displaying a depth we haven't yet seen from him . \nwhile this isn't his best performance ( that honour goes to groundhog day ) he is still terrific here . \nwilliams isn't given much to do except react to schwartzman and murray , but still does fine work . \nrushmore seems to go just a little too long but , while it isn't a perfect film , it is a definate must-see for anyone who wants to see that rarity , an american coming-of-age film that actually works well without an excessive amount of sentimentality . \nanderson has created a modern classic with a star who should , with any luck , rise to even greater success . \n", "no , i did not read the novel by thomas hardy , \" jude the obscure , \" his final novel ( final because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again - see : i did do some research on it ) about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life . \nbut , after watching the movie , i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is . \n \" jude \" is a satirical film from start to finish about society's way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system , but what's remarkable is how timeless this film is . \nthe film takes place in the late 19th century ( or early 20th - wasn't really sure ) , but its story could even be retold today in modern form , although it'd be kinda different ( a given ) . \nit tells the story of jude ( christopher eccleston - the psychotic accountant from \" shallow grave \" ) - a simple , dim-witted young man with big dreams . \nin its bleak , foreboding opening , shot in grainy black and white , he gets a lesson from phillotson ( liam cunningham ) , his teacher : as they stand upon a mountain , looking upon a city in the distance , he says all you have to do is work hard and you can have anything in the world . \nafter marrying and divorcing an immature woman named arabella ( rachel griffiths ) because they frolicked in the hay ( literally ) but did not ultimately share anything in common , he moves away to a town with a giant university , with a chance to learn more , and get ahead in life . \ntaking a welding job , he works hard while studying constantly for his college bars , reciting latin over and over again , and training himself . \nbut when he sends his application for the school in , he is bluntly told to just remain a worker . \nanother reason for going to this town was because someone in his family lives there : sue ( kate winslet ) , his cousin and a very intelligent but kinda mischevious young woman who wants to be a school teacher . \nshe and jude click eventually and become very endearing friends , so much that when she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job ( for none other than phillotson at the local school ) , there are rumors that she and jude did some nasty business ( nudge nudge ) . \nseveral twists turn in the storyline , and eventually jude and sue do do some nasty business ( an interesting scene , to say the least . . . ) , and are soon born into a controversial non-wedlock , as she eventually gives birth to their baby , and jude inherits his son from arabella , who turns up again after awhile . \nbecause they aren't married , and because they're cousins , they run into problems with every place they go to , carrying around two children everywhere , and only staying in lodges for a very brief period of time , then moving on . \nif you didn't think this was harsh enough , wait till you see what happens later on . . . \nthe sad truth is that jude is one of the miserable people who can never get any luck in this world . \nhe will never gain any true happiness , and any happiness that happens to him will be fleeting , and will probably bring more horrible instances to his life . \npart of it is his fault - he's too optimistic , and too gullible . \nbut society has a way of taking these people , and hurting them until their death . \nthe ending of \" jude \" is bleak because it has to be ( although i hear the ending of the novel is even worse - guess i'll have to read it now ) . \n \" jude \" offers a satirical view on society's cruelties , but shows no way of curing this , and thank heavens it doesn't . \nthere's no way to relinquish the selfishness of society , and any solution would be too small to cure such a mass problem . \nsatire has always been one of the few ways of changing certain people's minds , and that's what \" jude \" is . \nsure , it's one hell of a downer , but it needs to be . \nthe film also posesses two fantastic performances from its two leads , and some good supporting work along with it . \nchristopher eccleston ( slightly resembling richard edson with his new look and dumb expression ) plays jude wonderfully , sometimes bringing a big dumb smile to his face , and making him kind of child-like at other times . \nkate winslet , in a pre- \" titanic \" performance , is brilliant , nailing every psyche of her character , and creating someone who's troubled but very seductive with her personality . \nkate may be the best actress in her age group ( if you don't believe me , see \" titanic , \" branagh's \" hamlet , \" \" sense and sensibility , \" and \" heavenly creatures , \" the latter one being my favorite performance of hers ) . \nin the supporting roles , liam cunningham is a wonderfully flawed teacher , exposing all his bad parts , but ultimately being a pretty good person ; and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as jude's wife , whom he never divorces . \n \" jude \" moves at a very slow pace , and keeps taunting its viewers with chances of happiness for its protagonists , which would drive some people nuts . \nbut those who appreciate good social commentary with their films , no matter how slow or downright depressing they are ( this one is both ) will appreciate \" jude , \" though i doubt anyone truly enjoys it . \n", "quaid stars as a man who has taken up the proffesion of dragonslayer after he feels he is betrayed by a dragon early in the movie . \nhe runs into the last dragon in existence , and there is a genuinely amusing battle between the two which results in a standoff where quaid is in the dragons mouth , but has his sword pointed at the dragons brain . \neventually , they decide to call a truce , and they work out a deal . \nsince he is the last dragon , he will pretend to die and quaid will be able to get paid for it . \ntheir scam works at first , until they come to a town without any money . \ninstead the town sacrifices a girl to the dragon , but of course , draco is a nice droagon , so he won't eat her . there is however a very amusing scene where draco is hitting on the young girl . \nof course , as you can probably tell by the plot , this is a silly movie , but it does know when to take itself seriously at the right times , unlike eddie , which was serious all the time . \nyou could probably call this a medieval comedy , because there are more laughs here than in eddie and spy hard combined . \ndennis quaid makes a fine hero . \npete posthlewaite provides some ghreat comedy as a monk who journeys with them . \ndina meyer is appealing as the sacrificed girl . \nbut lets face it , the movie is really about the dragon , and what an amazing creation he is . \nconnery's voice and ilm team up to provide us with a truly magnificent dragon . \nso , if you are going to see this movie for a strong hard core medieval epic , you are going to the wrong movie . \nif you are going because of the dragon , you will not be dissapointed , and you will be provided with plenty of laughs that smooth out the boring parts in the script . \n", "it has been 20 years since a terrence malick film hit theaters . \nhis new film , the thin red line , is a strange , beautiful , enigmatic mess of a movie . \nthe first thing that jumps out to one when they see the advertisements for this film is the huge cast . \nit is filled with above-the-title stars . \nthe cast , for the most part , gives great performances . \njohn travolta , whose role is nothing more than a cameo , seems not to have attacked his performance with that much verve . \ngeorge clooney , whose role became a cameo in editing , gives a strange performance . \none wonders if he knew that his performance would become the object of ridicule through a character's narration . \nthe rest of the cast , especially nick nolte and elias koteas , are unambiguously fantastic . \nthese actors ( and they are , with two exceptions , men ) were lured by the name of malick . \nterrence malick is a cinematic legend . \nhe has often been called \" the j . d . salinger of cinema . \" \nhis two previous films , badlands and days of heaven , are spectacularly beautiful and obscure motion pictures . \nafter he made them , he disappeared for 20 years . \nthis film marks his return . \nwhat he's made with the thin red line is a film that seems less concerned with plot than with the emotion of the moment . \nthe narration which fills the film ( and perplexes many ) not only lets us hear the narrators ( the characters themselves ) pontificate , but also lets us hear such of-the-moment thoughts as \" i'm scared . \" \nthe rather simple plot of the thin red line is used as a canvas on which many stories are painted . \nthe plot couldly simply be boiled down to an assault on a hill . \na plot synopsis for the thin red line is difficult , because the story is fractured . \nmany stories are here , from the clash between the lieutenant ( elias koteas ) and the savage colonel ( a voracious nick nolte ) to the private ( ben chaplin ) who uses his love for the woman he left behind to keep him going . \nthe fracturing of the story is ultimately a fault . \nit is as if an artist spent an incredible amount of time artfully sculpting tiny statues and then threw them into a box , shook the box , and poured the results onto a table . \nthis basically creates a mess , but the stories can be discerned and enjoyed . \ni'm not declaring that the film has no structure . \nwhile saving private ryan used warfare to bookend the plot , malick uses reflection and glorious shots of nature to bookend about 90 minutes of combat . \nthe battles in the thin red line are astonishing and display a mastery of filmmaking . \nthe astounding cinematography in this film must also be given notice . \nthis film uses color and light in such a fantastic way , that it will be sad to see it degraded when it has to bee transferred to video . \nultimately , malick has crafted a film that is a movie that enjoys looking through the treetops more than regarding the war that rages below them . \nthe film is filled with nature photography and the regarding of nature . \nwhile some have said that the anti-war message and pro-nature tubthumping was juvenile , it was done with so much complexity and thought , that it cannot ever honestly be called childish . \nafter seeing the thin red line , i was haunted by it and am quite ready to see it again . \n", " \" stuart little \" is one of the best family films to come out this year . \nit's a cute , funny and very good-natured film that has nothing for parents to squirm over except a few mild cusswords . \nthough i read the book a long time ago and i really do not remember what it was about , i do know that this film does not disappoint . \nfinally a movie gets released that is as good as the trailer makes it to be , with a few surprising twists , some very funny moments , and a few sentimental moments all mixed in to one great little movie . \nstuart little is a mouse . \nhe has finally gotten a new home after being put up for adoption , he now lives with the littles . \na nice little ( no pun intended ) family that lives in their apartment next to central park in new york city . \nthey have a little boy george ( played by the adorable jonathan lipnicki ) and now they have a new son . \nat first stuart takes a while but he finally adjusts to being part of the family and even getting along with the pet cat . \ngeorge doesn't take too well to having a mouse for a brother at first , but once the two play together they instantly bond . \nstuart however is missing something , and he wants to know who his real parents are . \nthe littles try and find his parents and one day they show up on the doorstep wanting stuart back . \nhesitating the littles know what's best for stuart and so does snowball the pet cat , he and his friends try to get stuart but in the end we find out the truth about stuart's past ending up to a sentimental and very heart-warming ending . \none thing i noticed about the film instantly was the fantastic special effects . \njust like in \" star wars : episode 1--the phantom menace \" stuart little and his family are all computer generated and they look fantastically real . \nfrom the detail of their fur , to the detail of the way the walk ; the special effects team put a lot of time and effort on this $90 million dollar film and it shows . \nanother movie that this has in common with is \" babe \" with it's talking animals and people understanding them . \nit has a family friendly atmosphere and is never really scary or suspenseful enough to even scare the youngest of kids . \nmichael j . fox does the voice of stuart himself and just like in the \" homeward bound \" movies does a fantastic job and brings more out of stuart than anyone else could . \nhe to me fits the character perfectly and ends up making stuart even more lovable . \nanother gem of the film is nathan lane as snowball . \nwhen he was timon in 1994's \" the lion king \" i would have sworn he was a comedian , and now in \" stuart little \" he brings the most out of snowball and makes him one of those characters we love to dislike . \nfor the human actors geena davis who never gives a bad performance does not disappoint here as well . \nshe fits nicely in her character and there is a good chemistry between her and hugh laurie who plays mr . little . \nboth make us believe they are happily in love and married and jonathan lipnicki as their song is even more adorable than he was in 1996's \" jerry maguire \" . \neven though stuart little is completely cgi , the human characters and stuart have a nice chemistry together and even makes us believe they really do care for each other . \n \" stuart little \" is ideal family entertainment for this holiday season and will not disappoint youngsters or adults for that matter . \nwe get entertainment , laughs , cries and more fun at the movies this season than probably any other movie . \nits nice to see a pg rated movie out at christmas that everyone can see . \neven though it has a $90 million dollar budget i'm sure it will make over that or just below it respectively . \nfor all you parents out there trying to find a good family movie , i have yet to see bicentennial man as i write this but as far as i know \" stuart little \" and \" toy story 2 \" are by far the best family films this year . \na winner . ? \n", "as with his other stateside releases , jackie chan's latest chopsocky vehicle , mr . nice guy , is contrived , blockheaded , and lacking in narrative logic . \nbut also like those other films , it is a highly enjoyable ride . \nonce again , chan's screenwriters ( here edward tang and fibe ma ) have taken the easy way out and named their star's character simply jackie , with no last name . \nthis jackie is a world-class chef who co-hosts a popular cooking show on australian television . \nof course , jackie also happens to be a talented martial artist , and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter's ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) expose of a drug dealing ring . \nother plot details , involving a videotape and a biker gang , are irrelevant ; in fact , as is the case with most chan films , the plot itself is just about irrelevant . \nthe sole purpose of mr . nice guy's existence are chan's comic fight scenes , and those here do not disappoint . \ndirector samo hung ( who has a cameo role ) , a longtime collaborator of chan's , does not waste any time putting chan in action , diving head-on into a wild chase/fight/shootout after a brief cooking show prologue . \nother impressive set pieces follow , most notably a chase in a mall , which directly leads to some frenzied , if cliched ( can you say fruit cart ? ) , business involving a runaway carriage ; and an extended late-film sequence at a construction site , in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in some exciting fights involving boards , cement mixers , and a deadly buzzsaw . \nnone of the action sequences in mr . nice guy are as spectacular as supercop's thrilling helicopter-train finale or rumble in the bronx's daring leap between two buildings ; nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor , respectively . \nbut the action delivers , even if the energy peters out before the film's end ( the finale , as spectacular as it is , is a letdown for fans of chan's athletic prowess ) . \nfilmed almost entirely in english ( even so , the voices of some english-speaking actors are laughably dubbed ) , mr . nice guy hints at jackie chan's latest transition to hollywood productions ( he made ill-fated attempts with 1980's the big brawl and 1985's the protector ) ; next in the pipeline is rush hour , a stateside production co-starring chris tucker . \nhopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown , and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong productions such as mr . nice guy , for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands , much like they have been before . \n", "the premise of wag the dog is so simple that it's adequately explained by the commercials . \nwith 11 days to go until the election , the president ( who we never see ) calls in political dirty-tricks artist robert deniro to distract attention from a burgeoning sex scandal . \ndeniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce a \" pageant \" , a phony war against albania , fought on the blue screens of hollywood and the recording studios of nashville , with woody harrelson as the reluctant , psychotic hero . \nand if there wasn't anything more to the movie than this , it would be a second-rate heist comedy at best , enlivened by great actors -- like sneakers goes to washington . \n ( a heist comedy ? \nyup . \ndeniro and hoffman are \" stealing \" the election , so to speak , and the movie is more about how they do it -- and the fun they have doing it -- than anything else . ) \nwag the dog succeeds because it's based one great truth : the american people are stupid . \nok , maybe it's not \" love thy neighbor as thyself \" or even \" two plus two makes four \" , but a truth nonetheless . \n ( any average person who thinks that they're really smart about the two things this movie satirizes -- moviemaking and the political process -- is invited , nay , challenged , to spend a week either watching a movie actually being made or 48 hours straight watching c-span when the house is in session . ) \nand because we're so utterly , predictably stupid , hollywood knows that a certain percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo , washington knows that we won't notice a few million dollars spent here and there on porno art grants and cigar subsidies -- and deniro's character knows that american geography skills are so weak that we won't be able to locate albania on the map . \nthe beauty of wag the dog is that it isn't a light , meaningless comedy about politics ( like speechless , the michael keaton - geena davis picture ) or from the level of light-hearted politcal satire to near-greatness . \nnor is it a hard-edged cynical look at the manner in which a morally-deprived , ethically challenged baby-boomer connives his sleazy way into the white house ( like primary colors -- and yes , i am a little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out , thanks for asking ) . \ninstead , david mamet's script strikes that delicate balance between comedy and cynicism needed for satire . \nit does this by keeping us in a fantasy world where most of the schemers' schemes come off beautifully , and fail only in entertaining and humorous fashion . \ndeniro is playing a variation on his al capone character from the untouchables , without any of the violent rages . \nit's all : \" what do i love ? \nwhat is it that brings me joy ? \nbaseball , \" minus the savage bloody beating with the bat . \nhe threatens a lot of people , mind you , but he's doing it in a very nice , polite way . \nit's a very mellow , restrained performance , which fits in with the air of gamesmanship in the script . \nhoffman , on the other hand , is giddy , exuberant and joyous . \nthis kind of thing is what his character lives for , and he's so excited that he can't even shut up . \neven on the edge of disaster , he's bright-eyed ( behind oddly tinted sunglasses ) and positive . \ninsiders note that he's basing his character on some powerful-but-anonymous producer -- which may or may not be true , but hoffman still exudes the kind of lets-put-on-a-show electricity that you figure a producer needs to have . \nthe best part and the most frustrating part of wag the dog is in the supporting cast . \nthe characters are so well drawn and so well acted that we want to see more of them , listen to them talk in that wised-up mamet dialogue , get to know them better -- which we don't . \nanne heche , is dead-bang-on in her portrayal of a political press aide -- cool and composed on the outside , panicked and frenzied on the outside . \ndenis leary ( one of my favorite actors -- see the ref ) is the \" fad king \" , who handles the profitable \" back-end \" -- t-shirt tie ins and shoe contracts and other creative , innovative ways to separate a fool from his money . \nthey could make a whole movie , just about the fad king , and i'd go see it . \nwillie nelson and merle haggard handle the musical end of things fabulously , from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song , to the weepy country waltz , to the hilarious \" ballad of the green berets \" parody . \nwoody harrelson has a brief , but memorable part as the overmedicated \" hero \" of the albanian conflict . \ncraig t . nelson , as the opposition candidate , and the ever-reliable william h . macy , as a wacky cia agent , are given surprisingly short shrift . \n ( one of my small gripes is that we never see what the spin doctors on the other side are doing . ) \nwag the dog is a funny movie about serious problems : the trivialization of american politics , the role of the press in dumbing down the issues , the impact of hollywood in creating campaign commercials , the reduction of all things political to soundbites and sidebars -- the list goes on . \nwe can solve most of these problems by taking a greater role in our national life and educating ourselves as voters and citizens . \nwag the dog reminds us of what can happen if we don't . \n", "as the film opens up , expectant unwed mother sally ( played by drew barrymore ) encounters her baby's father in a fast food drive-through window . \nafter he gets his milkshake , he drives off , only to be pursued by a military helicopter . \nfrom this moment forward , you know that this isn't going to be your run-of-the-mill romantic comedy . \nhome fries tells the tale of the relationship between sally and dorian ( played by luke wilson ) , a helicopter pilot who has a different kind of connection with sally . . . more \nthan he would care to admit ( hint : it has something to do with the father of sally's unborn child ) . \nafter taking a personal ( and professional ) interest in her , he finds work at the local fast food restaurant at which she works , and the fun goes on from there . \nthis movie is a lot of fun . \nit is comedic on two levels , as a romantic comedy and a dark comedy . \nthe romantic moments are sweet , yet not sappy . \none of the more poignant moments is when dorian accompanies sally to lamaze classes . \nhowever , the dark comedic moments are more memorable . \nthis is also a tale of revenge , and a funny one at that . \nthe father of sally's unborn child also happened to be a married man , whose wife is played by catherine o'hara . \nshe does a wonderful portrayal of a jealous wife who is targeting the person who had an affair , and is not above getting other people to do her dirty work . \n ( my apologies if this sounds cryptic , but there is too much of the plot to give away ) . \nrounding out the cast are jake busey as angus , dorian's overzealous brother and daryl mitchell as roy , dorian's trainer at the fast food restaurant . \nthe dialogue is sharp and not filled with sappy overtones , even with the romantic nature of the plot . \nif there are any complaints , it is over drew barrymore's performance . \nwhile she does light up the screen , there are moments when she doesn't seem all that convincing . \nthe movie was filmed in texas , and most of the characters have southern texan accents . \ndrew barrymore's accent tends to come and go ( luke wilson doesn't seem to have this problem ) . \nas well , she seems awfully agile for a woman that is eight months pregnant . \nstill , this movie is one that will please many viewers . \nwith plot twists galore and hilarious dark moments , this is sure to entertain . \n", "the second jackal-based film to come out in 1997 ( the other starring bruce willis was simply entitled the jackal ) , this one stars aidan quinn and donald sutherland , and is directed by a man who hailed from joblo's own alma matter , concordia university in montreal , canada . \nthe story is based on the exploits of the real terrorist known as the jackal , but does not pretend to be 100% factual . \nplot : naval officer ramirez ( quinn ) gets called upon by the cia to impersonate the international terrorist known as the jackal , in order to put an end to the actual militant's radical activities . \nhe is chosen for this role because he physically resembles the real terrorist to a tee . \nramirez reluctantly agrees to take part in this \" assignment \" , and soon finds himself wrapped up in a true web of international terrorism , intrigue and double-personality syndrome ( which does not sit well with his uninformed wife and kids back in the states . ) \ncritique : great premise is executed with enough style and thrills to keep the piece interesting throughout its close to two-hour runtime . \nadmittedly , i wasn't a huge fan of any of the main actors in this film , and didn't expect much from this movie beforehand , but surprisingly it did have its thrilling moments , as well as a mostly plausible and absorbing story line . \nthe first hour is mostly just a build-up of things to come , and does offer a great characterization of the jackal , but the second hour is the one that really cranks in the cool scenes and a sweet ending . \nquinn was adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez and the real jackal , but didn't offer anything extraordinary , in my opinion . \nsutherland and kingsley seem to be playing the same role that they've played in both of their respective careers of late , but nonetheless , appeared to relish the cold-heartedness of their chosen characters . \ni didn't like performance put forth from quinn's wife in this flick , but then again , she doesn't show up in most of the film , so that wasn't so bad . \ni did however enjoy director duguay's interesting style and cinematic vision . \nthis thriller could easily have been boring during many sequences , but duguay always seemed to find something interesting to show the viewer . \ni thought that was neat . \nhaving said that , i didn't think the first hour needed to be as long as it was , and the film did have me tinkering on the bridge of believability when the \" fake \" jackal met with the \" real \" jackal's girlfriend without much retrospection on her part , but all in all , not too many complaints in a movie that could easily be enjoyed by all those who take pleasure in the spy and terrorist thriller genre . \nlittle known facts : ben kingsley's real name is krishna banji , he stands 5 \" 8 , was born in scarborough , england , and won the best actor honor in 1982's academy awards presentation for the title role he portrayed in ghandi . \nmany scenes from this film were actually shot in montreal , canada ( joblo's haven of restfulness ) . \ndonald sutherland has fathered actor kiefer sutherland , is canadian , and apparently still owns a place in the north of montreal . \n", "one of the last entries in the long-running carry on series , carry on behind is very similar to carry on camping in that it involves a group of holidaymakers descending on a 'caravan' site . \nprofessors anna vrooshka ( elke sommer ) and roland crump ( kenneth williams ) and a group of archaeology students stay in the caravan site owned by major leep ( kenneth connor ) so that they can explore the nearby roman settlement remains . \nanna has a little trouble understanding english and sometimes people get the wrong end of the stick : - for instance , when anna is asking for 'scrubbers for dirty caravan' , she means that she wants a scrubbing brush to clean the caravan ! \narthur upmore ( bernard bresslaw ) and his wife linda ( patsy rowlands ) take her mother daphne barnes ( joan sims ) and her minah bird on holiday with them . \nmother-in-law jokes prevail . \nfurthermore , the trouble that joe and norma baxter ( ian lavender and adrienne posta ) have with their large irish greyhound allows for some comical moments between the two families . \nfred ramsden ( windsor davies ) and ernie bragg ( jack douglas ) leave their wives ( liz fraser and patricia franklin ) behind for a fishing holiday . \nhowever , they have more in mind than fishing when they catch sight of two young girls , sandra ( carol hawkins ) and carol ( sherrie hewson ) . \nthe story involves the disruption caused by the archaeological professors of the day-to-day running of the camp , the search for the minah bid and greyhound , the major , fred and ernie's desperate need of a woman , a misunderstanding leading to a striptease at the caravan park's pub , and a shock in store for daphne . \nthe partnership between sommer and williams is very effective and amusing . \nthis is what binds the movie together . \njoan sims stands out as the demanding mother-in-law , bernard bresslaw and patsy rowlands work well together as husband and wife , and carol hawkins and sherrie hewson are a welcome addition to the cast . \non the other hand , there are low-key performances from kenneth connor and peter butterworth as barnes the handyman , and there are very poor performances by windsor davies and jack douglas who spend far too much time on the screen ! \neven though there is no real plot to speak of and the jokes are getting bluer due to the new scriptwriter dave freeman , there are enough truly comical moments and bright and breezy performances to lift this carry on above many of its predecessors . \nalthough the regular cast is depleted , the ones that remain show that they can still make a good carry on film . \na relative flop at the cinema , this movie deserves a lot more recognition . \n", "the cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime now : \" it mu5t be found . \" \nso what , exactly , is the fifth element ? \nafter seeing luc besson's ambitious , much-shrouded-in-secrecy science fiction fantasy , i could not help but be let down by the actual answer , which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think . \nbut what is far from a letdown is the film as a whole , a wildly imaginative feast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films do--create a universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen . \nthe biggest irony of the fifth element is that the one thing that has been kept under such tight wraps--the actual storyline--is the most conventional , dismayingly so , element ( pun intended ) of the film . \nspeaking in the vaguest possible terms , the basics of the plot are as follows : in the year 2259 , a great force of evil threatens to consume the earth , and only the four elements--earth , wind , fire , and water--united with a fifth element can stop it . \nfiguring into all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas ( bruce willis ) ; a shady , southern-drawling entrepreneur by the name of zorg ( the hilariously hammy gary oldman , picking up where he left off in besson's the professional ) ; a priest ( ian holm ) ; and a mysterious creature named leeloo ( milla jovovich ) . \nall of the pieces come together in a tidy and somewhat underwhelming--and unsurprising--fashion , but there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest . \nwhat remains interesting and exciting , however , after brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has created with production designer dan weil , director of photography thierry arbogast , visual effects supervisor mark stetson , and the crew at digital domain . \nthe look is absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last . \nthe frenzied cityscape of new york , with its vibrant day-glo colors , tall buildings penetrating high into the clouds , and the swarm of cars , cabs , and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways , is absolutely breathtaking to behold , especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film . \nbut it would not have been a completely captivating vision if the people inhabiting the settings weren't equally as interesting , and are they ever . \nin addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this world , from bulky robots to dog-like mangalores , the humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jean-paul gaulthier , best known for creating madonna's pointy bustier get-up in her blonde ambition tour . \ngaulthier's outlandish creations , such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps , feel more at home in besson's futuristic vision than on any fashion runway in the world ; they add to the sense of otherworldliness about the film . \nwhile besson's bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film , it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audience . \nfor all its imagination , certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky and bizarre . \ni really do not know what middle america will make of the most outrageous character of the film , ruby rhod ( chris tucker ) , a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservative--he makes a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress , sporting a blonde hairdo in the shape of a hair dryer , speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed . \nat first this character's hyper energy is funny , but the act wears out its welcome very quickly . \nnot irritating , but just as strange , is a musical number by blue-skinned alien chanteuse diva ( maiwenn lebesco ) , who sings--and dances--an aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera and techno . \nthe tune , as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serra's innovative score , is haunting , but it is also completely jarring . \nthen there are the campy touches of humor besson and co-scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout , which too often are silly and forced ; a comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod and a flight attendant is highly distracting and not very funny , to boot . \nthe story's weakness shines through in the climax and conclusion of the fifth element . \nwhile still visually and aurally spectacular , the events detailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be . \nthe big , serious dramatic climax was met with more than a few snickers , and it ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward . \nas such , at the end there is a sense that there was something bigger at work here , that there was still more left to be said about this story and these characters . \nthis suspicion was confirmed by besson himself , who told me in the lobby following the screening ( imagine that , the filmmaker watching the film with the \" enemy \" --the critics ) that what had made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy original fifth element screenplay and that the second half--now titled mr . shadow--is still waiting to be made . \nstill , despite the story problems , the fifth element is an artistic triumph for luc besson ; rarely does a filmmaker's original vision come to the screen in all its audacious , undiluted glory . \nit is a fascinating example of how of one artist's fervid imagination can transport an audience into an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen only in dreams . \n", " \" very bad things , \" is the most delightfully morbid film of the year , a movie that goes so far over the deep end with its outrageousness and violence that i couldn't help but be won over by the material . \nthe film starts off with five friends leaving their homes in los angeles for a bachelor party in las vegas . \nthe groom-to-be is kyle fisher ( jon favreau ) , who is about to be married to the controlling , wedding-obsessed laura ( cameron diaz ) . \nthe other friends are real estate agent robert boyd ( christian slater ) , quiet charles ( leland orser ) , and brothers , michael ( jeremy piven ) and family man adam ( daniel stern ) . \nafter a wild night of gambling , boozing , and drugs , a stripper ( carla scott ) who was paid for by robert comes into their hotel room , but after a freak accident , to everyone's terror , she is killed . \nas robert puts it : \" there are two options : go to the police and go to prison , or bury her out in the desert where no one will ever find her . \" \nafter a security guard enters into the hotel room unexpectantly and sees the body , robert is forced to kill him as well . \n \" okay , there is only one option now . \nyou can forget about calling the police , \" he says . \nby the time the five friends return home and as the wedding draws nearer , most of them are overcome with guilt , which sets off an even more elaborate series of event , that includes much , much more murder , double-crosses , and the inevitable wedding from hell . \n \" very bad things , \" which is actor peter berg's feature film directing debut , is the shockingly perverse and wicked comedy that , \" there's something about mary , \" wanted to be . \nit pulls out all the stops to create something fresh , original , and hilarious , even if that requires surprisingly graphic violence , gore , and a slew of truly hateful characters that all get what they deserve by the end . \nthe screenplay , also written by berg , is , to put it mildly , very funny and courageous . \nduring the second act of the film , some of the fun was beginning to slightly dwindle due to so much death , which was beginning to undermine the humor , but it eventually recouped itself with a climax that has to be seen to be believed . \nthe dialogue is edgy and inventive , and this film proves that a movie doesn't necessarily require likable character to be extremely enjoyable . \nthere's more fun , i think , in showing ignorable people getting their just desserts . \ncameron diaz gives her best performance to date here , and has a lot of fun in playing the hateful laura , who eventually turns out to be more crazy than any of the five male friends . \ndiaz puts so much overblown energy to her character that i really do think she deserves a supporting actress oscar nomination come next january . \nby the time she is beating someone to death with a coat hanger , and reciting lines like , \" stuff him in the crapper and get your ass upstairs , \" i couldn't help but crack up at how \" balls-to-the-wall \" this film had become . \njeanne tripplehorn creates another character original , as daniel stern's wife , who late in the picture , we discover , is a tough kick-boxer that should not be messed around with . \nit is at this level that , \" very bad things , \" was so entertaining and surprising . \njust when you thought you could predict what was going to happen , there would be a little twist involving the characters that would be absolutely wacky . \nthe last sequence was perfect and managed to go even further over-the-top . \nalthough i enjoyed the film immensely , let me make this clear : \" very bad things , \" is not a movie for everyone . \nit is more tasteless than anything i have ever seen , it is more violent and bloody than a r-rated film usually is , and it is offensive . \nluckily , these are elements that i would prefer in a comedy , since it clearly shows the filmmakers were set on making a no-holds-barred , politically incorrect comedy . \nthe fact that this film slipped through the cracks of the usually mainstream and \" safe \" wide-releases coming out lately , still gives me hope for the hollywood film industry . \n", "it is hard to imagine that a movie which includes abortion and incest as prominent plot devices could be so sensitive , so delicate , so insightful and yes , even so enjoyable . \nsomehow , the cider house rules manages to keep an even keel in the face of the harsh subject matter and allows a substantial amount of heart to shine through . \nset in the 1940's , the film tells the story of a unique young man named homer wells ( tobey maguire , ride with the devil ) . \nan orphan , twice rejected as an infant by possible adoptive parents , he grows up in the care and under the tutelage of dr . wilbur larch ( michael caine , little voice ) , father figure to the orphans of st . cloud , obstetrician or abortionist to the unhappily pregnant women who come there seeking his help . \nfiguring that as long as homer was going to stay at the orphanage , he might as well be of use , dr . larch begins teaching him all he knows about obstetrics . \nsoon homer is delivering babies like a professional . \nhe refuses to perform abortions , instead wondering why the couples just didn't behave more responsibly . \nlarch , too old and experienced to have such youthful ideals , marvels that homer \" continues to have such high expectations of people . \" \nsuch is the result of an insulated upbringing . \nthough skilled in certain medical procedures , homer remains woefully naive and ignorant about most everything else . \nhe finally figures that in order to find his place in the world , he must go out into it . \nbefriending a young couple who had come to see dr . larch , he hitches a ride with them and parlays that into landing a job as an apple picker with a group of black migrant workers at the orchard where they lived . \nthus , homer begins his worldly instruction , with new friend candy kendall ( charlize theron , the astronaut's wife ) a willing tutor . \ntobey maguire is well cast yet again as an inherently good man who is seeking answers to life's questions . . . \nmany of which he was unaware needed to be asked . \nhe demonstrates a quiet strength and thoughtful curiosity that is both warm and appealing . \nmichael caine is , in a word , brilliant as the caring caretaker of these orphans , many of whom he helped to bring into the world . \ncalling them \" princes of maine , kings of new england \" in his ritualistic goodnight , mr . caine manages to communicate the love and commitment larch has towards these children without becoming maudlin or saccharine . \ndelroy lindo ( a life less ordinary ) has many powerful moments as mr . rose , the strong and charismatic leader of the apple pickers whom homer joins . \ndirector lasse hallstrom ( what's eating gilbert grape ? ) and screenwriter/novelist john irving ( the world according to garp ) , who adapted his own work for this movie deserve much of the credit for the balanced approach to the sensitive subject matter . \nregardless of one's personal stand on the divisive matter of abortion , it is hard to imagine anyone becoming offended by the evenhanded treatment used by these filmmakers . \nthe title is a reference to a list of rules posted in the quarters of the illiterate apple pickers . \nfiguring the rules didn't apply to them since they didn't have a hand in writing them , they decide to ignore the list and make up their own rules as they go along . \ndr . larch , in his own way , acts similarly . \nthere is a danger in that line of reasoning . \ngod has also given us a set of rules . \nunlike the list posted in the cider house , god's rules , if followed , promise us benefits beyond our imagination . \nand yet , many continue to ignore his \" rules \" preferring to make up their own as they go through life . \n \" trust in the lord with all thine heart ; and lean not unto thine own understanding . \" \nproverbs 3 : 5 [kjv] \njust as a builder follows a designer's blueprint or a conductor follows a composer's score , why shouldn't we follow the rules of life given to us by life's architect for our own blessing ? \n", "known as the most successful , highest-grossing romantic comedy in history , director garry marshall apparently struck gold with \" pretty woman , \" which opened quietly during the summer of 1990 but , thanks to positive word-of-mouth , was able to reach upwards of $175-million in theaters alone . \nthe question of why it worked so well lies directly with the film's two charismatic stars , richard gere and julia roberts , since the story itself is none too original or even believable . \nthe other winning element that makes \" pretty woman \" so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence , which is rarely as palpable in today's films as it is here . \nedward lewis ( richard gere ) is a suave , extremely wealthy business mogul who , at the start of the picture , breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument , and abruptly takes his friend's car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel . \nstopping the car along the street , he asks a woman , obviously a prostitute , for directions . \nagreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks , edward ultimately accepts , they strike up a conversation , and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor . \nthis meeting does not lead to sex , however , as edward confides that he'd rather just have someone to talk to , and offers her $300 to spend the night . \njust as well , since the hooker , named vivian , is a beautiful , generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear . \nthe meeting between these two completely opposite people does not end the next morning as planned , when edward finally offers to pay vivian three-thousand dollars if she will stay with him for six days and nights while he is in the area , keeping him company and acting as his companion to business dinners and get-togethers . \nsince vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips , which always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers , the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act , edward and vivian will finally , truly , kiss . \nallegedly planned as a grim , downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director , \" pretty woman \" has been transformed in all senses of the word into a classic fairy tale , a la \" cinderella . \" \nthe premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been . \nyou honestly don't need a high-iq ( or any iq , for that matter ) to guess how the film will end , and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha . \nthe supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and less-than-gratifying , and the screenplay is no award winner . \nand yet , amidst all of these qualms and flaws , \" pretty woman \" is an astoundingly charming motion picture , and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers . \nyou'd actually be amazed how far bemusement can go , and there are a few select moments ( not even whole scenes , mind you ) that are as romantic as anything i've seen on film in the 1990's . \nadditionally , the film belongs , and its success can be attributed , to two people and two people only , and they are richard gere and julia roberts . \nplaying sex symbols throughout the '80s with such pictures as \" american gigolo \" and \" an officer and a gentleman , \" gere branches out here to play a more quiet , almost shy , but still alluring , character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet , and vice versa . \njulia roberts , in her breakthrough role after 1988's well-received \" mistic pizza \" and 1989's \" steel magnolia , \" for which she was nominated for an academy award , is radiant and funny as the wordly vivian , who surprisingly could be a role model for impressionistic viewers , not for her line of work , but more for her sheer intelligence . \nit would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely a flake , but screenwriter j . f . lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to do such a thing . \nafter \" pretty woman , \" roberts , along with meg ryan , became the reigning queen of romantic comedies ( with her latest being the just-released \" runaway bride , \" which repairs gere and roberts together once again ) , and no wonder . \nroberts has continually proven to not only be a strong actress with a flare for comedy , but also one who can efficiently do drama , and in almost every film she appears in , it is difficult not to fall in love with her along with her male co-star . \nan especially strong scene that gere and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his co-workers that vivian is actually a prostitute , and he then approaches her , making sexual advances . \nno only does this make vivian feel cheap , especially since she had previously been posing as a more professional , eloquent young lady , but it also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her in such a way , and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading , and if she likes this particular path . \non the more dreamy side , the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold , especially one in which edward enters into the hotel's lounge to see vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress , but also her inner ( and outer ) glowing beauty . \nanother subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward , who is asleep , and placing it on his lips , since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in a short couple of days . \n \" pretty woman \" does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene , which is a happy ending ( as you'd expect , and wouldn't have it any other way ) that somehow does not work , perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances . \nthis one misstep does not put a damper on the rest of the film , though , because there is just far too much magic at work here to disaffirm such a petty problem . \nhelped along by a warm , memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo , as vivian's best friend and roommate , and a fabulously catchy soundtrack , in which all of the songs prominently aid in the movie's overall fulfillment , \" pretty woman \" is a sparkler of a motion picture , and has what it takes to act as a blueprint on how to make the quintessential romantic comedy . \n", "the dramatic comedy cousins has all the necessary ingredients : a witty and whimsical script , inspired performances , a great sense of humor , a large and wonderful cast , and the beautiful scenery of vancouver . \nit's a movie of weddings , marriage , family , infidelity , and--oh yes--love . \nlike 3 men and a baby , cousins is an americanized version of a french film : 1975's cousin , cousine . \nthe plot is complicated , but it goes something like this . \nlarry and tom are cousins , each of whom is not-so-happily-married . \ntom starts an affair with larry's wife , tish , and to get even , larry and tom's wife , maria , pretend to have an affair of their own . \nsoon the pretending turns to love and cousins is off and running . \ncousins is populated by a wide assortment of interesting characters and caricatures . \nthe acting is first rate down to even the smallest supporting role , and virtually every performance deserves mention . \nted danson ( in his first starring film role ) finally gets to play a character with some depth and sensitivity . \nwhile larry may be confident and charming like sam malone on \" cheers , \" he is also complex and vulnerable , with more between his ears than empty space . \nas maria , isabella rossellini is a joy to watch ; she is shy , sensuous , and immensely alluring . \nsean young is perfectly cast as larry's picture perfect wife , tish , a superficial and trendy make-up consultant . \nkeith coogan , from adventures in babysitting , is wonderfully weird and eccentric as larry's rebellious son , mitch . \nand finally , lloyd bridges in a tour de force performance is mitch's rambunctious grandfather ; he provides some of cousins' best lines and laughs . \nlike moonstruck , cousins is a mix of drama and comedy . \nthe film is larger than life and has a keen sense of the absurd . \nit understands human nature extremely well and milks it for every possible laugh and heart-tug . \nhow often do you see a movie where you believe that two characters truly and sincerely care for and love each other , as friends and as lovers ? \nwell , to its credit , cousins is just such a movie . \nlet's hope the french continue to provide us with the inspiration to make films like cousins \n", "this remake of \" la cage aux folles \" features a gay couple pretending to be straight in order to pull the wool over the eyes of their son's future

where his partner performs as the featured star . \nthey live above the club in what could not possibly be mistaken as a heterosexual abode . \nwilliams is excellent as should be no surprise . \ngene hackman as right-wing potential father-in-law is refreshing in one of his few comedic roles . \nthe real star is lane . \nhis attempted transformation from one of the most obviously gay men in the world to the straight-shooting uncle is hilarious . \nperhaps it is a personal failing on my part , but the crying and screaming drag queen faux high drama just grates on my nerves and the first few minutes of this film are filled with it . \nluckily ( for me at least ) , it doesn't last long and the rest of the story focuses on the relationship between the men , their son and the deception . \nthe question of stereotypes is a touchy one . \nthese guys personify the homophobic gay image . \nyou can almost hear the swishing . \nif you think that they are supposed to be representative of

review is the longest i've ever written and still only scratches the surface . \ni'd recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis . ) \nas my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of `the phantom menace' - how do i even write this review ? \nnever mind the fact that i've been waiting for a new `star wars' movie since i was seven years old . \nnever mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released . \nnever mind that there's so much going on in this movie in terms of plot , action , special effects and long-term story that to analyze every aspect would take a lot of time and energy and still wouldn't cover everything . \nand also like ted does in all of his reviews , i'll try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly to you , the reader . \nbefore we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film , many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered ( to get the specifics of the film , skip this and the next four paragraphs ) . \nas has been made obvious for the last several years , another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the [missing] initial three installments of the `star wars' series ( the first of the films was actually episode four , not one ) . \ngeorge lucas , the creator of the series , has probably just assumed most people know the first-produced trilogy ( `star wars , ' `the empire strikes back' and `return of the jedi' ) is actually the second trilogy , chronologically . \nin media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order , but i can't recall his reasons . \nwith this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy ( err . . . \nsecond trilogy . . . \nwell you know what i mean ) . \nand in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which , unfortunately , may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution . \n[critic's note #1 : it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed , but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule . \ncritic's note #2 : reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics' law of reviewing movies , which as roger ebert coined , `it's not what a movie is about , but how it is about it . ' \nbecause so many outside factors come into play in the film's plot and significance as part of a trilogy , and just considering modern society , it again would be difficult , if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story . ] \nfirst of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it . \nwe know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker , who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire . \nwe know obi-wan `ben' kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of `the force' in attempts to become a jedi knight , but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the `dark side . ' \nwe also know something about `the force' itself , that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it ( the jedi ) . \nwhat we don't know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy , which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth . \nto me , this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle , definite order to all the complexity . \nalso , it seems that we're supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended . \nmost notably , details regarding the emperor from `empire' and `jedi , ' and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine . \nfor those who haven't kept up with all the `star wars' paraphernalia over the years , there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor ( or his voice at least ) . \nwith `the phantom menace' being the first chapter of a long saga , one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid , including the history behind all the major factors of the series , especially `the force' and the jedi knights . \nunfortunately , this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained . \ni didn't liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness . \nif you're going to tell a story from the beginning - tell it from the beginning ( is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes -1 through -3 to clarify the back story even further ? ) . \nbut i digress . \ni've said so much and yet i haven't even touched on the specifics of the film itself . \nall these necessary `disclaiming' elements should go to show just how vast the story of the `star wars' series is and this individual film itself . \nwhat we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three we've come to know and love since the late 1970s . \nits similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar , but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality . \nthe basic story is rather sorted , complex and even confusing at times . \nwe're told that an army known as `the trade federation' has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo . \nwe're not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is , instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly . \nwe're introduced to two jedi , the master qui-gon jinn ( neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( mcgregor ) . \nthe two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planet's queen , amidala ( portman ) . \nthe leader of the federation , an alien called viceroy , is following the orders of a strange , mythical character - an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears . \nhe is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance , and especially that creepy evil voice of his , he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series . \nsidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person . \nclearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity ( which is never openly revealed in the film , but should be clear to most viewers . \ni have a feeling we'll delve into his background in the next two films ) . \nbut it doesn't take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the film's story begins to move along . \nthe film doesn't have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one mini-plot and adventure on top of another . \nthere are so many of these mini-plots-within-plots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook . \nthe other films have relied on this type of storytelling , but because of the limits of the technology at the time , the films' screenplays were also limiting . \nthe sense of limitlessness here is what gives `the phantom menace' its unique traits . \nas we already know , the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original `star wars' trilogy which means a lot of the background which was unclear and/or unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story . \nand here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10-year-old anakin skywalker ( lloyd ) , by qui-gon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council . \nto briefly summarize the story , jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidala's spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation . \ntheir meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force . \njinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force , and through another sub-plot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter , more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves . \nthis also provides for a new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before . \nin fact , it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before . \nthe element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary . \nby the film's third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot . \nit's funny how the reality of the `star wars' world seems so embedded in mythology , new age-like philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence . \nnot that this technique hasn't been used in movies and in real-life situations countless times throughout history . \nand at least it's all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun and exciting matter . \nit does border of the cartoonish sometimes , but that's just the film appealing to our inner child , which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such a big part of our modern society . \n`the phantom menace' delivers exactly what you'd expect from a `star wars' film which is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness . \nso many things in the film we've seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited . \nbut this film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit of sheer fun at the movies . \n", "the story of us , a rob reiner film , is the second movie this fall that touches the viewer in a way they are rarely touched by a film , as they can see their everyday lives in the usually once in a year films . \nwell , 1999 has two of them , the other being the instant classic about a very dysfunctional family , american beauty . \nthe story of us , a film about the highs and lows of marriage and family , is a well written , heartbreaking and insightful film that made the majority of the audience , including myself , cry . \nthe story of us tells the story of ben ( bruce willis ) and katie ( michelle pfeiffer ) jordan , and asks the question , \" can a marriage survive 15 years of marriage ? \" \nthe film is about two individuals who have come together , spent a good chunk of their lives together , and shows when our main characters are \" him \" and \" her \" ( during the bad times ) , and when they are \" us \" ( during the good times ) . \nthe story of us is about their entire 15 years of marriage that is collapsing day by day . \nben and katie now only see and live with each other because they don't want to devastate their children with the fact that their parents no longer , or at least say they don't , love each other anymore . \nben , a cartoonist , and katie , a crossword puzzle writer , have grown apart during their fifteen years of marriage , as they have grown to follow different views on life , family , and marriage . \nkatie is the more organized , sophisticated type , who wants to plan everything out , while ben is a spontaneous , adventurous individual who doesn't mind doing things differently than they were planned . \nthe story of us plays out nicely , as the film opens with ben sharing his story with a therapist , told to the viewer through flashbacks . \nas the film progresses , it switches between ben and katie talking to their therapist , with their stories being told with flashbacks of their marriage . \nthis method is highly effective , as we see the characters changing from year to year , slowly growing apart . \nthrough the flashbacks , we get to see the story of them through both of the character's eyes , and this gives us a strong sense of what their characters are really like , as the story of us has three dimensional , believable main characters . \nthe screenplay , written by jessie nelson ( stepmom ) and alan zweibel ( dragnet ) , is a touching , down to earth work that hits a chord within the viewer , much like another one of nelson's films , stepmom . \nthe script has an open honesty and outlook on life , one that is so realistic , you feel uncomfortable at many times , because so many situations the characters are in are undeniably familiar , as most families these days most go through the hard times , as ben and katie must . \nif it wasn't for the first 15 minutes that the writers wrote , which are rugged and certainly flawed , the story of us would have been this year's best picture . \nbruce willis , a usual action/adventure star , has certainly turned himself around in the past year- he went from being a man who was being typecast to the same role in action movies , to a distinguished , sophisticated actor , as in last summer's the sixth sense ; and now in the story of us , willis shows the world what he can really do if he is fed a good script . \nalthough i wouldn't pick willis as the choice actor for ben jordan , willis handles himself nicely , and shines in a few of the film's most powerful scenes , enough that make his performance a definite contender comes awards season . \nwhere to start about michelle pfeiffer ? \npfeiffer's performance is spellbinding and ultimately strong , as she brings her character to life with such charisma and emotion , you wonder how , how it is possible for someone to portray a real person with such realism . \npfeiffer's performance is one that if not recognized by the academy next spring , will be in the heart's of any viewer that has watched this moving film . \nthe story of us is one of 1999's most real , yet funny films , as the razor sharp script evens out the laughs and the tears to keep the viewer hooked . \nsuperb acting , direction , writing , story , and soundtrack that always sets the mood for the film , which is beautifully composed by eric clapton and marc shaiman , make the story of us a touching , unforgettable motion picture that will touch the hearts of viewers across the country- and will certainly become one of the most talked about movies of the fall . \nthe film's major high points are the fights between ben and katie , as the two constantly accuse of each other of whose fault it is that their marriage has collapsed , and although they also say things like \" it's over , \" or \" i hate you , \" you can tell the two still share a deep connection , and that inside , somewhere , they are still an \" us . \" \nthe bottom line : a wonderful , enchanting , and heartbreaking film . \none of the most realistic , heartbreaking films in recent years . \n", "warren beatty returns to the screens in the funniest , craziest and hard hitting movie in his career . \nbased on a story concocted by himself , and also written by beatty , bulworth gives a good insight of what beatty thinks of the american government system . \nbeatty stars as senator jay bulworth , who's going through a nervous breakdown . \nafter hiring someone to kill him , he completely changes his campaign strategy and tells the honest truth about what's _really_ happening in american politics , much to the annoyance of assistant dennis murphy ( platt . ) \ninstead of everyone hating him , the american public love him . \nhowever , inside his party , more people want to kill him than just the hired assassin . \nand he also strikes a relationship with black girl nina ( berry . ) \nit's remarkable that this film was released at all . \nmuch more open than the rather subdued primary colours , bulworth barely gives the american politic system a good name . \nthe outrageous remarks bulworth makes to his potential voters are very funny , and also somewhat true . \nit's great that beatty isn't afraid to let loose on a subject . \ntalking of beatty , he's excellent in the role of the demented senator , clearing having fun . \nand seeing warren beatty have fun is a rare sight indeed . \neven in dick tracy , he was the most straighten face actor . \n ( then again , he was the only characters face we could completely see . ) \nthe film gives an opportunity for the 61 year old beatty to indulge in some rapping , which he does with gusto ( and also quite well . ) \nand seeing beatty as a 'homeboy' has to be seen to be believed . \nit's nice to see that beatty can laugh at himself . \nsecond best is oliver platt as the flustered , coke snorting assistant , who goes over the top when he finally snaps . \nhalle berry is fine , and sexy , as the intellectual nina , who comes to like the senator . \nalso popping up in the supporting cast is paul sorvino wit h a strange accent , laurie metcalf as the exact same characters she's also played , and christine baranski of cybill fame as bullworths wife , who all contribute to the fun . \nand , this being a political film , the ubiquitous larry king makes an appearance , as , * shock * , himself . \nthe writing and directing , both by beatty , are above par . \nthe direction is very nearly sitcom like , but suits the film perfectly , and both the politics are gangland parts are handled well . \nthe script is funny , and the raps are actually well produced and humorous , and quite clever . \nthey're not cringe inducing , at least . \nthe script makes many points about society in america today , and isn't afraid to make any bold statements about what is a flawed system . \nbest of all , the film is thought provoking , but directed and written in such a way that the film feels as light as a feather , and is very entertaining . \nthere's also a great rap soundtrack with some well chosen tunes . \nbulworth is a film with many advantages , and few flaws . \nperhaps it could be somewhat embarrassing to see a 61 year old man rapping , but beatty does it so well it's irrelevant . \nin fact , there's very little against bulworth , except for the language which is very heavy , but then again it should be expected . \nbulworth , then , is well worth watching . \na david wilcock review ? 1999 \n \" you know , for kids \" - norville barnes \n", "the long and illustrious career of robin williams , which has included both forgettable turns like mrs . \ndoubtfire and flubber , was punctuated with the actor's first academy award in 1998 for his role in good will hunting . \nit was his first truly dramatic role since 1989's dead poets society , and critical remarks were unanimously positive . \nhis next role , that of a deceased pediatrician in what dreams may come , was unfortunately lackluster . \nand so , after a six-year stint as a comedic actor , the proof on whether or not williams can cut it in the dramatic league has come down to patch adams . \nwilliams is the title character , hunter \" patch \" adams , sporting scruffy facial hair that falls between the clean-shavenness of dreams and the grotesque hairiness of will hunting . \nwe're introduced to patch as he commits himself to a mental institution because of his suicidal tendancies . \nit's at the institution , however , that he discovers a latent talent for relating to people . \nhe removes himself from the institution and enrolls at the university of virginia's medical college , where he finds that medical doctrine is a calculating , impersonal trade . \nhis attempts to inject humanity into the profession result in several bouts with expulsion , and the movie climaxes with patch's appearance before the state medical board . \nthe characters are well-defined in an oscar-worthy sense . \nalthough the script does not perform well as a narrative -- there's little story to be told outside of patch's skit-length experiences -- the script does go a long way toward building the relationships of characters . \nat medical school , patch meets up with truman schiff ( daniel london ) , an outsider like himself who relishes patch's zest for humanity . \nthe two instantly become the best of friends , and it's easy to see why . \nmonica potter plays patch's love interest , a young woman who personifies the things that patch hates about medical school . \nfor some reason he's attracted to her , and although it never gets said , the audience understands from an intrinsic point of view . \nthe script -- based on hunter adams' own story -- works well this way . \nthe rest of the cast , bob gunton as the villain professor in particular , is solid . \ndirector tom shadyac ( liar liar ) leads us in and out of patch's life in a sound , intentional manner ; combined with williams' presence on screen , the movie rarely becomes boring . \npatch adams' lack of purpose is its major shortcoming , and for the first ninety minutes out of two hours , there's little feeling of continuity or the passage of time . \nnevertheless , it's an emotionally moving picture , and patch adams looks to be one of the more memorable of the holiday season . \nit succeeds at everything it tries , and only fails at the stuff it doesn't try in the first place . \nby and large there may be another oscar nomination herein for williams , but more importantly , it's entertainment for the entire family . \n", "in recent years , harrison ford has been such a grave screen presence , scowling through the likes of tom clancy's jack ryan series , _the_fugitive_ , and last year's smash _air_force_one_ , that one wonders if the rogue charm that made him such a superstar had been completely drained from his system . \napparently , it was just lying dormant . \nwith ivan reitman's enjoyable romantic comedy/adventure _six_days , _seven_nights_ , the lovable scoundrel is back , giving audiences a fresh reminder of why ford is one of the most enduring and popular modern screen icons . \nford plays quinn harris , a carefree and slightly slobby ( endearingly so ) pilot in the tropics whose broken-down plane crashes in a storm , stranding him and his charter , new york magazine editor robin monroe ( anne heche ) , on a deserted island . \nof course , the sophisticated robin and the salt-of-the-earth quinn are at odds long before the plane goes down , and all manner of hostile repartee is exchanged between the two from their first meeting . \nwhile some of the lines fall flat , the formulaic motions work because of the unexpectedly electric chemistry between ford and heche . \nboth actors , who have largely done serious works as of late , seem liberated by the lack of dramatic weight on their shoulders , and they deliver their zingers , as weak as they sometimes are , with beguiling abandon . \nnaturally , there's nothing like a life-threatening crisis to bring two people together , and quinn and robin's warmup to each other is sped up even further by the arrival of some bloodthirsty pirates . \ngranted , some conflict needed to be introduced on the island , but this tacked-on development from writer michael browning is a bit too obviously thrown in for the purpose of adding gratuitous action scenes . \nbut the point is to get the two together , and their newfound affection causes complications for both , but mostly robin , who came to the islands on a vacation with her fiance frank ( david schwimmer ) , who frantically awaits her return on the home island . \nreitman , and old , reliable hand at breezy comedies , keeps the pace brisk and capably handles the more action-oriented sequences . \nhis big accomplishment , however , is bringing the old , smiling ford back . \nas appealing and charismatic as he always is , ford hasn't been quite this charming and affable in years ; he's obviously having a blast , and the audience cannot help but have one along with him . \nholding her own is heche , whose scrappy character never becomes the screaming ninny she initially promises to be ( as the plane goes down , she frantically pops stress pills ) . \nshe can take her lumps , physical and otherwise , just as well as quinn , making her a formidable foil and ideal match . \nformulaic and light as a feather , _six_days , _seven_nights_ could be cited as a classic example of the summer \" popcorn \" movie season's lack of substance . \nit's certainly fluff , but it's unpretentious , undemanding , and--most importantly--fun fluff that goes down as easily as a frothy pina colada on a balmy tropical beach . \npass the popcorn . \n", "near the end of 1996 , analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king . \nthe following year , 1997 , saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom : twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia . \nat best , that's all it was -- a sleeper hit , designed to surprise but not shake the industry . \nin 1998 , however , things have been decidedly different . \nthere have been a number of pushes on disney's death grip on the market , and fifty-one weeks into '98 , a new champion has emerged . \ndreamworks' the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed . \nthe other two contenders , warner brothers' quest for camelot and disney's own annual entry , mulan , lacked inspiration and drive respectively . \nalthough camelot was borderline-abysmal , and can't really be considered a shot at the title , mulan had the makings of winner . \nunfortunately , it was saturated with traditional , disney-cute animation , and lost points against the rapidly-changing face of the competition . \nin making the prince of egypt , dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a genuinely unique product . \nthe animation is flawless , and , aside from a bug's life , is the best-looking movie to date . \nthe animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects , and the 2d/3d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with . \nthe key to success , however , was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot . \nnamely , some of the most important action sequences ( like the parting of the red sea ) were done almost entirely in 3d . \ndreamworks is the first studio to prove that they've got the stuff of success , and that they're capable of challenging disney . \nthe story is also well-written , and the characters voiced with talent . \nfor the most part , the plot follows its source material -- the book of exodus -- although only in the most general sense . \nthe writers took a few creative liberties , and most do not damage the story in any way . \nin fact , the shakespearean relationship between moses ( val kilmer ) and the pharaoh rameses ( ralph fiennes ) makes the story more interesting if anything . \nmoses , a hebrew , is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile ; he floats into the pharaoh seti ( patrick stewart ) 's palace and is taken in by the royal family . \nmoses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert , where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves . \nby this time , rameses is now pharaoh , and the two brothers , now on opposite sides of the line , face off in a battle of wills and divine intervention . \nthe cast of voices is most impressive , and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock , jeff goldblum , danny glover , and steve martin . \nthe script does not have a lot of one-liners in it , and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams , but overall the story is exciting and interesting . \nit's decidedly for an older crowd , and the tykes who haven't had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost . \nbut for those who make the bid , the prince of egypt can be a great watch . \n", "capsule : a rock and roll fable , indeed . \nlike a hubert selby , jr . novel filtered through equal parts damon runyan and bruce springsteen , and a ton of fun . \nstreets of fire bills itself as \" a rock and roll fable \" , and the description is perfect . \nthis is a stylish , great-looking , and breezily enjoyable movie that feels like a hubert selby , jr . , novel with a damon runyan rewrite , irected by bruce springsteen . \nnoir is one of the few truly american movie genres , aside from the hollywood musical and the western . \nthis is post-wwii brooklyn noir , for lack of a better label , with a generous injection of rock 'n roll and an all-around confrontational attitude . \nit all works . \nthe plot is simplicity itself : rocker ellen aim ( diane lane ) is kidnapped by a vicious street gang , led by a bloodthirsty fellow named raven ( willem dafoe , very nasty ) . \nher old soldier flame ( played by michael pare ) comes back into town to save her , but doesn't count on a whole bunch of things going askew . \nthat's about the entire plot , save for the spats with ellen's manager ( a hilarious rick moranis ) , an encounter with a doo-wop group that winds up becoming ellen's supporting act , and a whole gang of other fun little touches . \nbut in movies like this , when is the plot important ? \nthe movie is all style , all visuals and attitudes , quotable lines and posturing -- and it delivers all those things consistently and with great brio and pacing . \nno surprise that it was directed by walter hill ( 48 hrs . ) , who understands this kind of macho romanticism perfectly , and has put together a movie that's a mixture of times and sensibilities , but perfectly unified in tone . \nwhen was the last time you could say something like that about a movie , especially a movie where it seems like someone gets decked on the jaw ( * and * passes out ) every 2 . 63 minutes on cue ? \nstreets of fire isn't the greatest movie ever made , but it occupies a totally unique little niche , and enjoys the position it has . \nanyone with a weakness for doo-wop , neon , motorcycles , rainy streets , the el , studebakers , gang pictures , lonely heroes , and a great-looking gal giving the microphone both lungs will eat this movie up . \ni did . \n", "jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities , but whom you end up liking anyway . \nin as good as it gets , the character in question is melvin udall , a successful novelist with obsessive-compulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible , except when he feels like being a royal pain in the you-know-where . \nhe's mean . \ni mean really mean . \nthe opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium . \nevery day , melvin eats at the same cafe , sits at the same table , and gets served by the same waitress . \nyou can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance , when his waitress carol ( helen hunt ) tells him he can just go sit in another section , and all the other waitresses just cringe . \none day , melvin makes a comment that goes to far , and carol , genuinely hurt , comes down on him like a ton of bricks . \nat that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course , but is also the only person who can get to him , too . \nanother person who often crosses melvin's sights is simon ( greg kinnear ) , an artist who lives on melvin's floor . \naside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city , simon has the added benefit of being gay , making him a prime target . \nsimon's friend frank ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , also gay , does not fare much better . \nwhen simon walks in on a pair of men robbing his apartment , he is brutally beaten and sent to the hospital , and frank , who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor , intimidates melvin into watching after simon's dog while he convalesces . \nthis is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage . \nan interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in : melvin gets to like the dog , and the two develop an attachment which is the catalyst to melvin's softening up to the world around him . \nit doesn't happen overnight , but throughout the film , he bites his tongue here , cares a little there , and most miraculously , falls in love . \none of the best elements of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others . \nhe's traveling terra incognita here , and it shows . \ngood performances are turned in by all principal players in this film , especially by nicholson and hunt . \nthey play well off of each other and have a genuine chemistry which makes it a pleasure to watch them on screen . \ngreg kinnear , who is becoming known for his supporting film roles , is also very good at playing the vulnerable simon . \nhe gives a short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist , and delivers it with such inspiration and conviction that you actually get to feel some of what he feels . \ncuba gooding jr . performs with a hyped-up level of energy which contrasts nicely with that of kinnear , and comes through with a near constant comic performance . \nthe screenplay , by mark andrus and james l . brooks , is clever , touching , and funny . \nthe best part about it , however , is that it is filled with characters we care about because they are actually interesting . \nmelvin is a man we can't quite figure out , but whose mannerisms and quirky qualities capture our attention . \ncarol is a working woman living with her mother , trying to take care of a child with a debilitating respiratory problem . \nsimon is a man who is a success in his circle of peers , but who is still not accepted by much of society . \ncombined with the talent of the actors , these characters make the film . \nthe one noticeable area where the film is lacking , however , is the absence of cuba gooding , jr . through the second half . \nhis character makes an exit which is supposed to be temporary , but the film ends before his return , leaving his relationship with simon and melvin unresolved . \ni would have liked to have seen more of his character in general , in addition to a part in the film's conclusion . \nthere's one actor , who will probably not be recognized by any awards , but who contributes greatly to many of the movie's best scenes and who deserves mention . \nthis is that little dog . \nhe plays such a pivotal role to melvin's character development , actually serves to forward the plot , and has some absolutely scene-stealing moments , that it is hard to believe he is simply an animal . \naward or no , however , when even the dog puts in a good performance , you know you've got an outstanding movie . \n", " \" i've been told by several people , 'you're old fashioned . \nyou want to do everything by hand , ' \" topiary gardener george mendonca complains ,

possibly have to do with the other . \nwhat morris manages is something akin to an intellectual magic trick , an interrogative sleight of hand . \none of the things that feels different about an errol morris documentary -- besides the always-striking visuals -- is the interview style , where subjects seem to look directly at the viewer . \nweary of pressing his cheek against the camera lens to get this effect during conversations , morris developed an elaborate double-camera gadget he calls , half-jokingly , the interrotron . \nthrough a rig that uses a pair of teleprompters to project video images of the interviewer for the subject and vice versa , these folks talk , startlingly , right to the camera -- to the video image of morris , and by extension to the audience . \nthe gardener wonders whether , after his death , anyone will be interested in maintaining the garden that he's devoted half his life to tending . \nthe robot scientist is more than a little pleased to note that his creations may be primal examples of what an insect or even an animal is -- a complicated set of sensory receptors . \nthe mole rat specialist is delighted to catalog the ways in which these vermin animals behave like insects , and notes that they may be more suited to long-term survival than people . \nand the circus trainer pines for a long-lost ideal that was exemplified by world-renowned trainer and showman clyde beatty , who starred in such serials as zombies of the stratosphere ( excerpted at some length here , with affection ) . \nstarting to detect the patterns ? \nfast , cheap & out of control contains a multitude of parallels and tiny intersections , culminating in what feels like an elegy ( the film is dedicated to morris's late mother and stepfather ) . \nthe film is balanced on that airy precipice dividing the already musty past from the alternately exhilarating and terrifying space that is the future . \n ( the title is taken from brooks' wish that nasa would send a payload of hundreds of expendable robots to scurry about the martian surface , creating a sort of road map for the terrain -- fast , cheap , and out of control . ) \nwith able assists from editors karen schmeer and shondra merrill and cinematographer robert richardson ( oliver stone's longtime collaborator ) , this becomes a cinematic contraption that's a wonder of narrative divergence and coherence . \n ( further enhancing the picture's wacky intellectual mood is the playful score by alloy orchestra founder caleb sampson . ) \ndifferent story threads inform and comment on one another with the serene inscrutability of a kieslowski film , or a surrealist dream . \nby cobbling together out of these motley musings a thesis on the nature of craftsmanship , invention , and existence itself , morris reveals the presence of cosmic themes -- creation , evolution , death -- in earthbound lives . \nat the same time , and just as significantly , he pays tribute to a consuming passion for one's work . \nthis breakdown of the dichotomy between the everyday and the extraordinary is likely as profound as anything you'll encounter in pop culture this year , and the visuals cry out for the big screen . \ndon't miss it . \n-------------------------------------------------------------- directed by errol morris edited by karen schmeer and shondra merrill cinematography by robert richardson music by caleb sampson u . s . , 1997 -------------------------------------------------------------- \n", "the deer hunter , directed by michael cimino , is truly one of the greatest movies ever made . \na captivating drama about the lives of a group of friends from a small russian-american pennsylvania community , the deer hunter promises to be one of those movies that you will never forget . \nin this academy award winner for best picture of 1978 , outstanding performances are turned in by all actors , and cimino's brilliant directing provides the perfect vision into the character's lives . \nthe first act of the film provides us with an inside look into the lives of a group of men from a small community who work and hang out together . \nmichael , portrayed perfectly by robert de niro , is shown early on as the natural leader of the group . \nafter a days work , the men leave their jobs at a factory to head down to the local bar , where john ( george dzundza ) works . \nthree of the men , michael , steven ( john savage ) , and nick ( christopher walken ) will be leaving shortly for vietnam , but not before steven gets married . \nafter the marriage , the group , including axel ( chuck aspegren ) , spend one last day on a hunting trip , one of their favorite past-times . \nthis sequence of events enables us to view the lifestyle of a normal group of men , who will be suddenly and permanently affected by the ravages and separations of war . \nthe wedding scenes , although criticized by many as being quite long , actually enhance even more the purpose of the first act . \nthe outstanding performances by de niro , walken , streep , savage , and cazale , who died very shortly after the filming of the movie was completed , really begin to shine through and promise not to halt in the near future . \nthe second act of the movie begins with the trio of men on the front lines in vietnam , stationed in a south vietnamese village being attacked by the viet cong . \nthe men are eventually captured and held in a floating prison on a river . \nthis prison , run by the v . c . , \ninitiates the horrifying scenes in the movie , where the prisoners are forced to play russian roulette against each other . \nsteven , who is emotionally marred by this turn of events , is secluded in a tiger cage with water up to his face when he refuses to participate . \nmichael shows his leadership again by convincing nick that the only way that steven will survive is if the two friends play against each other , and moreover , they must play with 3 bullets in the gun . \npersonally , i felt that de niro's absolutely gripping portrayal really was displayed in a brilliant way in these and the following scenes . \nthe men are eventually able to escape , but are separated . \nmichael is able to get steven , who ends up losing his legs , to medical care , while nick finds his way to saigon and a u . s . army hospital . \nmichael returns home and does not feel at all like a hero . \nhe wants to avoid the celebrations and recognition that his friends would like to bestow upon him . \nhe assumes that nick is still lost in vietnam . \nthe third act concentrates more on walken's character , who eventually stumbles upon a small gambling operation where the game is , again , russian roulette . \nonly in this game , you play for money . \nmichael has learned that nick is possibly still alive and returns to saigon to attempt to find him . \nthe two narrowly find each other at the russian roulette games , but do not link up until michael discovers nick participating in the games and tries to bring him home . \na very emotional , and , for many , a very disturbing movie , the deer hunter is a truly magnificent movie that should not be missed . \nthe greatest performances possible are turned in by all actors , and cimino's directing , which is considered to be at his all-time best in this film , is equally dazzling . \ndo not miss this film , it will captivate and astound you . \n", "with storytelling this compelling , who needs books ? \nbased on the book by author james ellroy , l . a . confidential is probably one of the best piece of work produced by hollywood in recent years . \ntogether with director curtis hanson ( the hand that rocks the cradle , the river wild ) whom ellroy corroborated closely throughout the shooting of the film , resulted in a movie with a plot and and script so tight , an atom would have to squeeze itself through . \nset in the 50s , the story revolves around 3 policemen of vivid personalities . \njack vincennes ( spacey ) is the cop who is more concerned on busting with fame and stardom ala hollywood style , concentrating heavily on work which will attract him media attention . \nthere is also the young hot-shot rookie , ed exley ( pearce ) , fresh out of the academy and all-out to carve a name for himself in the footsteps of his legendary cop father . \nthe tough and unnerving bud white ( crowe ) , a cop who believes in justice , the swift and violent way . \n3 policemen , distinct in their characters and paths but all of them working in a place where there is no real distinction between good and evil . \nwhen his partner is murdered on the day of his resignation , bud sets out to find the people responsible but unwittingly delved himself into something more than just a simple robbery murder . \neven after exley receives a promotion for his work on the murder case , happenings began to link itself to the murder . \nthe 3 eventually reach a point of convergence when what actually began as a personal investigation turns out to be an uncovering of a complex web of organised-crime in hollywood . \nthe last time i remember a film so clever and compelling was when i watched the usual suspects . \nin l . a . confidential , you do not get the shock and cleverness as the former but it has a lot more of `story' going for it . \nthere is not a single moment in the film in which i felt was slow at all . \nsurprisingly , though spacey did a very convincing job as the street-wise vincennes , the movie was carried mostly by the two rather `unknowns' , pearce and crowe . \npearce's exley is cool and calculative in his actions and there is a slight hint of val kilmer in his appearance . \ncrowe's bud white is the most impressive of all ; head-strong and temperamental , he should obtain some sort of recognition for his work here . \nsuperb acting . , wonderful storytelling and one of the best climaxing gunfights ever . \neasily the best hollywood piece for 1997 . \n", "synopsis : committed to an asylum , the marquis de sade ( rush ) continues to publish pornographic literature , aided by young maid madeleine ( winslet ) . \nabbe coulmier ( phoenix ) , who runs the hospital , disapproves of the stories , but humours him in the hope of achieving a cure . \nde sade's craft and life are threatened when the emperor dispatches dr royer-collard ( michael caine ) to stop the marquis' work , permanently . \nreview : \" quills \" is an exploration of the marquis de sade : his madness , his cruelty and his perversion , his obsession with sex in any form , no matter how obscene . \nbut \" quills \" also details the marquis' determination : to write in spite of the obstacles put in his path , and to propagate his words to the masses . \nthe extent to which de sade is willing to go to practise his trade is amongst the movie's most intriguing elements , as when de sade scribes a story in his own blood , or narrates a tale via of a chain of fellow inmates , cell to cell . \nto provide a contrast with the marquis , wright involves him with two very different characters . \none is the abbe , a handsome , charming and kindly man whose desires are stymied by his oath to god . \nthe abbe lusts for madeleine , but it is the wizened marquis who is able to have her . \nand then there is royer-collard , a hypocrite who in truth is as sadistic as any of the marquis' motley creations . \nrush is splendid as de sade , utterly inhabiting the character . \nkaufman's direction is fine , and he is able to bring a sense of bizarre humour to the grim proceedings . \nthe plot itself is rather mundane and plays out unsurprisingly , but this is virtually unimportant . \nfor two hours , \" quills \" acquaints us with the marquis de sade -- and , more frightening still , allows us brief insight into his scatological soul . \n", "with more and more television shows having gay characters , and even the infamous \" ellen \" sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian , the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines . \nthe birdcage was critically acclaimed , as was this years chasing amy . \nthen along came in & out , and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released . \nit's also noticeable that this \" alternative lifestyle \" becomes less and less taboo as the years go by , and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort . \nwhile it's a very serious issue to many , it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety . \nbut the way we're using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically . \nwhile the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh * at * , it is more and more becoming something we laugh * with * , and when a movie like in & out comes along , it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy . \nit doesn't poke fun at the lifestyle , it simply uses it to all it's comedic capacity , just as love , sex , marriage , birth , death , and anything else has been . \nthe idea for in & out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids-afflicted gay man in philadelphia . \nif you remember , during his acceptance speech , hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community , and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life . \nit's a serious and touchy subject , but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy , and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick . \nit's true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual , it may have been more controversial , but because it was written by an openly gay writer , the prerogative was set . \nkevin kline , who only seems to become more and more acclaimed , stars as howard brackett , a high school english teacher in the small , picturesque town of greenleaf , indiana . \nafter a three-year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery ( joan cusack ) , a wedding date has been set , and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story - greenleaf high graduate cameron drake ( matt dillon ) is up for a best actor oscar . \nthe small town eagerly awaits both events , and both seem quite astronomical , but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other . \nwhen cameron drake is announced the winner , the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher , mr . brackett . \neveryone is cheering back in greenleaf - that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words , \" and he's gay . \" \nthe town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop . \nthe thing is , nobody , including howard , can understand how cameron came to that conclusion , and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf . \nnaturally the questions pour from howard's fiancee , parents ( debbie reynolds & wilford brimley ) , students , and the high school's principal , tom halliwell ( bob newhart ) , and the evidence starts to become more and more obvious : howard is clean , neat , honest , sincere , a romantic , and perhaps the most incriminating fact , he loves barbara streisand . \nthe frenzy isn't helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and \" entertainment tonight \" wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning . \none particular reporter is peter malloy ( tom selleck ) of \" inside entertainment \" , who unlike the collage of other reporters , wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett , including coverage of his wedding . \nthe intrusion is all but welcome by howard , who is going more and more out of his mind with each passing minute . \nit seems that no matter where he turns , a camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees . \nthe dominoes begin to tumble as howard's closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay . \nit all sounds very devastating , and it would be if it weren't presented with near-perfection by one of this year's most delightful ensemble casts . \nkline seems only to improve with age , and he is downright perfect here . \nthe great thing about this film is that every single character has a moment to shine , and they use it wonderfully . \nevery single actor turns in one of their best performances ever . \ndillon has never been so likeable , cusack has never seemed so perfect for a role , and brimley , reynolds , and newhart all provide huge laughs when they're up to bat . \nrudnick's script is heavily laced with wit and humor , and you'll likely find yourself laughing out loud for a solid ninety minutes . \nwhile in & out doesn't carry enough to give it four stars , it remains one of the best done films of the year , all-around . \nthe script is exuberant , the actors are absolutely top- notch , and we're allowed just the perfect blend of heart-tugging so as not to bog down the laughs . \nit remains a solid comedy throughout its entirety , yet we're still allowed a sappily touching ending . \ndespite it's subject matter , and one scene that comes almost too close for comfort on explaining gay sex , this is a movie that everyone could , and should , enjoy . \nfrank oz , best known as a voice talent for muppets , directs this film quite delightfully , using all the potential rudnick's script has to offer , which turns out to be quite a bit . \ncheck this one out . \nyou'll have a gay old time . \n", "with his last two films - shine and snow falling on cedars - australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there , and his latest , hearts in atlantis , is no different . \nits structure - beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle - is similar to the green mile , which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books . \nthe parallels don't end there , either . \natlantis was adapted by william goldman , who had previously penned the big-screen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for king's dreamcatcher . \neven the film's content is a bit reminiscent of mile . \nin fact , it's the perfect blend of the feel-good '60s nostalgia of stand by me ( also by king ) and mystical power hokum of mile . \nking's atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories , but the main focus here is on the first ( and longest ) tale , called low men in yellow coats ( the film's title comes from the second chapter ) . \nit's set in 1960 harwich , connecticut , where 11-year-old bobby garfield ( anton yelchin ) lives in a boarding house run by his cold , self-centered mother elizabeth ( hope davis , joe gould's secret ) , who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son . \nbobby spends his time with his two closest friends , john sullivan ( will rothhaar ) and tomboy carol gerber ( mika boorem ) , who become something like the kevin , paul and winnie of harwich . \nwhen a new tenant moves into the vacant room , the fatherless bobby finds a male role model in ted brautigan ( anthony hopkins , hannibal ) , a mysterious stranger who is vague enough about his past to make bobby's mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror . \nted teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature ( after his cheapskate mother gives him a library card for his birthday ) , dispenses prophetic words of wisdom and even pays bobby one dollar a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the low men , a group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers . \ni won't go into what these powers are , but they're considerably toned down from the book ( and don't involve black stuff flying out of ted's mouth , a la mile ) . \natlantis' present-day setting which bookends the film is based on the novel's final chapter , titled heavenly shades of night are falling , and features david morse ( in yet another connection to the green mile ) as a married , middle-aged bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his formative years . \natlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks' cedars , which is disappointing but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson to the occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski , the oscar-nominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowski's red . \nthe acting is solid from everyone , including hopkins , who never once makes you think of dr . lecter . \nmost impressive are youngsters yelchin and boorem , who both had tiny parts in along came a spider . \nwhile i didn't really have much of a problem with goldman's screenplay , i do need to point out at least one inconsistency . \ngoldman , for those of you who don't read premiere , writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody else's films , carefully explaining why they all suck , make no sense and insult their audiences , while somehow failing to mention the crap that he's penned ( like the general's daughter ) . \nit's mean-spirited but fun to read , mostly on account of nobody else in hollywood having the balls to say anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business ( including michael jackson , o . j . \nand robert blake ) . \nin atlantis , which is supposed to be told through the eyes of young bobby , one would assume he would have to be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back . \nwell , he's not , and it doesn't make sense . \n1 : 41

the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \non december 20 , 1996 , amidst all the year-end oscar bait releases from the major studios , miramax's genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream . \nalthough the teen horror market had been given up for all-but-dead in recent years , the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns , eventually topping $100 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history , while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre . \nthe sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry -- suddenly , everybody was looking for hip , inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes . \nthe strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost . \nscream director wes craven , previously best known as the creator of new line's a nightmare on elm street film series , was thrust back into the limelight . \nand scream's rookie scribe , kevin williamson , burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion . \nit's hard to understate this last point . \nmr . williamson has , based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing ( scream , i know what you did last summer from october 1997 , and now scream 2 ) , enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame , quickly become the most well-known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly-reading , box office figure-watching youth culture since -- well , since that quentin tarantino guy ( whom , it is said , has also achieved some renown as a director ) . \nindeed , in a singularly freakish oddity , it is the screenwriter , mr . williamson , and not the director that has been receiving the lion's share of acclaim for the success of scream , and the print advertisements for scream 2's theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence : while the traditional \" a film by wes craven \" drapes the film's title in the ads , right below it ( in equal sized font , yet ) reads \" written by kevin williamson \" , an affirmation of the screenwriter's contribution to the project which may be unprecedented . \n ( i can envision the board of wga , licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of \" a film by \" is attained . ) \nand , much like mr . tarantino's screenwriting , mr . williamson's work is vaguely unconventional , incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters . \nin scream , they satirically discussed other horror films ; here in the sequel , the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels . \nscream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood , and mr . williamson's rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel . \nwhile the sequel was planned from the outset -- a treatment of scream 2 was included when mr . williamson sold the screenplay for scream -- the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived , and it's only at about the film's midway point when it becomes engaging . \nlike its predecessor , scream 2 opens with a splashy , eye-grabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the film's principal narrative ; this time around , we're following the exploits of a young couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab ( a running film-within-a-film gag where the \" true life \" events behind the first film has been turned into a movie ) . \nhowever , although it tries hard and has some good ideas -- the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with , and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overly-noisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes -- the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore ( where her performance not only convinced me that she * could * act , but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that i've ever seen ) . \nthere are too many knowing , hip pop-culture references crammed into the scream 2 sequence , and the setup isn't nearly as cleverly frightening as scream's ; while the first film's preface dizzyingly built up to a final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying , the payoff here is almost campily theatrical . \nflash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college , where returning characters sidney ( neve campbell ) and randy ( jamie kennedy ) have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film . \nthe murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors -- single-minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) roars into town to cover the breaking story , while ever-awkward former deputy dewey riley ( david arquette ) flies in to protectively guard over sidney . \nthey're joined by cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film ; his role here is significantly expanded . \nthe film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory , although i suppose a good case can be made that it really isn't necessary -- not because so many people have seen the first installment , but because this is , after all , a sequel to a slasher film : what do you * think * happened to these characters in the prior movie ? \nthere's a lot of new faces on the scene too : sidney's new boyfriend , derek ( jerry o'connell ) and her new roommate hallie ( elise neal ) , randy's fellow film student mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , gale's newly-assigned nervous cameraman joel ( duane martin ) , omnipresent local journalist debbie salt ( laurie metcalf ) , co-ed cici cooper ( ms . buffy herself , sarah michelle gellar ) , and a pair of simpering sorority sisters ( rebecca gayheart and sirens' portia di rossi ) . \nany of these characters could be the killer -- or for that matter , could be the next victim . \nas is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay , the narrative is once again framed around the increasingly-flimsy premise of a whodunit . \none problem that scream didn't have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer . \nhere ( and to some extent in i know what you did last summer ) , mr . williamson's screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery . \nthe film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements . \n ( it doesn't help matters any that the killer's alter-ego is fairly obvious from the get-go . ) \nindeed , the finale plays as full-out camp when the villain is finally unmasked , frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes . \nthis is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations , scheming , and motivation , that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it . \nwhile the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived , the aspect where it's head-and-shoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences . \nthey're staged much more imaginatively here ( save for the first post-prologue murder , which is handled in such a mediocre , conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable 1980s slasher flicks that the first film satirized ) , and are much more fun to watch . \nit's hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck , and a cat-and-mouse chase involving gale and dewey in a campus sound lab is very nicely staged , although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown . \nin terms of its characters , the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey ( who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music ) . \ntheir verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour -- an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is well-written -- and there's a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed . \non the other hand , sidney is pretty dull here . \nshe doesn't have any compelling presence , and there's nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than that she's the returning heroine . \ngiven this , and the fact that there's no strong second banana character for sidney ( elise neal's role isn't nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowan's shoes ) , it's no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film . \nwhat surprises me the most about scream 2 is its zealousness in decimating its cast . \nthe film's mounting body count bears out the fact that * no * character is safe ( well , * almost * ) ; while in principal i applaud this bold policy , at some point you've got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel . \n ( i was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular , whose casting for the next installment of the series would've seemed obvious . ) \nbut hey , as rose mcgowan's character said in the first film : \" no , please don't kill me , mr . ghostface -- i want to be in the sequel ! \" \nlook what that got her . \n", "note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \nit's startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth . \nthe lion king had just cracked $300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history , continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast . \nsince then , though , disney's animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns , with pocahontas , the hunchback of notre dame , and this year's hercules successively proving less and less potent . \nwith the once seemingly-impregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable , and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from fox's anastasia , disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation , the little mermaid . \nwhile the animation for the film is , as is typically the case for disney films , unquestionably top-notch , the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation , but the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music . \nthe film's storyline is fairly straightforward -- young teen falls for handsome man , father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter , teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man -- except in this case , the chaperone is a crab , the teen is a young mermaid , and the object of her desire is a human prince . \nwhat makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions . \nfrom the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric , she's resolutely smitten , and she's such a pure and endearing character that one can't help but invest their heart with her . \nthis simple but touching love story , coupled with a healthy dose of smart humour , makes the little mermaid a remarkably captivating picture . \none of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it : the voices cast for its motley crew of characters . \nthis film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue , which started to a certain degree with beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams' much-heralded turn in aladdin ; by the release of the lion king and henceforth , the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities . \nwhile it's understandable that animated features lacking the name-recognition or drawing power of disney ( say , balto's use of kevin bacon and bridget fonda , or even anastasia's showcasing of meg ryan and john cusack ) would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products , it's unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy . \ndo we really need to hear , say , demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame ? \nis the film's entertainment value really augmented by hearing a recognizable voice , rather than a voice which best suits the role ? \n ( i'm not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan . ) \nfortunately , the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid , although perhaps more obscure , are impeccably cast . \nchief among them is jodi benson , a 1992 tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you , who voices the film's heroine ariel to perfection ; with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor , and gorgeous singing voice , ms . benson provides a most engaging anchor for the film . \n ( she's the only reason i'd even consider catching flubber . ) \nsimilarly , samuel e . wright is terrific in the showy role of sebastian , the weary guardian crab . \nhe easily milks his lovable character's comic moments for all they're worth , and his rendering of two of the little mermaid's big tunes -- \" under the sea \" and \" kiss the girl \" -- have become the stuff of legend . \npat carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil sea-witch ursula , while kenneth mars' booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of ariel's father , king triton . \nin large roles and small ( edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal , and rene auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant french chef ) , the little mermaid is impeccably cast . \nof course , the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team of alan menken ( music ) and howard ashman ( lyrics ) , who had created little shop of horrors and would go on to compose beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before mr . ashman's untimely death . \nnot only are mr . menken's tunes unbearably catchy , but mr . ashman's charming lyrics are fully integrated into the film's storyline so that the songs are a virtual extension of the character's dialogue , and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film . \nmr . menken's score for the film is equally top-notch ; the sequence where eric ( voiced by christopher daniel barnes ) and ariel tour his kingdom in a horse-drawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with mr . menken's fine score . \nit appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypso-styled \" under the sea \" as joyfully crooned by mr . wright , which won the academy award and golden globe awards for best song -- indeed , one of the many little joys in screening the film during its re-release was listening to children scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune -- but my favourite is ms . benson's heartfelt rendition of the ballad \" part of your world \" , an achingly beautiful tune of yearning and hope ( wonderfully lyricized by mr . ashman ) which , accompanied by the film's most dazzlingly polished animation sequence , packs an emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes . \nduring the song's reprise , which builds to a crescendo with ariel arching on a rock as a wave crashes in , the cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking , and one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is one of the finest in animation history . \nas of this writing , november 1997 has come to an end , as has disney's limited 17-day re-release of the little mermaid . \nthere's no question that the primary motivation for , if not the film's reissue itself , at least its timing , was to reinforce disney's dominance in the animation market and provide direct competition to fox's costly new upstart animation division and their first major venture , anastasia . \nin every respect , the re-release of the little mermaid appears to be a success -- the film's 1997 grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic $100 million mark ; the little mermaid proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video , pulling in close to $10 million in its opening weekend ; and although nobody could possibly expect the little mermaid to possibly defeat the aggressively-marketed anastasia in head-to-head competition , it siphoned enough from the fox film's opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot , allowing for disney's odious flubber to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away . \nbut although disney's motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were self-serving and protectionist , the real winner is the public . \nany reason to put this film back into theatres is a good one , and it's a true joy to see this heartwarming gem back on the silver screen . \nthe little mermaid is the best film to come out of the disney's modern animation renaissance , and one of the greatest animated films ever made . \n", "this christmas , little ralphie parker ( peter billingsley ) wants nothing more than a red ryder bb gun under the tree . \nalthough cautioned by many that he will ? shoot his eye out' , ralphie remains optimistic , conjuring up a detailed scheme to get on the good side of his parents and teachers . \nit could be possible that no one has ever wanted anything with more passion than ralphie wants this bb gun , and the story of his eternal struggle is a charming one . \n`a christmas story' is a favorite among many during the holiday season , and boy , it is certainly easy to see why . \nralphie's endless desire for the bb gun may transport you back to your childhood , when you were craving a certain gift for christmas and the anxiety was almost indescribable . \nevoking pleasant childhood memories is only one of the many things `a christmas story' does so well . \nhere are a few features that make this film such a charming little package for everybody during the holiday season : \n1 ) period detail . \nthis film is based on the memoirs of late humorist jean shepard , who shares his experiences as a young boy living in the 1940's with loving detail . \nshepard narrates from a first person point-of-view , divulging his various adventures one snowy december , in which visions of taking aim with his new bb gun replaced that of sugarplums dancing in his head . \nshepard's first-hand commentary of several situations is not only downright hilarious , but also witty and warm , with various metaphorical meanings that ring perfectly with the essence of comic timing . \non top of that , young billingsley's stupefied reactions to each predicament is absolutely perfect in contrast with the narration . \ndirector bob clark captures the look and feel of the era with wonderful technicality . \ni can hardly imagine a more accurate depiction of what christmas for young ralphie must have been like . \n2 ) mom and dad . \nboth melinda dillon ( as mom ) and darren mcgavin ( as ? the old man' ) are perfect in their roles . \nit's hard to fathom a more agreeable pair for the requirements of a story like this one , with each possessing at least one memorable trait that instantly separates them from the wooden caricatures that could have been featured . \nfor instance , he is a bloodthirsty turkey hound , and she is forgiving and understanding when it comes to some serious issues . \nin portraying the writer as a persistent but mild-mannered young lad , peter billingsley has struck quite the chord . \nhis performance is richly textured , making all of the humorous situations he stumbles into radiate with flavor and enjoyment . \nwhich brings us to . . . . \n3 ) the comic situations . \nthere are plenty of memorable moments in `a christmas story' . \nmoments that undoubtedly will improve in comic potency upon each new viewing , with so much more to explore and to cherish . \ni am particularly partial of the ? f-word scene' , in which ralphie blurts out the shocking four-letter obscenity while helping the old man in the yard . \nagain , shepard's method of handling this amusing scenario is nothing short of comic wizardry . \nthe numerous sequences that stick in one's mind include , of course , the famous department store santa scene - in which billingsley has some problems in telling old saint nick what he wants under the tree . \ni could go on , but i'll finish on this note : `a christmas story' is a standout among holiday movies , because it captures so much in a meager 90 minutes . \nnot only is it funny , it's often genuinely hilarious . . . . not to mention warm , fluffy and touching in all the appropriate places . \ni plan on making `a christmas story' a christmas tradition . \nwhy don't you ? \n", "in intolerance , d . w . griffith told four different historical stories at the same time , cutting from one to the other . \neach of the stories builds to a fast-paced climax . \nin magnolia , paul thomas anderson tells several stories each just tangentially connected to the others . \nyet the stories and where they are going are all independent . \nwhat is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized . \neach story builds to a tense moment ( or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment ) but then lets the tension dissolve . \nwhile the tension dissipates one character starts singing a song and in each plotline the major characters sing along , even though they are not in the same scene . \nthen toward the end the stories each build to a tense moment again . \nit is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked . \nthis creates some strange effects . \nthe stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships . \nthe strands have varying degrees of bizarre content . \nwe have the story of a dying man earl partridge ( jason robards ) wanting to get in touch with his son and make amends . \nphil parma ( philip seymour hoffman ) is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge achieve his final goal . \npartridge's young wife linda ( julianne moore ) is getting more and more anxious as partridge dies , but for an unsuspected reason . \nfrank mackey ( tom cruise ) runs the kinds of self-help seminar that businesses like so much , but he aims his at teaching disaffected men how to be real shit-heels in dealing with women in an angry backlash to women's lib . \nofficer jim kurring ( john c . reilly ) is a patrolman who has a need to feel he is making the world a better place . \njimmy gator ( philip baker hall ) hosts a popular children's tv quiz show that really exploits and destroys children as we see from the stories of current quiz kid stanley spector ( jeremy blackman ) and former quiz kid donnie smith ( william h . macy ) . \nthe film juggles all these stories for over three hours , but even after all this time not one story is resolved satisfactorily . \neach story moves toward a single bizarre common climax , but it is not one that seems to do much but derail each story . \nthe common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to really tie up any of the stories . \nthe film seems to be built around strange events and weird history , but it really has little to do with the content of the stories , though they all are connected in part by one weird event . \nmagnolia will probably bring some much deserved attention to paul thomas anderson , though in my opinion his two previous films , hard eight and boogie nights were better told stories . \nit is interesting that one starts to look forward to actors from anderson's company . \njohn c . reilly seems to be a standard fixture . \nparticularly notable is philip baker hall who gave a mesmerizing performance from the first scene of hard eight . \nhere he several of the characters are mesmerizing , but that characteristic is not really used . \nas studies of characters these stories are each worth following . \nas well-rounded stories with a beginning , middle and end , they leave something to be desired . \nbut the film is willing to do the unexpected and that helps make the film worth sitting through . \ni rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . \nheavy spoiler . . . \nheavy spoiler . . . \nheavy spoiler . . . \nheavy spoiler . . . \nduring the strange climactic event of the film we get multiple messages from the filmmaker that the event we are seeing really does happen . \nand in actual fact , it does . \nsince biblical times rains of frogs have been interpreted as signs of displeasure of the gods . \nit is , however , a perfectly natural , if somewhat unnerving , phenomenon . \nthe cause is associated with whirlwinds . \nwe know that tornadoes over land can rip up land and even objects of some size from the ground and hurl them into the air , holding them aloft . \nthe reader may remember the unfortunate cow in twister . \nsmaller objects can be hurled high into the atmosphere and then be kept aloft by the updrafts for surprisingly long periods of time much as hail and chunks of ice are . \nwhen the whirlwind is over water , animals near the surface , frequently fish and frogs , may suffer the same fate . \nessentially they are vacuumed up by the whirlwind , held aloft by updrafts , and finally dropped elsewhere . \nso while the rain is possible , some doubts do creep in . \nthe rain of frogs depicted in this film may be of greater scale than i had pictured for a rain of frogs . \nit seems unlikely the frogs would still be alive when dropped . \nit is not clear that geographic conditions are right for los angeles to have this sort of phenomenon . \n ( frankly i have no idea on these points . ) \notherwise the event was quite believable . \nwhat we see in this film is much more credible than the phenomena we saw in volcano . \nin the film it is left ambiguous if the rain is a sign from god since there are many references to exodus 8 : 2 . \n \" and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people , and upon all thy servants . \" \nhowever a rain of frogs , though it feels biblical , is most definitely not a biblical portent . \nnote that the previous verse says \" and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up . . . , \" \nso the bible is referring not to a rain but to an infestation from the river . \nthe only other reference to frogs in the bible is as a symbol for uncleanness in revelation 16 : 13 . \n", "contact is the 1997 movie i've seen the most - five times to be exact . \nfour of those times were on the big screen , but even on a tv , it's a very impressive film . \nthe same can't be said for films like independance day , but that's because contact is a rare example in sci-fi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects , and all of us know looking back that id4 didn't offer much outside of some one-time delightful eye candy . \ncontact's wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) , a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of \" merely listening \" to sounds out in space . \nher interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age , encouraged by her loving father , ted ( david morse ) , who let ellie use a small ham radio to pick up on frequencies and communicate with people as far away as pensacola , fl ( that was , of course , before the days of internet chat rooms ) . \nwhile everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence ( of which the program seti is an acronym for ) , ellie prefers to pop on a pair of headphones and see what she can pick up on , keeping the youthful magic and intrigue strongly alive . \nellie's strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist , a belief likely influenced by the death of her father while she was still quite young . \nin puerto rico , she meets palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a writer examining the effects of technology on the world's overall happiness ; a one- time seminary student who describes himself as \" a man of the cloth , without the cloth \" . \ndespite the vast differences in opinion regarding a \" supreme being \" , ellie and palmer hit it off , and even take the time to sleep together . \nit's a weak and hurried relationship , but director zemeckis needs it to add to the plot later on . \nmeanwhile , dr . david drumlin ( tom skerritt ) , who has authority over seti but finds the program a frivolous waste of time and money , is ready to pull the plug on any and all seti funding . \nthis leaves the passionate ellie searching for new sponsors , eventually finding a setup in new mexico and leaving palmer with no explanation , and only a one night stand to remember . \nit is in this nm city where , several months later , ellie finally picks up on a strong signal from outer space , perhaps the most profound discovery in the history of science . \nwhen the signal is closely examined , many new developments spring up , and before long , drumlin is stepping in to take over the operation he once scoffed at . \neventually , it is concluded that information in the signal may be blueprints for a transportation device used to teleport an earthling to vega ( where the signal seems to have originated ) . \nthe media swarms , fanatics go further off the deep end , scientists clamor for new information , politicians huddle in discussion of appropriate actions to take , and presidents are morphed into a celluloid reality ( remember when zemeckis couldn't get enough of this in forrest gump ? ) . \nas if that weren't enough , ellie's discovery leads her to the nation's capital where she again runs into palmer . \ncontact is based on the novel by carl sagan and deals heavily with the subject of science vs . religion . \nthe impressive thing is how well both aspects are presented , with no signs of bias . \narguments for both sides are intelligent , solid , and thought-provoking . \nwhen palmer joins a selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega ( of which ellie is a leading candidate ) , personal convictions play a more important role than love interests . \nthe question is , can a person who doesn't believe in god truly be the best representative of earth when 90% of the planet * does * believe in a higher power ? \neven when the film wraps up , it's uncertain whether it's meant to play as an advocate for religion , science , both , or even neither , and in our modern day society where \" right and wrong \" is only opinion ( at least speaking \" politically correctly \" ) , the ambiguity is an incentive . \ndon't get me wrong . \nas much as it sounds like it , contact isn't merely a theology class rolled into a reel of film . \nit's a * highly * enjoyable two and a half hours . \ndespite its seemingly heavy issues , it's not a tedious undertaking to watch this film . \nthe special effects are outstanding , though ( warning ! ) \nhighly depreciated on the small screen . \neven so , some of the subtle visual effects ( that will likely go unnoticed by many ) are even more impressive than ones more recognizable as \" sci-fi \" . \nthe storytelling is rich and complete , and although there are moments in the film that feel quite pretentious ( and at times , even hokey ) , it's easily one of the best 1997 films , and one of the best sci-fi films i've ever seen . \nthis is zemeckis' best since back to the future , and for those of us who actually know that forrest gump was astronomically overrated , zemeckis now has real reason to boast . \n", "roberto benigni is a clown in the tradition of chaplin and keaton . \nthis italian film star , best known in the united states for the poorly received son of the pink panther , has done the near impossible by creating a comic fable about the holocaust . \nbut benigni's life is beautiful ( la vita e bella ) is not so much a story of the holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as a backdrop to tell a story of familial love , devotion and sacrifice . \nthe movie starts out as a typical slapstick farce with benigni's guido arriving in the small tuscan town of arezzo in 1938 to fulfill his dream of owning a bookstore . \nlike many of the slapstick clowns who preceded him , most notably the almost-forgotten harry langdon , benigni's guido has a childlike innocence . \nhe ignores the growing anti-semitism of the fascist government . \ninstead , guido ardently falls in love and persues dora , a local school teacher who already is engaged to a local fascist official . \nin benigni's tightly wound script this is the same fascist official with whom guido had an earlier unfortunate - yet slapstick - encounter . \nguido wins dora . \nthey marry . \nfast forward about five years . \nguido , dora , and their 5-year-old son , giosue ? ( giorgio cantarini ) are a happy family . \nguido has finally fulfilled his dream of opening a bookstore . \nbut racial and anti-semitic tensions are on the rise in italy , and guido has determined to do his best to shield his son from these harsh realities . \nthe task becomes even the more difficult when the family is deported to a concentration camp . \nhere , guido must use all his skill and imagination not only to shield his son , but to keep him from being exterminated . \nit is at this juncture in life is beautiful may tend to offend those whom the holocaust has touched . \nfor the scenes in the concentration camp lack the horror , the pain , the unimaginable suffering of a schindler's list . \ntrue , many italian jews were not deported until the war was nearly over , and most were not sent to the death camps , but to work camps where they were used as slave labor . \nunlike steven spielberg , benigni is not out to tell the story of the holocaust . \nhis story is about family and the lengths a parent will go to protect a child . \nfor guido , to save his son , transforms the entire experience into an elaborate game . \ngiosue ? must follow the rules without question to amass 1 , 000 points . \nthe winner takes home a tank . \ntherefore , guido tells him , he must remain hidden in the barracks . \nhe cannot make a sound nor allow the guards to see him . \nguido explains this during a hilarious sequence when a german guard barks the camp instructions to the newly arrived inmates . \nguido , lying that he understands german and can translate for his fellow prisoners , instead lays down the rules for his son to allow him a chance to survive . \nthroughout their imprisonment , guido's quick thinking continually keeps his son from harm's way . \nultimately , the allies rescue the camp . \nin a poignant scene , giosue ? comes out of hiding just as an american tank rolls into the compound . \nthe boy goes wide-eyed with wonderment and delight , thinking he has won the game . \nthe price for his victory is most high . \nbenigni has succeeded in using the blackest moment in human history to prove that even in hell , a ray of hope and salvation can penetrate the darkness . \nlife is beautiful is a fantasy , a fable . \nit is not to be taken as a record of the holocaust . \nthose who object to it are missing its point . \nand that is simply where there is hope , where there is life and where there is love , the spark of humanity will never be extinguished . \ncommitted to lifelong learning through effective communication \n", "larry flynt is a self proclaimed smut pedlar and the owner/publisher of the multi-million dollar hustler publications company . \nthe people vs . larry flynt is the story of larry flynt's fight for the freedom to circulate and sell his pornographic magazine , hustler . \nbased on a true story , the film is almost a documentary in that it's a very vivid and detailed look at larry flynt's life . \nwoody harrelson gives an excellent performance . \nhe conveys flynt's peculiarities and his character with depth and focus . \nby the end of the film the audience actually finds themselves , somewhat grudgingly , liking larry flynt . \nthis is some feat given flynt's apparent lack of any morals or ethics and his extremely smutty and childish behaviour in court . \nhowever , flynt has a number of things going for him , he's rich , he's funny , and most importantly , he says exactly what he means . \nlarry flynt's wife , althea leasure is played by courtney love . \nlarry meets althea at one of his clubs , and they fall in love ( a very sexual and open love ) . \nboth of them indulge in a world of too much sex , and eventually too much drugs . \nflynt had been taking an excessive amount of

to stop taking drugs , althea does not have any such plans , nor the determination to follow them . \nas the film progresses we see her become increasingly frail and sick . \ncourtney love obviously

flynt's lawyer , alan isaacman . \nagain , this is a solid performance . \nthe audience finds it easy to sympathise with isaacman who somehow puts up with flynt's courtroom antics . \nflynt is not only childish in the courtroom , but downright rude to the judges , and lands himself in a lot of trouble ( and even in a mental institution ) because of it . \nisaacman is very easy to like , and great at proving ( in quite clever ways ) his points to the court . \nmilos forman has done a great job in directing the people vs . larry flynt . \nit is not really an exciting or thrilling film ,

worlds have been coming one after another . \nthe most popular and original of them all has been the matrix . \nall the films released after it , have been less successful . \ndavid cronenberg's existenz , released only a couple of months after the matrix , was accepted and even appreciated ( by some ) , but the hype was gone . \nand when 'the thirteenth floor' aired this fall , it was completely overseen and ignored . \ni admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying , feeling like eating the same meal over and over again . \nit was therefore i was less than excited , when i went out to see to 'the thirteenth floor' . \nhowever , i was positively surprised by josef rusnak's latest picture . \nmatrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality , combining the best of hollywood's action and effects with an intelligent story . \nexistenz was a violent , gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality , ending in blood and madness . \n'the thirteenth floor' is somewhere in between . \ninstead of going after the crowds - the action audience ( like the matrix ) , or aiming at the horror fans ( like existenz ) , 'the thirteenth floor' presents a more intelligent plot , witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience , that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding . \nin a near future . . . on \nthe thirteenth floor of a classified building , a genius scientist , hannon fuller , has created a simulated world , his personal dreamworld , where every inhabitant is a complex , selflearning program that only believes it is real . \nright after the first testing of this world , fuller ( ) is found murdered . \ndouglas hall ( ) , his closest friend and business partner , immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth . \na beautiful woman ( gretchen mol ) who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery , which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence . \nthe first \" download into simulation \" is impressive . \nit is the creator's first visit to his world , his creation . \nin order to enter this virtual universe , you have to take over someone's identity , become another person . \nthis is called conciseness transfer , and this is part of the tragedy in the film : people \" wake up \" in unknown places and strange things start happen . \nthey start to doubt in their own sanity . \nthese innocent people pay for the mistakes of their \" users \" and

that they are puppets in someone's fantasy . \nwith an appealing ( \" blade runner \" - type ) of detective story , this film presents the beauty and possibilities of virtual reality and the lurking danger that is always present . \nour modern world is metal and glass -- cold , unfriendly , impersonal . \nthe thirties are different -- colorful , beautiful , elegant , virile . \nthis contrast

answered , but posed in an intelligent manner . \nthe visual aspect of the film is one of the key elements , since it portrays the contrast between these computer-simulated universes . \nkirk m . petrucelli has done a marvelous job with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour , grace and color ; and setting this world in opposition to our own -- an almost caricatured recreation of the nineties . \nthere are some honest and decent performances by an almost unknown cast and harald klose's moody musical score that is at in right place at the right time . \na rather unusual thing about'the thirteenth floor' is the almost complete lack of special effects . \nthere are no cgi animated creatures , no bullets in slow motion . \nthis is a more philosophical approach , reminding about the european way of filmmaking . \nthis is off course a major disappointment to the audience that is used to endless gunfights and mutated amphibians , but the more serious science fiction buffs and 'dark city'-fans will be pleased . \nthis film is interesting and inspiring . \nit has everything existenz doesn't , but it lacks the immediacy and intensity of the matrix . \nand then there is a happy end which , like in 'dark city' , completely alienates it from the rest of the story and context . \nthe plot itself is not as original as the filmmakers want us to think , since they have virtually sucked out all information from the best science fiction classics , including blade runner and 'dark city' . \nwith this in mind , 'the thirteenth floor' doesn't make an oscar candidate or a film that will be remembered a year from now , yet this is a beautiful , elegant and intelligent take on virtual reality . \n", "i don't know what movie the critics saw , but it wasn't this one . \nthe popular consensus among newspaper critics was that this movie is unfunny and dreadfully boring . \nin my personal opinion , they couldn't be more wrong . \nif you were expecting airplane ! -like \nlaughs and agatha christie-intense mystery , then yes , this movie would be a disappointment . \nhowever , if you're just looking for an enjoyable movie and a good time , this is one to see . \nhonest , it is . \nthis story is about a 4th network , wbn , taking to america's airwaves in 1939 . \npenny henderson ( mary stuart masterson ) , the station owner's secretary , must deal with her overbearing boss , an unimpressed sponsor and writers ready to quite on a moment's notice , partly due to the fact that they haven't been paid in weeks . \namong the mayhem , she must also deal with her soon-to-be ex-husband , roger ( brian benben ) who desperately wants her back . \nunfortunately , her problems only get worse as the night goes on and the body count rises without explanation . \nwhile trying to woo penny back , roger must deal with the police and try to find the killer that lurks at wbn . \nmary stuart masterson does well in her role as penny ( i'm trying to be unbiased so i won't tell you how amazing she looked ) , although brian benben gets most of the screen time . \nalong with the two leads , are several recognizable faces , including corbin bernsen ( l . a . \nlaw ) , michael mckean ( laverne & shirley ) and bobcat goldthwait . \nthe special effects are amazing , and fooled me ( which some may argue isn't very difficult to do ) in many scenes . \nalthough the movie sometimes goes overboard with the physical comedy , it more than makes up for those mistakes throughout the movie . \noverall , i gave it , or an , depending on what system you use . \nsome comments collected from friends : \n", "it was with great trepidation that i approached +mary+ , the farrelly brothers+ latest film . \ni knew the film would be funny--the trailer alone had me laugh harder than the actual comedy i went to see . \nbut i also knew the film would be an equal-opportunity offender , attacking the sensibilities of the politically correct with reckless abandon . \ni figured the film would be raunchy , maybe another lucky escapee from nc-17 hell . \ni may laugh , but would i feel better in the morning ? \ni needn+t have worried . \n+mary+ is the sweetest , warmest , all-out laugh-and-grossfest this side of _animal house_ . \nsurprisingly , the farrelly brothers have walked that very tight line of making a touching romantic comedy on the side , and filling the details with five or six outrageous howlers . \nthey make laughter , the toughest job for a filmmaker to do , look easy . \nthe plot is typical . \nthirteen years ago , geeky ted ( ben stiller ) lucked out in having dazzling mary ( cameron diaz ) go with him to the senior prom . \nas luck would have it , on that very day , he was hospitalized . \nwhy , i shall not tell , but i assure you , it isn+t pretty . \nhe hires a private investigator to find her : pat healy ( matt dillon ) . \nhe becomes one of the great comic villains . \nupon finding her , he too is lovestruck , and so pursues her , lying about his occupation and getting his teeth capped . \nit is only a matter of time before ted finds out that he had been double-crossed , and goes to get her for himself . \nwould the geek get the girl ? \npuh-lease . \nthe ending is pure hollywood ; no surprises there . \nbut the absolute joy in this film is how this simple premise allows for humor in zippers , hair gel , the mentally disabled , the physically handicapped , interracial marriages , homosexuals , skin conditions , serial killers , tanning , and drugged-up dogs . \nthe dog on speed sequence alone is worth the price of admission , and belongs in the film comedy hall of fame . \nand yet , for all the targets that are hit , the film maintains its sweet tone . \nmary , playing the straight role , is as sweet and caring as she is beautiful . \nshe is totally devoted to caring for her mentally handicapped brother , warren ( w . \nearl brown--miles away from the cameraman in _scream_ ) . \nmary+s sunniness carries the film here--it compliments the below-belt gags that come at you . \ncameron diaz makes her totally charming , and the audience respects her , even though women in general do not usually undress before an open window . \nben stiller also fares very well , totally changing his image from his _reality bites_ and _flirting with disaster_ straight men to being a , ( how to say it ? ) , a complete loser . \nbraces , greasy long hair , not too bright , and very very funny . \ndillon is exceptionally creepy , especially with his capped teeth . \nand rounding out the cast is ted+s friend dom ( chris elliot ) , tanning addict magda ( lin shaye ) , modern troubador/greek chorus ron lichman , and mary+s sweet mom , markie post ( where has she been ? ! ) . \nnot everything works . \nchris elliot+s role , skin blemishes and all , becomes merely tasteless and boring . \nthere+s lousy dialogue about eight-minute vs . seven minute exercise tapes . \nand there are long stretches without much going on . \nbut the wait is worth it . \nwhen those extraordinary sequences hit , the entire theater erupted with howls , tears . \nbelly-aches , that in some sequences carried over to the following scene . \nthe farrelly brothers have finally done it . \nyes , there are some raunchy bits , but when it is all over , it+s not nearly as bad as it could have been . \nwhile tasteless , it didn+t cross any lines , at least not with me . \nwhile raunchy , it wasn+t nearly as bad as _porky+s_ or _boogie nights_ . \nand it is sweet enough to be considered a date flick . \nafter the funny but sour _kingpin_ left a negative aftertaste in my palate , comes the funniest sex farce since _a fish called wanda_ . \napproach this with an open mind , and you will reap the benefits hugely . \n", "a standoff . \na man holds a woman , a diplomat's daughter , hostage in his embrace , a gun pressed to her head . \na cop , impaired by drink due to his wife's philandering , trains his gun on the man's nether regions , threatening to shoot . \nanother cop holds his gun to his partner's temple , forcing him to disarm . \nthe scene unfolds like a foursome bidding in bridge--upping the ante , signaling tacitly , going for game . \nthe second cop retrieves the first cop's weapon , the suspect lowers his , and the woman caught in the middle moves--in slow motion--to safety . \nit is then that the intoxicated officer makes his move , grabbing for the assailant's gun . \nthe room turns upside down , a shot rings out , a cop is down . \nshot in the back and paralyzed for life . \nthe young man who found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time is sent to prison for six years for a crime he didn't commit . \nstorytelling has always been one of pedro almod ? var's greatest gifts and in \" live flesh \" he gives us a twisting , turning , compelling tale peppered with well-written , colorful characters . \ncharacters who find themselves , more often than not , in carefully-constructed scenes like these . \ncharacters played by actors we might not know , but who look strikingly familiar nevertheless . \ntake the ruggedly handsome victor plaza ( liberto rabal ) , for instance . \nbefore he gets out of prison he could easily be mistaken for that almod ? var favorite , antonio banderas . \nwhen we first meet elena ( francesca neri ) , the woman in the middle of the nervous shakedown , she looks like spice girl barbie with her frizzy shock of orange hair , but later tones down her look sufficiently to pass for juliette lewis . \nelena's husband david ( javier bardem ) is the cop crippled in the shooting and he wears david schwimmer's bemused expression throughout . \nplaying the inebriated cop and his cheating wife are jos ? sancho and angela molina--no lookalikes spring to mind , but they round out the excellent cast . \nit's a credit to almod ? var's craft that these five individuals cross paths and intertwine with such credulity . \n \" live flesh \" begins and ends with a live birth and the film's contradictions come almost as often as the contractions . \nbetween the two childbearings , coincidence , irony , and a hefty dollop of sex form the key elements of this thoroughly entertaining film . \nalthough based on a ruth rendell story , \" live flesh \" is brimming with the acclaimed spanish director's high-heeled flourishes . \nwomen are at times alluring and repulsive , their extravagant hairdos and animal print coats providing colorful highlights to the intricately-woven drama , an eye bruised by an abusive husband here , a mouth bloodied by an impromptu delivery there . \nwhile in prison , victor learns bulgarian from an inmate and learns to love the bible , quoting from deuteronomy thereafter not unlike the way by which david and sancho refer to themselves as \" guardians of a sick flock . \" \nvictor's pre-fab inheritance is a shambles in a slum resembling sarajevo . \n \" dear son , i got cancer \" his mother writes to him in jail . \nshe dies before he is released and it's at the cemetery that victor is reacquainted with elena--redemption , ultimately , substituting for revenge . \n", "with stars like sigourney weaver ( \" alien \" trilogy ) and academy award winner holly hunter ( the piano , raising arizona , etc . ) together in a single hollywood production , one would immediately identify the film as a potential academy award hot shot . \nsadly for copycat , though tightly scripted and nicely plot , is still at heart , a typical hollywood thriller . \nhelen ( weaver ) , after a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer , darryl ( harry connick jr . ) , has developed a phobia for being outdoors , so to speak . \nincidentally , helen is also an expert on the subject of serial killers , which make her a juicy target for serial killer wannabes . \na year has passed and strange deaths begin to terrorise the city of san francisco . \ndetective monahan ( hunter ) and getz ( mulroney ) , baffled by the unorthodox methods of killing used by the killer , seeks the professional help of helen , who , as expected was reluctant at first . \ncopycat \" borrows \" a lot from silence of the lambs and in most cases , it did work . \nbut copycat tries to be a little bit more by immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters to give them more believability , this was rather unnecessary as the scenes seem to disrupt the mood of the entire film and also . . . \nmuch of the time wasted could've been used to build up the suspense and injected with drama . \neven so , weaver and hunter act very well in their own departments . . . \nweaver being the vulnerable yet strong-within character ( as in aliens ) and hunter being the short , tough , texan speaking cop ( as in raising arizona ) . \nharry connick jr . , a very good jazz singer , shines as the imprisoned serial killer a la hannibal lecter . \nwhich comes to the moment of judgement ( drum roll please . . . ) . \ncopycat is a good thriller . \nalthough the plot is highly predictable and one can actually predict the rest of the movie after about 45 minutes into the show , copycat survives from the moments of anticipation where the audience are held on to their seats , in anticipation of the killers next immediate move . \nthis worked pretty well and will offer audiences a couple of unexpected jolts . \nnice movie to bring your girlfriend to . . . . \n", "no , it is not a bad film , in fact it is so good in achieving its purpose , i actually wished for the film to end itself quickly . \nevent horizon is not your run-of-the-mill sci-fi film , i'm sure many who have watched this will agree with me . \nit is not even original in that sense , and it does borrow heavily from films like alien , hellraiser and even blade runner . \nthe magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and methodical build-up that makes it wonderfully horrifying . \nthe story brings us to the year 2050 , where space travel have since enormously progressed . \nthe event horizon is actually a ship built for a secret experimental purpose ; it has the ability to fold time and space thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a man's lifetime . \nthe ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation but after 7 years , it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune . \na search and rescue team led by miller ( fishburne ) is given the task to check for survivors of the event horizon . \nthe designer of the ship , dr . weir ( neill ) follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship . \nevent horizon is a sci-fi horror film , much truer to the word than say , alien would ever be . \nwhile in alien , the crew has to cope with a ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces , in event horizon , the forces which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful and horrifying . \nthe story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup is superb , up till the point where i really felt like saying out loud `enough ! \ni can't stand this anymore ! ' . \nthere are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime . \nthe story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also , the acting is only at most , average by most commercial standards . \neven so , the essence of horror is carried out very well in this film , thanks to its well-paced storytelling , disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences ( which incidentally , has been quite generously removed by our censorship board ) . \ndirector paul anderson ( who did mortal kombat ) and his team of `atmosphere' creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term `horror' . \nthis picture did not do very well in the us box-office most probably for the dread-factor impact it has on most audiences ; people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this . \nalthough on the face of it , event horizon is mostly molded for mass-entertainment ; many thrills , spills and suspense to keep audiences in focus . \nhowever , the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing . \nmy friend and i could not say a word to each other for quite a while after going through the `experience' of event horizon . \ni guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film had cast upon us . \nbe forewarned , this film is not for the faint-hearted nor for pure entertainment . \nbe prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch this film ! \nevent horizon is highly recommended ? ? but at your own risk ! \nit has been a long time since good-horror embraced the big screen , and event horizon is one . \n", "capsule : earthy , experimental , difficult , shockingly frank ( even for 1997 ! ) , and ultimately refreshing story of a black man on the run from the cops . \nthe first few minutes of sweet sweetback's baad asssss song ( yes , i checked -- that's the correct number of ss ) are without dialogue , just eerie montages of sounds . \na young boy , obviously malnourished , is taken in and fed up by several loving mother-surrogate figures . \nthen one of them takes the boy to bed for a sexual initation ( underneath the title credits ) that's far more confrontatory and shocking than any ten basic instincts -- probably because it has the directness and clumsiness of real life , something we're not used to seeing on screen . \nthis is one tough movie to swallow , no matter who you are , but that probably reflects more on how pallid and unchallenging movies have gotten lately . \n ( i suspect the sex scenes in movies like el topo and salo would probably melt the synapses of most modern audiences . ) \nthe plot is simple but not simpleminded . \nsweetback , hassled by two white cops who are apparently just looking for an excuse to beat up on a black man , breaks his bonds and runs like hell . \nalong the way he moves through a good many of the kinds of environments that we are only just now being seen in a more serious light in the movies -- or at all , for that matter : the slums , the missions , the ghetto . \nin other , lesser , movies , sweetback would be machine-gunning everything in sight and the end credits would roll over a pile of bodies ; in this one , we get taken on a kind of a tour of the depressing and anarchic world that sweetback takes for granted . \nssbas first appeared in 1971 and was promptly rated x ( \" by an all-white jury \" , as director melvin van peebles crowed in his legendary ad campaigns ) , and it's hardly surprising why . \nthere's a good deal of sex in the movie , but it's handled in a way that's unsettlingly frank -- a frankness that spills over into the rest of the movie . \nin one scene , sweetback visits a friend's house in the hope of getting sanctuary there , and the other man chats him up while on the toilet . \nwe're not used to coming this close to people in real life , let alone in the movies -- especially not people who are not made out to be glamorous . \nthe movie is also full of experimental stylistics that are relatively unused today , but probably because of that seem curiously fresh and new in van peebles' hands . \none scene , in which a man is interrogated by the cops , is loaded full of menacing energy as they fire off a gun inches from his ears , and suggest his deafness through a cleverly edited soundtrack . \nanother note : ssbas is not so much anti-white ( that would be too easy ) as anti-authority , and as the movie goes on to demonstrate , authority exists in many forms -- governments , churches , and even the paranoid inside of one's own mind . \nssbas is ultimately about thirsting for freedom -- and it looks like we could use a little more of that in our movie diet , god knows . \n", "a fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july ! \ni didn't really expect very much when i rented stuart saves his family . \nthe movie bombed at the box office , and i had never really liked the saturday night live sketch on which the movie was based . \nmy real concern , though , was the general reputation of snl-related movies translating to the big screen with less-than-stellar results ( half-baked , anyone ? ) \ni was surprised to discover a truly entertaining , often hilarious yet also touching little film . \nit is an al franken production through-and-through , who not only created the title character but also wrote and starred in the picture . \nfor those of you who don't know , al franken plays a guy named stuart smalley , who has a really annoying show on a public-access station about increasing your self-esteem , etc . although not a licensed therapist , stuart smalley is , as the program proudly boasts , \" a graduate of several 12-step programs . \" \nstuart is doing well enough with his tv show , but he keeps getting distracted by family troubles . \nstuart's relatives are a mess : his dad and brother ( harris yulin and vincent d'onofrio , respectively ) are alcoholics , his sister is overweight and getting over another divorce , and his mom is in constant self-denial and solves all perceived problems by baking . \nthen , disaster strikes . \nstuart accidentally insults the manager of the station and gets his show revoked . \nhe is forced to move back in with his family after he can no longer support himself , and there the comedy truly picks up . \nfranken wrote all of the characters not just as cliches or stereotypes , but as sharply-drawn , real people . \nalthough smalley's dad has always imbibed too much , stuart can still recall times when his father seemed like an okay guy . \nalso , after an accident towards the end of the movie , both stuart and the audience learn that there is more to his mother than previously thought . \nalthough filled with small , very funny scenes , stuart saves his family also has its share of dramatic moments , especially towards the conclusion . \nfor a lightweight comedy , it handles these scenes especially well , often better than many so-called \" serious dramas \" of today . \nall the more amazing is that such a movie comes from a saturday night live sketch that is essentially a one-joke bit . \nif you feel like renting a comedy , and you haven't seen this film , i definitely recommend you try this one out . \nyou'll laugh . . . you'll \ncry . . . . it's \nall there . \n", " \" oh my god , i sounded just like a mother ! \" \nmrs . pascal , played with devilish wickedness by genevieve bujold , tells her son . \n \" didn't i sound just like a mother ? \" \n \" you are a mother , \" her son marty tells her disgustedly . \n \" i know , but i still can't believe it . \ni look at you people and wonder , how did you ever fit in my womb ? \" \nmarty , you see , is a grown-up twin . \nalthough his sister , who thinks she is jackie-o , is certifiably insane , marty fits right in with the rest of this highly dysfunctional family in the witty black comedy the house of yes . \nmother and daughter , played in a brilliant performance by parker posey , are both varying degrees of wacko . \nmost dysfunctional families in the movies are more angry and mean-spirited than diabolically abnormal as this one is . \nthe daughter's fantasy of being jackie-o is probably the most sane part of her being . \nmrs . pascal is the sort that will not let jackie-o keep a hairbrush downstairs since food is kept on that level . \nshe explains to marty's new fiancee , lesly ( tori spelling ) , soon after their first meeting that jackie-o was holding marty's private part when she came out of the womb . \nthe dialog by wendy macleod , based on the play by mark waters , is so sharp and biting that it seems in danger of cutting through the celluloid at any moment . \nthe script , reminiscent of a david mamet play , flows smoothly with its fast paced intelligence and mesmerizing set of bizarre characters . \nthe exaggerated setup has lesly and marty arriving at the family's out of the way mansion during a thanksgiving day hurricane . \nin this storm are two sane individuals . \nthe fiancee is a giddy , school-girl type , embarrassed by everything , a complete contrast to her rival jackie-o's bitter pseudo-sophistication . \nas the two twins' younger brother , anthony , freddie prinze jr . plays the all-america boy type whose only foible is his explicit obsession of bedding his brother's fiancee that night . \n \" we all have our secrets , \" jackie-o tells her potential sister-in-law , and boy , does she have a few . \nthis is a house filled with them . \n ( when lesly calls it the family's \" home \" to mrs . pascal -- they've never had a visitor before lesly -- mrs . pascal becomes discombobulated until she realizes that lesly is talking about their \" house . \" ) \nin a film that gives new meaning to the phrase , \" made for each other , \" the twin's biggest , but not their only secret , is that they've had a long-term incestuous relationship . \nthey don't like to discuss it , although they are not particularly ashamed of it . \nperfect for viewers who can appreciate perverse comedy , this story never pulls its punches . \njackie-o tries in many ways , few subtle , to show that she is a better match for marty than that ditzy fiancee of his . \nin one scene marty and lesly are playing chop sticks together on the piano when jackie-o pushes her aside and starts playing a challenging classical piece for four hands . \nmarty joins her as his fiancee looks on with envy . \nthe chemistry between parker posey and josh hamilton is nothing short of amazing . \nthey put down their little brother and most of the other sane people in the world . \ntheir ripostes are engaging filmmaking at its best . \ndirector mark waters keeps the show's energy level high and lets the leads sling zingers at each other at a furious pace . \nhis crisp direction ensures the movie has nary an ounce of fat on it . \njackie-o is temperamentally incapable of being nice . \nand being jealous , she cuts lesly down mercilessly . \n \" were you poor ? \" \njackie-o asks her when she finds that lesly committed the crime of growing up impoverished . \n \" did you eat pies ? \nchicken pot pies ? \" \n \" pancakes actually , lots of pancakes , \" lesly replies with her usual sincerity . \n \" a donut king , so is she like the queen ? , \" \njackie-o cattily inquires of marty when she learns that lesly works at a donut king . \n \" are we entertaining royalty ? \" \nwith rolfe kent's whimsically sinister music it never seems clear where the story is headed . \nwill it end in a big emotional explosion , a murder , people slowly cutting each other up with words , a familial catharsis , a weather disaster or what ? \nthe emotionally charged play is clearly going somewhere , and the engaging characters captivate the audience with their spell . \ni'll not say more except that the ending is perfect and a bit of a surprise . \nthe house of yes runs a blazing fast 1 : 25 . \nit is rated r for sexual situations and conversations , mature themes , violent overtones and some profanity . \nthe movie would be fine for older and mature teenagers , i . e . , treat the movie as it were rated nc-17 . \n", "i don't know how many other people have had the idea cross their mind that their life could be an ongoing television show watched by another world of people , but it's something i used to wonder about when i was younger . \ni can't decide if i first thought it because i watched a lot of tv or because my brother hit me in the head with a baseball bat , but i'm pretty sure andrew niccol , screenwriter for the truman show , has had the same curious thought . \nthe truman show is about a man ( jim carrey ) whose entire life has been engineered by a corporation and marketed to the public . \nsince birth , he's been living in the fictional island town of seahaven , fla . , which actually exists as a giant domed set just beyond the hollywood sign . \nall the people in truman burbank's life are actors , and the anonymous townfolk paid extras . \npeople watch truman's life 24 hours a day , live , with no commercial interruptions . \nrevenue comes instead from product placement , a staple of contemporary hollywood , with truman's friends and relatives describing their consumer items in cheerful and optimistic tones . \nthe sun rises and sets on cue and everyone likes everyone else . \neven if you haven't seen the truman show , you've probably learned most of the crucial details from the commercials , the trailer and other promotion blitzes . \nif anything i've written so far is a surprise to you , then i pity you for making me a primary source for your entertainment news . \neither way , you should probably know the premise of the truman show going into it , because otherwise you'll probably think it sucks . \nit begins with jim carrey looking into a mirror , reciting the crucial \" eat me \" scene from alive , wishing his neighbors a good day , afternoon and evening , and living in domestic bliss with his wife ( laura linney ) . \nbut weird things start happening . \na stage light comes falling out of the sky , truman hears people tracking his movements on the radio and he swears he sees his dead father . \nwe learn through a flashback that his father drowned when truman was a child , sailing through a rainstorm . \nthe death was staged by director christof ( ed harris ) , who wanted to put a fear of water into truman to keep him from leaving the island . \nsimilar cruel manipulations keep him from stumbling upon the truth , not the least of them truman's best friend marlon ( noah emmerich ) , who assures him he's not in on any conspiracy because the last thing he'd ever do is hurt him . \nas truman's trusting eyes tear over , christof fades up emotional synthesizer music for a worldwide audience of people who apparently never watch anything else . \nthere's even a daily behind-the-scenes update from harry shearer that captures the highlights of truman's existence . \nthe key to a movie like this is in finding the right balance between humor and drama , because a premise like this has its obvious implications in both directions . \nand it all hinges on carrey , who has to balance comic naivet with a real sense of longing and drive to find out what the hell is going on . \nhe's come a long way from talking butt cheeks in ace ventura . \nmost fundamentally , it's just plain interesting to follow along as director peter weir shows us just how they can capture a person's life without the person realizing it -- how they coordinate extras , hide cameras and feed automatic lines to actors . \nthe most interesting thing about the truman show is that most of us can probably imagine some ambitious director pitching a show like this . \nsure , the most interesting tv genre of the '90s has been reality programming and jerry springer's popularity is through the roof , but those people deserve to be humiliated for turning their intimate details over to the airwaves . \nand when news shows use hidden cameras , it's done in the name of the greater good , not entertainment . \nbut merge the two and you've got the truman show . \nright now , it's implausible -- i mean , the fcc won't let you say the s-word on the air ; do you think they'd let you broadcast every detail of a man's life to the entire world without his consent ? \none day , though , it could happen . \nand , even though it would mean the end of privacy , people would eat it up . \nyou know they would . \n", "no filmmaker deconstructs a story as well as atom egoyan . \ni'm referring , specifically , to the narrative form . \nin the sweet hereafter , egoyan tells his story in a similar framework to his exotica or the adjuster . \nsaid story , of a fatal school bus accident in the small town of sam dent , british columbia , that shatters the morale of the locals , is told in a most unstraightforward manner . \nwhen the film opens , the accident has already happened , and stephens ( the wonderful holm ) , a polite ambulance-chaser , has arrived with the promise of a lawsuit that will eek out the truth of what really occurred that fateful morning . \nthroughout , we get to meet the parents of the dead , broken souls who follow stephens like \" the pied piper \" ( passages of which are read during the film ) . \nbut there is one living passenger , the paralyzed nicole ( polley ) , whose dark secrets of a life before the accident may affect her decision to testify . \nwe finally do see the accident , about three quarters into the film , which is a stunning visual effect . \na horrific long take that shows the bus sliding , then stopping , then collapsing into a frozen lake , is the best digital trickery in any movie this year and , perhaps , ever , in a motion picture . \nthe fractured narrative also intercuts a preoccupied stephens on an airplane , traveling to meet his hiv-positive runaway daughter , as well as glimpses of the artificially happy lives these people led pre-accident . \ni have a problem not with the story or story structure , but with egoyan's heavy- handedness behind the camera . \nfor the first hour or so , i can quite honestly say i was on the verge of tears ; these are miserable , miserable people . \nbut that's just the problem : so anguished are these folk that sympathy wanes after a while , when a lot of sadness becomes too much . \nalso , a subplot involving incest rings untrue . \nperhaps it wouldn't feel so contrived if it weren't shot in such a tasteful manner . \nthere are two characters who are father and daughter ; when they first appeared i thought they were lovers . \ni was half-right . \nnevertheless it's worth-seeing . \nthe delightful critic geoff pevere recently wrote that \" american films are about action , canadian films are about consequences , \" hence a recent wave of films about the effects of shock and death from toronto directors , including crash and kissed . \nthe sweet hereafter is much better than either of these two films , simply because it's not boring or , in the case of kissed , afraid of its own material ( necrophilia ) . \negoyan is a fine , fine , postmodern storyteller , whose work is entertaining , edgy and smart , if a bit too intellectual at times . \nthough i harped on the weightiness of the material , i was always absorbed , engrossed , and surprised by the sweet hereafter . \n", "i know what i would do with $4 . 4 million if i found it in a previously undiscovered airplane crash site , especially if i were with jacob and lou . \n ( huh ? ) \nwell , in any event , that is the situation hank ( paxton ) finds himself in . \nhe and his dim-witted brother jacob ( thorton ) and tubby friend lou ( brent briscoe ) come upon a large bag of cash inside a plane wreck . \nagainst his better judgement , hank decides to go along with the idea of keeping it rather than going to the authorities . \nthe rest of the film is a question of who is going to die to keep this a secret , and is it worth it ? \na simple wish lies along the lines of very bad things , clay pigeons and even fargo , and is kind of wrapped all into one little dark bundle . \noh , and its much better than any of those . \nsam raimi took a departure from his normal freak-show horror-monkey films and made this stylish and intriguing picture . \nhe really lets the audience sit back and watch the events unfold rather than force them down our throats as many directors prefer to do . \ni think raimi knew he had a winner on his hands and decided to direct the picture on a natural flowing course . \none of the film's components can be linked to a recurring theme in terrence malick's the thin red line . \nin malick's three hour bore-a-thon , he makes an interesting attempt to link mother earth to his war story . \nit seemed nothing more than an occasional pretty cut to a field of flowing grass , a small bird , or a flowing body of water . \nsure , there were obvious metaphorical connections , but there was no subtlty to his efforts . \nraimi does a fine job of tying in a fox in a chicken coop and birds of prey to signify the future of the characters . \ni think most viewers may miss the comparison , but it is a very intriguing ingredient in the film . \nand then there's billy bob thorton , who is proof that the independent film industry is vital to the life blood of hollywood . \nif it can continute to produce people like thorton , hollywood will be ok . \nhe gives a fantastic and devastatingly deep performance here . \nit is not as engrossing as his carl childers character in slingblade , but is is just as complex , if not more so . \njacob is slow and simple , and yet we so often see him deep in thought . \ni wondered if he was thinking about things that he would never say ( or didn't know how to say ) or if he was just taking a long time to think about the thing he just said . \nhere he really proves his worth as one of the best character actors in the industry . \nthough the plot is somewhat unoriginal , it has a very appealing new twist in its characters . \npaxton gives one of the better performances of his career as the straight and serious leader of the group ( a far cry from chet in wierd science ) . \nperhaps bridget fonda is miscast as his advice-giving wife , but she certainly doesn't do anything ruin the picture . \na simple plan can be included in the group of recent small hollywood films that is just dark and pretty un-redeeming . \nbut at least this one has an important message , unlike so many of its counterparts . \n", "i saw simon birch in a basically sold out theater , on a sunday afternoon . \nwhen the movie was over and the audience was exiting , i didn't hear one negative comment , and i didn't have any to offer . \nsimon birch is primarily about the friendship of two twelve year old boys , simon ( ian michael smith ) and joe ( joseph mazzello ) , and what destiny holds for both of them . \nsimon is a dwarf , who was not supposed to last through the night after birth due to a weak heart . \nsurprisingly , he does , and now constantly reminds everyone that he is a living miracle . \nsimon thinks god has a plan for him , a purpose for his life , and his condition , he just doesn't know what . \njoe is an illegitimate child ( referred to both comically and dramatically throughout the film as a bastard ) , who's mom ( ashley judd ) won't tell him who his father is . \nsimon has more than just dwarfism as a problem , the people in the town don't really like him , because he isn't \" natural \" . \neven his own parents don't care about him , and are disappointed they didn't have a \" normal \" son . \nhe is also harassed in church by the local pastor , rev . russell ( david strathairn ) and simon's chain smoking sunday school teacher played by jan hooks . \nthe only person , other than joe , that really cares for simon is joe's mom , who he also looks up to as a mother . \nit would be just simon's luck , that he would accidentally kills joe's mom , something you are told at the beginning of the movie . \njoe , now motherless as well as fatherless , feels the need to find out who his real father is . \nwith the help of ben ( oliver platt ) , the local drama teacher and joe's mom's current boyfriend ( before her death ) , he will attempt to locate his dad and get in a little trouble on the way . \nmost of this trouble is laugh out loud funny , although not all of it is . \nsimon will also look for god's plan for him , although he loses a little faith along the way . \nstarring in the first ( and last ) five minutes of the film is hollywood's newest dramatic actor , jim carrey . \njim plays the adult version of joe and does a impressive job starting the film off , and then tying it up just right . \nthis is the first character jim has played that is not over the top in anyway , and he does a commendable job . \nsimon birch is written and directed by mark steven johnson , this is his first film as director , but he has written several films , including the grumpy old men series . \nhe does an outstanding writing and directing job here , the film's structure is flawless and its flows together perfectly . \nthe dialog goes from extremely funny to morose without missing a beat . \nthe cast is excellent . \njoseph mazzello gives the stand out performance . \njoseph is outstanding for someone of any age , not alone someone who just turned 15 . \nian michael smith , in his film debut , has such a strong physical presence that you believe he is simon without any hesitation . \nother great performances are turned in by the rest of the supporting cast . \ni loved this movie , it is far and away one of the best films i have seen all year . \ntake your whole family to see simon birch , it is a magnificent film- an american masterpiece . \n", "the saint was actually a little better than i expected it to be , in some ways . \nin this theatrical remake of the television series the saint , and its series sequel the return of the saint , val kilmer plays simon templar , an elusive thief who makes a living by stealing things from others for others . \nthis movie closely resembles a james bond flick . \nit has the classic bond symbols : a man who can do just about anything and get away with it , a woman whom the man persues , a villain out to achieve something for himself who kills anyone to reach this goal . \nkilmer actually provides a rather good role in this movie , although at times you are left to ponder how he actually gets out of the many tight situations . \nthe movie begins in his childhood in a strict school run by catholic priests . \nas a young boy , kilmer's character enjoyed magic and would often journey away from his schoolwork . \nthat is until his school teacher finds him reading a book and demands that the young boy proclaim his name , that of a catholic saint . \nhe refuses to do so and instead announces who he wishes to be . \nthis leads to a devestating mistake , which is something that will stay in his mind throughout his life . \nkilmer's first mission that we are shown is to steal a microchip from ivan tretiak , played by rade serbedzija . \nduring a press conference , he must make his way into a heavily guarded vault area , avoiding guards , cameras , and many other potential obstacles . \nonce his mission is completed and he is safely home , the fee is paid . \nwhen he logs into his bank account and finds that he is only a few million dollars short of $50 million , he decides to carry out only one more mission , then retire . \ndr . emma russell , portrayed by elisabeth shue , has discovered a way to produce energy by way of cold fusion . \nthis new advancement would change the world and save thousands of lives in the areas of russia , where millions are without heat and are freezing to death . \nthe only problem is , tretiak would like to have this for himself and use it to gain power amongst the people . \nthis presents the option for kilmer to achieve his goal . \ntretiak hires him to steal the equations , small pieces of paper , from shue . \none of the enjoyable features in the film is the disguises that kilmer dawns to complete his missions . \nthey are very convincing , not only to the characters in the movie , but to us . \nkilmer utilizes one such disguise to lure shue's character into getting to know him even more , which would provide him a means of stealing the energy formula . \nwhen the two meet , and end up having a sensual experience , kilmer's character is seemingly falling in love with emma russell , as she is falling in love with kilmer's alter-ego , a traveling artist . \nyet , he must reach his goal of $50 million , which requires him to steal the energy formula , putting his feelings aside . \nshue's character is eventually able to track down simon templar by putting the pieces ( the names of the catholic saints ) together , something no one else is able to do . \nwhen she finds him , they are left to team up and reclaim the energy formulas from tretiak . \nthe saint is very action-packed , with few slow points . \nthe sound was very well done and added to the many intense moments . \nalong the course of the movie , there are even a few , although brief moments of comedy . \nthese moments are almost always thanks to kilmer's extraneous , very convincing disguises and personalities . \nall in all , a rather enjoyable movie with nearly non-stop action . \n", "the thirteenth floor , the third in what i would call \" the reality check movie series \" , is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year , the matrix and existenz . \nall three made you think , made you wonder what is real , what isn't , and if our world is just a huge game . \nthe thirteenth floor doesn't reach the level of originality , creativity , and curiosity sparked by the matrix and existenz , but it certainly gives a great shot at it . \nin the matrix , we were told that the humans are simply a virus . \nin existenz , we learned that our life could be just a game . \nin the thirteenth floor , we learn that we are just electronic devices , living under another world of electronic devices . \nthere is just one world on top of another , and everything in them are fake and electronically generated . \nthe thirteenth floor took a huge , risky turn that i didn't expect it to take , and i'm not very sure it was such a great turn to make . \nrather than focusing just on the reality parts of the film , the thirteenth floor becomes a murder mystery that ends up tying in with the different worlds . \nafter the mysterious murder of computer program designer hammond fuller , played by armin mueller-stahl , douglas hall , played by craig bierko , a man that worked under fuller for many years , must travel through an electronic computer device that fuller was using , to the year 1937 , which consists of computer generated characters only . \nthe simulation of 1937 is just like it was back in the olden days . \nall of the people involved are just characters , or are they ? \ndouglas strongly believes that a character traveled through the transport from their world to ours , and killed fuller . \nalong the way , douglas interacts with many different potential suspects , and a woman who claims to be the daughter of fuller , jane fuller , played wonderfully by a talented young actress , gretchen mol . \nthe thirteenth floor is a plot driven movie from the time the film gets going , and doesn't use spectacular special effects and big sound to keep the viewer's interests . \ni was worried that this film would be too much like the matrix and existenz , and i wouldn't enjoy it , but there were enough twists and turns to keep me thinking and attentive to the film . \nunfortunately , many potential would have been great scenes were thrown away with predictable content , letting the viewer know the outcome of the scene long before it happened . \nthe scenes that aren't original or interesting seem to go absolutely nowhere , leaving you wondering , \" what is the point of this ? \" \nsometimes it was hard to believe that this story , with terrible dialogue , some bad acting , especially from craig bierko , and scenes that go absolutely nowhere , are actually true . \ni know this isn't a true story or anything , but a film should be able to make you think that it is . \non the plus side of acting , we get to see the missing from main character action since the film masterpiece shine in 1995 actor , armin mueller-stahl . \nin the thirteenth floor , he is back and is still giving believable and amazing performances . \nanother plus is gretchen mol's realistic performance , creating her character with depth , not just staying in the one-dimensional phase . \ndon't expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz to come out of the thirteenth floor , just expect another film that messes with your mind for awhile , and shuts you down like any other movie would . \nthrills , chills , and spills aren't what you will get in this film , but you will just get another trip to send your mind on , scrambling it until you've had enough . \nthe bottom line- let's hope this is the last of the \" reality check \" based movies for awhile . \n", "i tried hard not like this movie without succeeding . \nit contains parts of bringing up baby , any hepburn/tracy film , part of the plot of war games , cary grant and rosalind russell in his girl friday , elevator shaft action , train action , and murder . \nit is cute , funny , suspenseful ( a little bit ) , sexy ( a little bit ) . \none of the bad guys was a surprise . \nthe pace is fast enough , there are some \" action \" scenes . \ni think that this is a reasonable family summer movie for families with older kids who have already seen maverick . \njulia roberts and nick nolte are fine separately and together . \ni really identified with the julia roberts character ( wishful thinking , i know ! ) , but i do have better hair ! \nher hair , a very dull dark brown , has no color . \nshe could use some highlights . \nthey both do fine with their roles : he's a bored columnist with the chicago chronicle and she's a hotshot \" cub \" reporter with the chicago globe . \nthey have great fun trying to out scoop each other to solve one case throughout this movie . \ni like the one story focus . \nother actors include charles martin smith as roberts' boss , olympia dukakis as nolte's coworker , nora dunn also with the chronicle , and marsha mason as a congresswoman . \nbasically this movie is reasonably fun . \nthere is a serious mystery to solve , and i enjoyed following a fun couple solving the mystery . \nit is a pleasant change of pace from movies that take themselves seriously . \ni do give successful comedy high marks . \n", "plot : jet li is a chinese cop asked to help some french policemen nab a bad guy . \nbut one thing leads to another , and the next thing you know , li's being chased by the same french cops with whom he was supposed to be working . \na lot of ass-kicking , face-whippings , gun fights and . . . okay , a little more ass-kicking ensues . \ncritique : very cool ! \nnow here's a movie that gives you exactly what you're looking for , if what you're looking for is kickass action , a palpable good cop/bad cop story line , some hardcore stunts and jet li slam-dunking everyone in sight ! \nthe film also moves fast ( a mere 95 minutes ) , develops a certain \" cute \" chemistry between fonda and li , has nice surroundings ( paris , baby ! ) and gives us one of the best bad guys that i've seen all year . \ntcheky karyo is the devil incarnate in this film . \nhe is pure evil . \nthey should have called this movie bad lieutenant 2 as keitel has nothing on this man . \nwhat a great , great monster ! \nmy favorite line of tcheky's was when li was explaining the whole \" kiss of the dragon \" thing to him and he cut him off by saying \" kiss my ass ! \" \npure action movie poetry . \nanyway , other than him , jet li also handled his \" acting \" pretty well in this film , with very little real dialogue to say , but enough to make us believe his character . \nactually , just looking into the man's eyes generally tells you a lot . \nfonda was also pretty good , despite playing one of the most trashy and abused women that i have seen in quite some time , but i still felt kinda bad for her , so i guess she did her job okay . \nbut in the end , nobody goes to see this kind of movie for oscar performances . \nwe go to see jet li movies because we want to see jet li kicking a lot of ass from side to side , and this film delivers gangbusters on that front . \nand yes . . . they have no wire-fu in this movie . . . i \nsay again . . . no \nwire-work , no bullshit stunts with li floating around in mid-air for over a minute . \nit's all straight action , fist to fist , boot to face and all around cool stunts . \nif that's what you're looking for , i don't see how you will be disappointed with this film . \nyes , it's not very original in plot ( just take luc besson's own la femme nikita and mix in plenty of his own the professional et voila ! ) , does have an annoying hip-hoppy soundtrack that just got on my nerves after a while ( i also would have gotten rid of the whole acupuncture thang . . . ) and will have anyone not willing to restrain their disbelief , rolling their eyes all over the place . \nbut was i entertained ? \nthoroughly . \ndoes the film feature more gunplay , martial arts and over-the-top kills that most recent action flicks ? \nyes , again . \ndoes this sound interesting to you ? \nwell , the answer to that question is entirely up to you . \none thing that i would definitely recommend is , as jet li pointed out himself on his website , that you leave the kids at home for this one . \nin fact , you might even wanna leave yourself if you can't handle the more violent of sequences . \nall in all , a rippin' , roarin' fun time ! \nwhere's joblo coming from ? \nblack mask ( 5/10 ) - blade ( 7/10 ) - la femme nikita ( 8/10 ) - lethal weapon 4 ( 7/10 ) - the matrix ( 8/10 ) - the professional ( 9/10 ) - romeo must die ( 3/10 ) - rush hour ( 7/10 ) - shanghai noon ( 6/10 ) \n", "i've never been a member of the robin williams fan club . \na little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way , and i sometimes feel as though i'm watching a 40-year-old class clown . \nin his films , williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchy-feely emotion , leading to wildly uneven performances . \nmrs . \ndoubtfire seemed ready-made for the same problems , but instead it proves to be williams' best comic screen project yet . \nwhile it still contains some characteristic self-indulgence , mrs . \ndoubtfire is nonetheless an engaging belly-laugh comedy served up with high energy . \nwilliams stars as daniel hillard , a cartoon voiceover artist with a penchant for irresponsible behavior . \none such incident proves one too many for wife miranda ( sally field ) , and she files for a divorce . \nunemployed , living in a disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with limited time with his three beloved children , daniel decides to respond to miranda's ad for an afternoon housekeeper . \nhe turns to his brother frank ( harvey fierstein ) , a theatrical makeup artist , and emerges as euphegenia doubtfire , a matronly 65-year-old englishwoman . \ndaniel uses his access to the house to keep an eye on miranda's flirtation with a wealthy client ( pierce brosnan ) , to spend time with the children , and to learn something about responsible parenting , all the while trying to keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best . \nmrs . doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work , and basically it does so . \nthe most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel , and thanks to the fantastic special makeup that's instantly believable . \nit may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film , making dustin hoffman's dorothy michaels look like milton berle . \nmore problematic was a series of calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell ; it's a bit hard to swallow that she doesn't recognize any of the voices as her husband's . \nperhaps the biggest contrivance we're asked to swallow is that daniel could make a quick change into mrs . doubtfire in a few minutes . \nthere's more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask . \nfortunately , these are inconsistencies which only attract attention as the credits roll . \nduring the film , i was generally too busy laughing . \nafter getting off to a slow start involving too much of williams' riffing , mrs . \ndoubtfire kicks into high gear once the wig and pads are in place . \ndaniel's frantic attempt to fool a court officer is wonderful , as is the climactic restaurant sequence , even though i saw the resolutions coming a mile away . \nclearly , most of the credit for doubtfire's success goes to robin williams . \nit took putting him in drag , but for once he plays a comic character that isn't just robin williams with a different name . \nhe thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire , and seems to relish the scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt and foul-mouthed . \nwisely , he never aims for saintly . \nhis responses to the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty , but the kind of thing most of us might do with the benefit of anonymity . \nit's one of mrs . \ndoubtfire's charms that neither daniel nor miranda is perfect , just people trying to be better . \nas miranda , sally field is solid in a background role , and pierce brosnan is nicely understated as stu . \nthe children are also good , although mara wilson is almost oppressively cute as the youngest . \nthe supporting players merely step aside and allow williams to do his thing . \nit's easy to see mrs . \ndoubtfire as little more than tootsie warmed over , and it's true that there are both broad themes and specific details in common . \nbut mrs . \ndoubtfire manages to carve out its own space , particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving a judge's decision and the ultimate status of daniel and miranda's relationship . \nthere's nothing dazzlingly new in mrs . \ndoubtfire , but there are plenty of laughs , and good comedies are always in short supply . \nand it's nice to see robin williams just act for a change . \n", "weir is well-respected in hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subject-matter into deceptively simple , powerful films , the mosquito coast ( utopia ) and fearless ( post-traumatic stress disorder ) among them . \nin the truman show , weir essentially breathes life into the now-tired concept of media-manipulation by tackling the material from the inside-out . \nit certainly helps that he has an underrated performer in top-form playing the title character , truman burbank . \nby now you must be aware of the premise : unbeknownst to him , truman ( carrey ) is the star of his own tv series , a 24-7 peep-show in which he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations ; people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants . \n`seahaven' , his hometown , and the show itself , are the brainchild of christof ( harris ) , who presides over his creation in the base of a fake moon , directing over 500 cameras and hundreds of actors and extras . \nfor 30 years , truman suspects nothing-`we accept the reality we're given , ' poses christof-but a desire to break free of the sunny town and visit a long lost love in `fiji' ( mcelhone , who was actually an actress fired by christof for trying to break the confidentiality agreement ) overwhelms him . \nthus , christof and his team suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer of seahaven intact , lest truman discover the world outside and put an end to the highly-rated program . \nin a few broad strokes , weir creates a convincing second-reality , and he has the good sense not to bring christof into the picture until almost three-quarters through . \nthis allows us to comprehend and accept truman's world before we contextualize it . \nfor all his madness , christof has shown the world a place without violence and hardship , and demonstrated that a human being can function well within it . \ntruman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be , well , so darn nice ; like a sibling ( or , perhaps more appropriately , a caged animal in an interactive zoo ) , they want to see him succeed . \nthe surrealistic soap opera is completely plausible thanks to a tight screenplay and a sympathetic carrey-he really is an everyman here , abandoning his facial contortions in favour of a credible , wide-eyed bewilderment . \ncinematically , the truman show is impeccable , stylishly photographed by peter biziou and littered with symbolic images . \nas well , it employs wojciech kilar's piece \" zycie za zycie' masterfully and beautifully . \nif the film has any flaws , one may find them in laura linney's characterization as meryl , truman's \" wife \" ( i doubt that betty crocker impersonation would fool anyone ) , and in a subplot involving truman's `father' , which feels curiously incomplete . \nthere are a few stupendous sequences , and the film pulls off a wonderful trick : we become truman's audience as much as the loyal viewers in the film . \nthey wear buttons asking `how will it end ? ' \ni couldn't wait to know myself , though i didn't exactly want it to end , for this inspired movie is possibly the best-and most complex-summer picture in years . \n", "synopsis : it's 1977 in a small italian american neighborhood in new york . \ndisco music is popular , and the sexual revolution is on , but the people of new york are not happy . \nin fact , they're terrified . \nas in spike lee's do the right thing a heat wave has the city in its grip , and peoples' tempers are flaring . \nthe cool of night offers no respite : the neighborhood is being terrorized by a nocturnal psychotic killer who calls himself the son of sam . \nno one knows who the son of sam is , and no one is safe . \nall around new york people are different . \naside from cultural groupings and ethnic neighborhoods there are differences between individuals . \nin the italian american section of town a philandering husband named vinny ( john leguizamo ) tries to hide his trysts and sexual behavior from his long suffering newlywed wife dionna ( mira sorvino ) . \nvinny's friend ritchie ( adrien brody ) hates disco , works at a gay strip club and doesn't want any of the neighborhood folks to know . \nritchie's girl ruby ( jennifer esposito ) is trying to escape a reputation as a slut . \neveryone's different , but nobody in the film wants to be framed as \" alien \" to the community . \nunfortunately , the killings help create a climate of suspicion pits neighbor against neighbor . \nopinion : director spike lee's summer of sam is not about a psycho killer . \nnor is it about cops trying to apprehend him . \nit's about differences and how , given the right conditions , even close neighbors can fan the hostile flames of irrational suspicion . \none thing i found interesting in summer of sam was the use of sex . \nin other movies sex is glamorized . \nfor example , james bond gets a sexual reward for winning . \nor boring made-for-video \" suspense \" movies are spiked with gratuitous lingerie scenes just to keep the audience awake . \nand every movie or soap opera character in these flicks seems to have expert sexual prowess . \nnot so with summer of sam . \nin a very gutsy move director spike lee shows sex without fantasy . \nsex is there , but it isn't gratuitous or titillating . \nin fact , some of the main characters are downright lousy in bed . \nsex is in the film because ( sexual ) deviance is part of the film's major theme of \" difference \" breeding hostility . \nin my opinion this kind of movie sex is cutting edge for 1999 , as rare and thought-provoking in american cinema as showing a spanking . \n", "part one of \" the strangest movies ever made \" series at www . mediajunkies . com \nby scott watson \n[light spoilers , nothing you shouldn't read] \nexistenz has been called \" a gooey matrix \" , and while this is a correct description in some ways , in others it is completely off . \nthe only thing the two films have in common is the idea of a virtual reality that is indistinguishable from normal , \" real \" reality . \na major difference is that \" the matrix \" has a base reality that is obviously the true reality , while existenz does the impossible and makes us accept the most bizarre reality ever as true . \nand oh what a reality it is . \ndavid cronenberg has shown us before that he knows how to create strange movies ( naked lunch , crash ) , but this one is one of the strangest . \nmaybe it's because of how the mundane is mixed with the bizarre . \ntechnology is organic , but only some of it . \ncars are normal . \ngas stations are the same . \ncell phones are glowing bug like appendages . \nyou jack into a virtual reality game using a quivering pink gooey animal like apparatus ( referred to simply as a \" pod \" ) . \nhigh technology has been replaced with organic creatures , and it provides a truly surreal setting for the characters . \na famous game designer , allegra geller ( a fine looking jennifer jason leigh ) , flees a demonstration of her latest game , existenz , after an assassination attempt . \nshe is on the run ( from who , i'm still not sure ) , and has to save her pod by playing her game with \" someone friendly \" . \nthat someone friendly is her dubious companion and security guard , ted pikul ( jude law ) . \nunfortunately he is lacking a fundamental requirement for playing , a bioport . \nsort of a hole in your spine ( ok , exactly like a hole in your spine ) , a bioport allows you to plug the vaguely entrail-looking wires from the pod into you , allowing you to play the game . \nluckily a bioport can be installed easily ( they install them in malls ) , so off they go to get one . \nafter a crazy series of events at the local country gas station , they are able to plug in and play existenz . \nthe plot itself is a surreal melding of conspiracies , reality distortion , chinese restaurants , and multi appendaged amphibian things ( \" it's a sign of the times \" ) . \nbut the plot , while cohesive in it's own creepy way is secondary to just trying to figure out what the hell is going on in this universe . \ncronenberg just slaps this weird organic-tech world into the viewers lap , and it's up to you to figure out how all these things work . \nand that's the true joy of this film , entering the vaguely nightmarish world in which existenz takes place . \nyou learn a little bit piece by piece ( oh , they make pods out of those ) , and it's just enough to get you to accept the world that is presented to you . \nthere are all kinds of twists and turns as the characters wander around , including a fantastic scene in a chinese restaurant that will leave you trying to assemble something out of your moo goo gai pan for months afterwards . \nalso the bioports are occasionally used for things other than porting into existenz , the specifics of which i will leave for you to discover . \nthere's lots of little things that set off the weird-o-meter , like the little tiny pods that you can buy in the video game store , the two headed amphibian creature , and why that guy at the gas station's name appears to be \" gas \" . \nit all adds up to a supremely far out trip , and given the choice i think i would rather live in the matrix's virtual world . . . \noh wait , i already do . \n", "good films are hard to

and subtle acting , an intelligent script , and masterful directing , together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these days , genuine motivation in a story that rings true . \nconsider the strange coincidence of russell crowe's character in proof of life making the moves on a distraught wife played by meg ryan's character in the film -- all while the real russell crowe was hitching up with married woman meg ryan in the outside world . \ni haven't seen this much chemistry between actors since mcqueen and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah's masterpiece , the getaway . \nbut enough with the gossip , let's get to the review . \nthe film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman ( david morse ) , an american engineer working in south america who is kidnapped during a mass ambush of civilians by anti-government soldiers . \nupon discovering his identity , the rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for $6 million . \nthe only problem is that the company peter bowman works for is being auctioned off , and no one will step forward with the money . \nwith no choice available to her , bowman's wife alice ( ryan ) hires terry thorne ( crowe ) , a highly skilled negotiator and rescue operative , to arrange the return of her husband . \nbut when things go wrong -- as they always do in these situations -- terry and his team ( which includes the most surprising casting choice of the year : david caruso ) take matters into their own hands . \nthe film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and creates a complex and intelligent character-driven vehicle filled with well-written dialogue , shades of motivation , and convincing acting by all the actors . \nthe script is based on both a book ( the long march to freedom ) and a magazine article pertaining to kidnap/ransom situations , and the story has been sharply pieced together by tony gilroy , screenwriter of the devil's advocate and dolores claiborne . \nthe biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe and ryan , but that between crowe and david caruso . \ndug out from b-movie hell , caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as crowe's right hand gun while providing most of the film's humor . \nryan cries a lot and smokes too many cigarettes , david morse ends up getting everyone at the guerilla camp to hate him , and crowe provides another memorable acting turn as the stoic , gunslinger character of terry thorne . \nthe most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes . \nthe bulk of those scenes , which bookend the movie , work extremely well as establishment and closure devices for all of the story's characters . \nthe scenes are skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and poise . \ndirector taylor hackford mixes both his old-school style of filmmaking with the dizziness of a lars von trier film . \nproof of life is a thinking man's action movie . \nit is a film about the choices men and women make in the face of love and war , and the sacrifices one makes for those choices -- the sacrifices that help you sleep at night . \n", "i must admit i'm going to be a bit biased in my review of the new romantic comedy serendipity , because that also defines how i met my current girlfriend . \nthe magic and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very romantic serendipity . \ni am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre , but something drew me to this film . \nmaybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role , and the hilarious eugene levy . \nmaybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemption he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity , con air , and pushing tin . \nbut maybe it was because i feel as giddy as a school kid right now with this whole romantic thing currently in my life . \nthe story of serendipity is simple . \ntwo people , john trager ( john cusack ) and sara thomas ( kate beckinsale , looking ever so hot ) , have a chance encounter over a pair of gloves -- with buck henry smack dab in the middle . \ncharmed beyond repair , these two knuckleheads grab a sundae together at a caf ? called serendipity , talk about that irresponsible thing called fate and the avenues it leads people down , and spend a few hours at the local ice skating rink . \nbut with each of them already involved with other parties , sara has john write his name and number on a $5 bill and she writes her name and number on a copy of love in the time of cholera . \nsara declares that if this \" thing \" -- let's just call it love -- is destined to happen , fate will bring them together in the future . \nyears later and on opposite coasts of america , john and sara -- both engaged but still unsure whether they have found their soul mates -- decide to seek each other out to rest their doubts . \nwhat happens then is an enjoyable and often hilarious cat-and-mouse game with the fates - involving such items as mistaken identity , a graduate homage , john corbett as a freaky new age musician , and eugene levy as an irate and crazed salesman -- to find out if that \" thing \" was right after all . \nfortunately , first-time screenwriter marc klein has sketched strong , well-rounded , characters to propel a predictable and corny narrative . \ncoupled with deft directing by michael chelsom ( director of the very unfunny town and country and the very funny funny bones ) and the use of time-lapse camera work to illustrate the passage of years -- the film comes off with genuine believability and sincerity . \nboth piven and molly shannon make nice sidekick characters \non the flipside , films such as you've got mail , made in heaven , and even high fidelity are the quiet inspirations for the film's main journey at hand . \nbut it's what happens to the unexpecting characters left behind in the romantic wake after john and sara find happiness this is the most unsettling part of the picture . \n", "in some regards , making a movie is like trying to stretch a rubber band as far as you can without breaking it . \ntry too hard , and it snaps ; but too much reservation means someone else will come along and pull it farther . \nin simon birch , director mark steven johnson shows us just how to master the technique : he takes advantage of caution and poise , but also risks his movie with a few bold steps . \nin the end , he's not only holding an unbroken band , but he makes the audience appreciate the lengths he went to direct such a fine feature . \nthere's no doubt about it : the film that johnson has crafted is rich . \nhe chooses for his setting the quaint town of gravestown , maine - leaves turn bright orange in the fall , the grass is a lush green , pure white snow falls in the winter , and the sky goes on forever . \nthe characters continue that turn : our two leads are simon birch ( ian michael smith ) and joe wenteworth ( joseph mazzello ) . \nsimon is the smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital , and by age twelve he's only two feet tall . \njoe is the bastard son of rebecca ( ashley judd ) , and by age twelve he's ready to know who is father is . \nnaturally , the two outcasts become good friends and share many adventures together , from disrupting sunday school to doing community service to playing little league baseball . \nin a wonderfully executed performance by ian michael smith , simon birch is convinced that he's god's instrument , and there must be a reason he's so small . \njoe doesn't quite buy it , but he sticks by simon ; the two tough it out through the worst of times and are each other's only true friends . \nearly on , the two meet up with ben goodrich ( oliver platt ) , rebecca's new boyfriend , and although the bond isn't immediate , ben and the two boys develop a liking for each other . \nboth platt and judd give solid performances that lend their characters a deep likeability . \nthe audience cares about them as much as they do about joe and simon , a testament to the acting jobs of both . \nfinally , jim carrey gives a cameo as the adult joe in the present day , and his few minutes here are relatively more impressive than his entire performance in the truman show . \nmark steven johnson's sense of drama and writing is fantastic . \nthe script is loosely based on john irving's novel , a prayer for owen meany , but it's so far off the source material that irving actually requested the credits be changed from 'based on' to 'suggested by . ' \nalong those same lines , it's almost unfitting to compare the two ; johnson uses tension , humor , atmosphere , and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions . \nby no means has he developed a project of similar popularity - gump made over 300 million dollars while birch ought to pass out of sight in a few weeks - but the winning idea remains the same . \nsimon birch is a different look at a different life , and one that will most likely be studied in film school classes in decades to come . \nin the present , however , it's an enjoyable little picture that everyone ought to take a look at . \n", "on the basis of this film alone , i never would have predicted that , in two years , quentin tarantino would become the country's biggest hotshot director . \nreservoir dogs has hints of the tarantino brilliance that emerged in pulp fiction , but is a much less substantive , more conventional crime story than the big pf . \nhere's what the two movies do have in common . . . \n--scenes of intelligent , amusing dialogue with no relevance to the plot --a story that jumps back and forth in time rather than going in a logical , chronological sequence --graphic yet necessary violence --an engaging crime story --dialogue liberally spiced with swear words and racial/gender slurs --three of the same actors ( harvey keitel , tim roth and steve buscemi ) --a mexican standoff ending , although this one is considerably less optimistic than pf \nreservoir dogs is an entire hour shorter than pulp fiction because it's only got one story to tell rather than three . \ncrime lord joe cabot ( veteran actor lawrence tierney ) has assembled five criminals who have never even met each other to pull a diamond store heist . \nthe five are instructed not to reveal their real names or personal details or anything the cops could use if one of them was captured and interrogated . \ninstead , they are all given code names off the color chart -- mr . white ( keitel ) , mr . pink ( buscemi ) , mr . orange ( roth ) , mr . blonde ( michael madsen ) , mr . brown ( tarantino ) and mr . peach ( tarantino's chin ) . \nmost of the movie's running time is spent with mr . white and pink waiting at a warehouse for the others to arrive . \nmr . orange , meanwhile , is on the floor , dying from a gunshot wound . \nthe police had arrived at the scene of the crime way too soon , leading white to believe one of the five was an informant . \nthe story's background unfolds through a series of flashbacks , of the crime itself and the meetings between joe and the criminals prior to the crime . \neventually , blonde arrives with a police officer hostage , and what follows is a truly brutal , uncomfortable torture scene . \nlet's just say picasso would be inspired by what blonde does to the cop's ear . \na lot of the time , reservoir dogs seems like your typical gangster heist-gone-wrong movie , but there are a few sequences that are uniquely tarantino . \nthe opening scene in the coffee shop starts the movie off on a high note the rest of it doesn't live up to , as the criminals plus joe have a conversation on , among other things , tipping philosophies and their interpretations of madonna's \" like a virgin . \" \nanother scene involves roth's lengthy manufactured story about running into a group of cops and a police dog in a bus station bathroom while carrying a giant bag of marijuana . \nneither of these have much plot relevance but are given ample time to develop , like the captain koons gold watch speech in pulp fiction , only here these sequences are more enjoyable than the rest of the movie . \nreservoir dogs is good but it's no pulp fiction . \n", "it's a fact that a good thriller or action movie doesn't need violence to be good or worth watching . \nall it takes is potential violence to make the audience bite their nails . \nand what kind of violence could be more efficient than a global thermo-nuclear war ? \nand potential violence is the premiss wargames is built upon . \na computer whiz-kid , david , is usually contended with hacking into the school computer to change his grades . \nbut after having read an advertisment for an upcoming computer game , he wants to be the first to play it . \ninstead of getting into the computer at protovision software he accidentally comes to the frontgate of norad . \nwith the help of jennifer , a girl in his biology class , he starts to play a nice game of nuclear war with wopr , war operation plan response ( a top-notch computer at the time , but now hardly faster than my own computer ) \ni remember being 12 and watching this at the cinema . \nit was very efficent at giving you a scare in those days and that hasn't changed . \nof course , a nuclear war seemed to be much more of something that could actually happen back in 1983 . \ni wouldn't be surprised if this gave people nightmares . \ni hope it still does since you still hear about school kids hacking into the computers at pentagon . \nbroderick and sheedy are just fine as the young teenagers ( although her interest in david remains a mystery ) . \nbut the rest of the actors are , by no fault of their own , restricted by the script to play one-dimensional grownups . \ndavid's parents are the same kind of parents that populate all these college comedies from the 1980s , movies like secret admirer , porky's or zapped and the norad general beringer is straight out of dr . strangelove . \nif for no other reason , you should see this movie to enjoy how far the computer technology has gone since those days . \ndavid uses the same telephone for calling friends as calling other computers . \nthe modem is some kind of device that he puts the headset on . \nfar from any 56k modem my guess is that it's some kind of 2400 bps modem , the kind of technology you now find at your local technical museum . \nthe big computer at norad has a lot of flashing lights ( just like those you see on star trek or any old sf-movie ) but it's hardly impressing compared with what you can get today . \nwhat are the lessons we can learn from wargames ? \n1 . \nmake sure there are no secret backdoors into military computers . \n2 . thank you , whoever it was , for giving us a graphical user interface when we use our computers ! \n", "there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie and a successful suspense movie . \naction movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences , while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything full-circle . \nfor fans of both genres , however , realism is key . \naction fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic , and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movie's end . \non this advice , director john frankenheimer ( the island of dr . \nmoreau ) strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller , ronin . \nthe depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing , considering the fare that's fallen into the same category over the last few years . \nthe script , written by j . d . zeik in his big-screen debut , approaches levels of complexity that had people spinning away from mission : impossible two years ago . \na certain number of people will be lost by this , but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times . \nfrankenheimer masters the script with poise , and tells us a dark but stoically realistic tale of a group of post-cold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck . \nhis ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here , and ronin becomes a better movie because of it . \nrobert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time . \nhe takes command and offers much gravity as the ex-spy sam , a man who's called to france to help a shady operations controller named dierdre ( natascha mcelhone ) recover a package . \nthe package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast , especially once the requisite double-crossing begins , and its role is skillfully penned by zeik . \nat times , however , zeik's tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission : impossible - de niro might easily become tom cruise , the package might become cruise's computer disk . \nfortunately , the focus here is almost entirely on the package , whereas in mission the script was more concerned with the double-cross and why it happened . \nthe action content is impressive , and it lives up to the hints given in previews . \nthe only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect full-blown combat scenes and instead are forced to suffer through moments of slowness . \nronin does take a degree of intelligence to follow all of the nuance from start to finish , but even the uninitiated will be able to keep a grasp on most characters mand subplots . \nthe suspense tapers off considerably by the end , a bit of a drawback because of its height at the movie's open . \nconsidering these factors it's good to see that ronin was a project that turned out well , and it's another good bet this month . \nsince quality is usually sparse during the early fall months , it's definitely worth the visit . \n", "jay and silent bob strike back , kevin smith's swan song to his two most famous characters ,

just laugh ; they went wild with boisterous laughter and heavy applause throughout . \nin short , if you like really raunchy humor , you may find it , as i did , to be the funniest movie of the year . \n ( on the other hand , if you are one of those who walked out in disgust with smith's dogma , then jay and silent bob strike back is not the movie for you . ) \nin one of the fastest paced movies of the year , the story has jay and silent bob ( jason mewes and kevin smith ) , a pair of card carrying drug dealers , traveling from their new jersey convenience store home to hollywood so that they can stop a movie . \nit seems their comic book alter egos , bluntman and chronic , are being used in a movie without jay and silent bob's consent . \njason biggs and james van der beek are slated to star in it . \njay and silent bob strike back has more and better used cameos than just about any movie that i've ever seen . \namong others , they include carrie fisher as a bible-toting nun , mark hamill as a comic book version of his famous alter ego and gus van sant as a director too busy counting his money to yell , \" action ! \" \nbest of all are ben affleck and matt damon who mock themselves and their movies . \nthe film stops several times to make fun of itself and of the audience who was \" stupid \" enough to buy tickets to this movie . \n ( actually , purchasing tickets to this film is extremely smart given that it delivers more laughter per dollar than anything in recent memory . ) \nthe film even skewers people who write about movies on the internet . \nguilty . \nalthough it's filled with inside jokes , you'll still be laughing even if you only get some of them . \nit's easy to understand enough so that they are still funny . \njay is a motor mouth who hasn't met a subject that he couldn't vulgarize . \nhis favorite topic is oral sex , but , being an equal opportunity profaner , he's willing to make crude jokes about absolutely anything . \nbut it is his buddy , the aptly named silent bob , who is responsible for most of the movie's success . \nhis reaction shots , with his wildly exaggerated eye movements , are comedic gems . \nthe story's main subplot concerns four animal rights activists , justice ( shannon elizabeth ) and her three sexy buddies , sissy ( eliza dushku ) , missy ( jennifer schwalbach smith ) and chrissy ( ali larter ) . \nthese charlie's angels types give a ride to our heroes on their trek to lalaland to stop the picture . \njay tries to put the moves on justice , but he doesn't stay in command of the situation for long . \none of the funnier sight gags has the women using a pink , clam-shaped , birth control case that contains high tech gadgetry . \ngranted , it's not the movie for everyone , but , if you like kevin smith's brand of humor , you'll find that this is his best . \nand , as i said earlier , it's the funniest movie of the year thus far . \nno , wait . \nforget , `thus far . ' \nit's bound to be the funniest movie of the year . \nin a time when almost every movie feels obligated to come in at pg-13 so that they can rake in the maximum cash , it's great to see a filmmaker with the guts to target only a mature audience . \njay and silent bob strike back runs a lightening fast 1 : 35 . \nit is rated r and contains pervasive crude humor and language and sexual situations . \nit would be acceptable for high school seniors and older . \nthe film opens nationwide in the united states on wednesday , august 22 , 2001 . \nin the silicon valley , it will be showing at the amc and the century theaters . \n", "damn those trailers . \nhad it not been for the advertising of this film , which reveals far too much about its contents , i would have been glued to `under the sand' . \nas it is , the film retains some value , thanks to an excellent performance by charlotte rampling , and a more mature francois ozon in the director's chair . \nmarie ( charlotte rampling ) and her husband jean ( bruno cremer ) lounge on the beach . \nshe takes a nap while he goes for a swim . \nwhen marie wakes up , jean is nowhere to be found . \nshe contacts authorities , but they can't find him either . \ndid he disappear to start a new life ? \nwas he killed by accident ? \ndid he commit suicide ? \nmarie still asks herself these questions a year later , and in order to move on with her life , she must find some answers . \nit's a fine premise , and this little movie uses it to the limit . \nthe film moves at a leisurely pace , a bit slow , but relaxing . \nit's a very visual story , and you can pretty much just sit back without reading the subtitles . \nthis is mostly thanks to the excellent camera work by antoine heberle and jeanne lapoirie , who shot the film in a dreamy haze , and the lead performance by rampling . \nrampling is so expressive in her portrayal of marie , you connect with her character instantly , despite that she's delusional . \nthe scenes where she interacts with her husband , who she still believes is alive , are heartbreaking . \nshe can't quite get over him . \nthey've been married for twenty-five years . \nthe other actors , particularly jacques nolot , are excellent too . \nthe sex in the film is rather unneeded , but compared to ozon's `criminal lovers' , it's the disney channel . \nlikely to cause some discussion afterwards , `under the sand' is a fine movie going experience . \nwhile it's hard to recommend as entertainment , it's a fine adult alternative about how we deal with loss . \nozon seems to ask what you would do , and that's certainly a hard question to answer . \n", "bob the happy bastard's quickie review : \nrush hour \nso what's the problem with 48 hours clones these days ? \nthey always try

heralded film , titanic . \npostponed from last summer , with an escalated budget that makes it the most expensive movie in history , this was one film i was eager to preview . \nso , is this movie going to sink or swim this holiday ? \nmy best guess . . . . it will sink , though with many awards attatched to its hull . \nno doubt , titanic is the most elaborate disaster movie ever made . \nit boasts the most amazing effects that i have ever seen done to date . \nto see a ship fall apart , with actual people running across the ship , flying across the deck , and falling to the water , is just amazing to look at . \nthe effects are so stunningly realistic , you would swear you were looking at actual footage . \nbut titanic is more than a disaster movie , and that's where the problem lies . \nthere is a love story attatched that nearly ruins the entire premise . \ni'll give a capsule summary of the story without spoiling anything for you : \nthe film begins with a modern day excavation of sorts of the sunken titanic . \nwe see actual footage of the sunken ship , as cammeron had set up special cameras to film the wreckage on the ocean floor . \nbill paxton leads the expedition , in search of sunken treasure . \nwhat he finds instead , leads him to a mysterious old woman who recounts her tale of the titanic voyage . \nwe meet rose ( kate winslet ) , a young woman , who comes from an upper-class family . \nrose is to be wed to a man she does not love . \nwe meet jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a young man , who comes from a poor financial background , and wins a ticket aboard the titanic , in a poker game . \nthe two meet under interesting circumstances , and the love story begins . \nadd in a jealous fiance , and a not-so-nice law officer played by david warner , and you have a story that , well , gets a bit overplayed and oversappy . \ni must add , at this point , that the most likeable character in the movie is played by kathy bates , as a woman with \" new money \" who is a lot less uptight than the other rich folk on the ship . \nshe is a pleasure to see on screen . \nwhen the ship does hit the iceberg at exactly 1 : 40 into the film , and eventually sinks , you never really feel for any of these characters . \nthe film is just loaded with unlikeable rich snobs and other folk you never really get a grasp on . \nthe effects are tremendous . \nfrom the roars of gears and pumps in the engine room , to a doomed ship cracking at the seams , this is an effects picture that looks and sounds like no other . \nwe saw titanic in dolby digital surround , and by far , it is the best sounding movie i have ever seen . \nmy friend commented it was the best sound mix he has ever heard . \nwhen people are in the water , at film's end , you are surrounded by the voices of lost soles . \ntitanic runs far too long . \nthe movie is 3 hours and 15 minutes in length . \nand , while most of the first 2 . 5 hours runs very fast and well-paced , the final 45 minutes almost comes to a sudden stop , and you realize that this sappy love story has to finish itself out before the movie finally ends . \ndon't get me wrong about titanic . . . . it's \nnot a bad as i am making it out to be . \nit really is an exceptionaly well-made film . \nthe costumes and sets are incredible , and true to the time period . \nthe ship is painstakingly created exactly true to form , as we see actual pictures of the modern-day wreckage , transformed into the movie depiction . \nthis film will certainly win on effects , costume , set design and sound . \ncameron has certainly made his best film to date . \nunfortunately , titanic is not a best picture candidate . \nit just doesn't have a strong supporting story . \nit's an exceptional disaster film with sappy filler inside . \nit just doesn't have the emotional impact that i suspect mr . cameron was shooting for . \ni predict that titanic will open to likeable reviews . \nit is a film worth seeing . \ni predict that it will only do moderately well at the box office . \nwith its extreme running time , and lack of enough robust to get substantial word-of-mouth , i expect that it will do even better on home video . \nthis will certainly be the definitive ac3 movie for all you home theater enthusiasts . \ntitanic opens december 19th , and is released by paramount pictures and twentieth century-fox . \ni give titanic 3 stars ( . \nthat's not bad . \nron epstein \nriginally posted in home theater forum === \n", "a common complaint amongst film critics is \" why aren't there more literate scripts available ? \" \nquiz show gives signs of hope that the art of writing isn't dead in hollywood and that we need not only look to independent films for thoughtful content . \npaul attanasio's script takes what could have been a tepid thriller ( the quiz show scandals of the late 50s ) and delivers a telling parable about the emptiness of the post war american dream and the golden bubble that surrounds and protects tv networks and their sponsors . \nthe film is riddled with telling symbols ( e . g . \na '58 chrysler , a radio announcement of sputnik ) but is never heavy handed . \ndeft direction by robert redford and keen performances by ralph fiennes , john turturro and rob morrow dovetail perfectly with the carefully honed script . \nredford departs from the usually overlight , \" cable tv quality \" sets and camera work so common in recent 20th century period pieces . \nquiz show perfectly captures the colors and textures of the eisenhower years . \nalthough i was only 4 years old when the \" twenty one \" scandal broke , enough of the 50s icons survived throughout my childhood for me to recognize the authenticity of redford's almost tangible palette . \nfrom plastic covered furniture to carefully coifed contestants , the images ring true from that era of rampant consumerism , of a generation that had gone through 15 years of depression and world war without \" disposable income , \" before the manifestation of its american dream . \nthe film deftly weaves several themes together , from assimilation and exclusion of jews from \" the good life , \" to the lengths that a scion of a literary family will go to to match his father's fame . \nthough the 50s audience that is \" rocked \" by this scandal may initially seem naive to us , they should appear all too familiar , with our current national passion for the rise and fall of icons like michael jackson or tonya harding . \ncharles van doren and herbie stemple were the overnight mega celebrities of their day . \nthe tv audience is almost a fourth main character , always at the center of the decisions being made on their behalf . \nat the film's end , the credits roll past slow motion footage of that same 50s tv audience , mindlessly laughing at some piece of fluff . \nlike the distorted mirror that captured a blurred swastika at the end of cabaret , this \" mirror \" may reflect an image we're not all that comfortable with . \n", "whew . this film oozes energy , the kind of breakneck , no- holds-barred , in-your-face risk-taking filmmaking that is seldom seen on screen these days . \nlike the marginal , motley bunch of post-apocalyptic youths director danny boyle tries to depict , trainspotting veers on the edge of utter mayhem but ultimately retains its footing and control . \nthe result : a movie that is a delightful example of how the medium is the message . \nthe message : a bunch of losers with loser names , mark renton ( ewan mcgregor ) , spud ( ewan bremner ) , sick boy ( jonny lee miller ) , tommy ( kevin mckidd ) , and begbie ( robert carlyle ) . \nbored , aimless and restless , their routine consists of getting drunk at the local pub , grooving to techno or glam-rock at the local disco and getting shots up the arm at the local den and procuring cash through a variety of methods , some ingenious , others plainly dumb and desperate .

smeared across the wide-angle lens . \nthis film camera is just another one of the guys . \ntiptoeing that indistinguishable line between fantasy and reality , boyle employs a healthy dose of surrealism to get the message across . \nbored kids daydream and bored kids deprived of a heroin fix have nightmares . \ni don't want to give too much away , but if you cross chuckie from child's play with some of the wacky fantasies in heavenly creatures , you might have an idea just how fun or pants-wetting scary the alternate state of consciouness can be . \nthat said , this film has a good share of drugs - consumed , vomitted , defecated , pissed off , exchanged , bought , sold , injected , smuggled , enjoyed and regretted . \nif that isn't your cup of tea , nobody forced you to see the film . \nstay at home and rent up close and personal . \nand what's a buzz without tunes . \nfrom pulp to iggy pop ( yes , he's still alive ) , the aural landscape is as engaging as the visual energy permeating the film . \ngood and bad vibrations tangle like the conflicting desires and values of the message . \nevery once in a while , a film comes along with the kind of energetic filmmaking that matches the intensity of its characters it hopes to depict . \ntrainspotting is that shooting star that burns across a sky littered with static constellations . \ndom is a part-time filmmaker who graduated from northwestern university's radio/tv/film programme not too long ago . \nhe has laboured on various music videos and short films in and around campus and chicago . \nnowhere town , a 26min short film that he shot , co-directed and co-produced recently scooped up the grand jury prize at the charleston international film festival for best student production . \nhe is currently finishing a couple of small projects . \nwith his minute amounts of leisure time , dom does nell impersonations . \n", "steven spielberg's \" amistad , \" which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship , then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who \" owned \" them , is concerned with several different aspects of this story . \nfirst , the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery . \nsecond , it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case , including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) . \nlast , and most importantly , it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade . \n \" amistad \" succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements . \ni have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another \" anti-slavery \" movie . \nhaving seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery , i doubted that there was much i didn't already know about it . \nfortunately , i turned out to be wrong . \nfor one thing , spielberg's camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders' operations in africa , so \" amistad \" was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning . \nand some of the images here are , in fact , much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery . \none scene in the middle , in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their \" excess \" slaves by throwing them overboard to drown , has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year . \nspielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would , and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc-17 rating . \nthe stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians , such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain , whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only a small child at the time . \nexposing politicians as narrow-minded , opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff , of course , but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation . \nthe film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time , such that john quincy adams ( and probably other politicians like him ) , who clearly disapproved of the practice , was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court . \nthe biggest success of \" amistad \" is probably the characterization of cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , the lawyer who represents them in court . \nthrough cinque , we are given a window into the native culture , as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member , or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ . \ncinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that , again , contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles . \n \" what kind of country is this , where laws 'almost' work ? \" he asks baldwin in bewilderment , when he learns that the case must be re-tried before the supreme court . \nspielberg's direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times , such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinque's angry outburst in the court room . \nstill , there isn't enough of this for it to be a serious problem . \nthe main flaw in this film , which prevents it from earning four stars , is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni can't quite handle all of these issues at the same time , so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie . \nthis summer's contact , for example , dealt with several issues at once , but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and , most importantly , all of them were resolved at once . \n \" amistad \" tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams , but it somehow feels a little forced , and in any case the speech itself , which lasts almost fifteen minutes , wears out its welcome about halfway through . \nperhaps the best way to describe it is this : \" amistad \" is three four star films edited into one . \nalmost every individual scene works , but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence , and thus is less than the sum of its parts . \nhowever , i can't honestly say how it could have been done differently , and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film , and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery . \n", "he has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment , raised and cared for and imprisoned by his domineering mother . \nshe inspires his love and his fear , and instills in him a similar love and fear of jesus . \nhe has a rudimentary grasp of language , mouthing monosyllables and repetitions of his mother's phrases . \nhe is taught that the world outside is fatally poisonous ; his mother dons a gasmask whenever she goes out the door . \nhe is 35-years-old in body , but a child in mind and spirit . \nhe is the premise for bad boy bubby , a defiantly original australian movie about a man called bubby ( nicholas hope ) who has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment , etc . , etc . then one day his father ( ralph cotterill ) appears . \nhis father is a shabby down-at-heels priest who appears to have permanently misplaced his religion . \nunsurprisingly , he is not thrilled with the way \" his \" boy has turned out . \nhe is , however , rather pleased at renewing his acquaintance with the mother ( claire benito ) , and , more to the point , her ample breasts . \nsoon they are copulating on the dingy couch , while bubby crouches , confused , in the next room , acutely aware that the mother who had devoted all her attention to him has a new interest . \nbubby's relationship to the world may be warped , but it is at least stable . \nthe father's arrival disturbs his precarious balance , causing an oedipal conflict which ends--freud would be pleased--in violence and , as a result , freedom . \nbubby intuits from his father's arrival that the air outside is breathable : he leaves the apartment , his past , his world , behind . \nso far , so good . \nthe first thirty minutes or so of bad boy bubby , which bring us to this point , are quite brilliant . \nthe movie is at its best when its stays within the constraints of bubby's hermetic two-room universe . \nit follows through unrelentingly on the implications of its premise : bubby is used by his mother for sex , he unwittingly suffocates the pet cat with cellophane , he is terrifed by the notion that jesus will beat him senseless if he sins . \nit is grim and savage and appalling , but also strangely tender--de heer , having imagined a life as bizarre as bubby's , does not exaggerate for comic or grotesqe purposes , but simply empathizes . \nhe observes what it might be like . \nthe intensity of these opening scenes , with their minimalist mise-en-scene , immerses us in a claustrophobic environment which seems to be a decayed stratum of our own world , and owes much to david lynch's eraserhead , not least the ambient industrial white noise of the soundtrack . \nfor thirty minutes , the movie maintains the feel and mood of a reality that does not seem far removed from our own . \nthen de heer lets bubby out , brings him into contact with our world , and the film never quite recovers . \nour unlikely hero finds himself in port adelaide , where he wanders the streets and meets people , where he suffers and learns and survives . \nhe is seduced by a young woman from a salvation army band ( how an anti-social half-wit with no sense of hygiene manages to get laid mere hours after his escape is not the sort of question the film encourages , wisely ) ; he is given free pizza by a sympathetic waitress ; he insults a traffic cop and is punched in the stomach ; he shares a few beers in the back of a truck with a rock group ; he is imprisoned and raped ; he becomes a translator for mentally handicapped people whose speech is impaired beyond comprehension ; he is loved by a motherly large-breasted nurse ( carmel johnson ) . \n . \n . \nit goes on , by turns inventive , silly , tasteless , endearing , and sometimes all of these things at once . \nde heer never seems to be sure how bubby should interface with the real world : the tone shifts , uneasily , from fable to realism to satire and back again . \nthe scenes which try to touch base with a believable version of reality are the weakest ; the film is best understood as a kind of parable , and , indeed , the religious implications of bubby's experiences are foregrounded : icons of jesus on the cross hang from the mother's walls , bubby dons a priest's collar stolen from his father , a church organ-playing atheist lectures him on the necessity of unbelief , the woman who redeems him is named angel . \nthe manifold stresses of our world do not shatter bubby's mind , do not fragment him into psychosis ; rather , the world accomodates him , and heals him . \nalthough de heer's touch is at times overbearing , bubby's salvation is touching ; what seemd at first a harsh lesson in the damaging effects of the social construction of reality becomes a na ? ve humanist tale of improbable hope . \na hapless rock group write a song about bubby and sing it for him and so give him the gift of community . \nhe returns the favour when he steps on stage one night and becomes their frontman , turning the fragmented impressions of his experiences into performance art , and turning the band into a popular draw . \ninnocence triumphs . \nbubby becomes a holy fool , an idiot savant , and graces us with wisdom . \nit's a strange turn of events , but by now we shouldn't be surprised , because bad boy bubby ain't like other movies . \n", "being that it is a foreign language film with no known names with a select number theaters showing it , \" shall we dance \" won't be seen by that many people . \nand that's a shame - this is a funny , enchanting , and goofy movie full of laughs , surprises , and wonderful dance sequences . \nthe surprising thing about \" shall we dance \" is the universal appeal of the story . \na us version is in the works , and it's no wonder - it's not really all that culture specific . \nalthough there is a narrated set-up that adds some extra resonance to the proceedings ( about the view the japanese culture has about ballroom dancing ) , the movie is so rich in character and appeal that this added layer isn't at all necessary to understand or enjoy the film . \nthe only important unexplained japanese-specific reference that may leave some a bit puzzled is that 1000 yen is roughly $10 ( when you see the film - and you should see this film - you'll know why ) . \na middle aged company man realizes that achieving all the goals he set for himself in life ( a house , a child , and good marriage ) still doesn't translate into a fulfilled life . \nafter glimpsing a melancholy beauty looking out from a dance studio window while on the train home from work , sugiyana ( koji yakusho ) decides after some trepidation to take up ballroom dance lessons in order to meet the woman who has stirred something in himself . \nafter finding the weekly fees for private lessons from the elegant and beautiful mai ( tamiyo kusakari ) too rich for his blood , sugiyama opts for groups lessons simply to be near her . \nwe then meet the players in this gem of a movie , who all have their own reasons for joining the class . \nlater on , we meet aoki at the dance studio ( naoto takenaka ) , a co-worker and all out weirdo and one of the laugh riot highlights of the film . \nthe story , laughs , and touching scenes evolve as the movie goes along . \nit's a pleasure to watch such a wonderful film that is propelled almost solely by the characters and performances . \nit's difficult to explain the charms of the film without revealing too much - the movie abounds with little revelations that subtly shape the characters , and in the end , each one is that much fuller and more understood by the time you leave the theater . \nit's one of those movies that only the french seem to make anymore - no big plot , no special effects , no gunplay , no tragic consequences , no forced examinations of the nature of love , and no insights into the nature of evil . \njust a warm , funny , endearing film that will charm the pants off of you . \nwhen was the last time you left a theater feeling all warm and fuzzy inside ? \n \" shall we dance \" will do that to you without any treacly aftertaste . \n", "when i first heard of contact , the hype was building it up as a sci-fi blockbuster . \nnow , with that in mind , coupled with the knowledge of jodie foster's involvement in the project , i thought \" what in the world is foster doing in a sci-fi blockbuster ? ? ? \" . \nas it turned out , my expectations were completely nullified and turned topsy-turvy . \nrobert zemeckis , back from the euphoria created by his last film , forrest gump , once again proves his mastery in fusing tales of adventure with along the endearing lines of human spirit . \ndon't get me wrong , contact is sci-fi ? but with a definite difference . \nbased on the late carl sagan novel of the same name , the story delves itself in questions on science and god ; fact and faith . \nallie ( foster ) is a radio astronomer . \nshe spends her time listening to the stars , via ultra-huge communication dishes in search of intelligent life beyond the solar system . \nher passion for `long-distance communication' is the result of her younger days being spent avidly in front of a ham-radio system ( a hobbyist radio communication device ) which her late-father bought for her . \na scene which particularly strengthens the audiences' view of the passion is when she asked her father whether she could contact her late-mother through the ham-radio system in which her father replied \" not even the most powerful radio in the world can do that , now \" . \nallie's research is based on the seti project ( search for extra terrestrial intelligence ) , in which she listens to radio emissions from other galaxies in the hope of finding one which would suggest intelligent manipulation . \nher work has never been off the scrutiny of the us government , which considers it a waste of taxpayer's money and politically unviable , her supervisor ( tom skerritt ) pulls the plug on seti . \nundaunted , allie managed to gather a loyal group of `believers' and eventually found funding from a large private corporation . \nthe following months were treacherous to their hopes and research as they are contantly pressured by the government but all that changed when one day , she caught an emission of a seemingly intelligent repeating sound-wave . \nthe news of her find attracted hordes of alien believers , cultist , the media and of course , the government . \nthe situation became intense upon her discovery of pictorial plans on building a form of transport which were embedded within the repeating sound emission . \nas the world join forces to build this transport , allie is desperate to be the one to go . \nshe enrols herself among a few hopefuls , to represent the world when the transport is ready for operation . \nher eligibility for the spot failed when she is questioned on her beliefs in the existence of god by the president's spiritual advisor ( mcconaughey ) ; allie , being an atheist , a result of her belief in fact and science , refuses to budge upon questioning . \nat this point the movie plot thickens considerably as she is romantically involved with the president's spiritual advisor . \na strong point which propelled the movie is the depth of its main characters played by foster and mcconaughey . \nfrom the very first meeting scene , it is obvious that the two of them was sort of kindred spirits but they were worlds apart in almost all aspects , foster being a person drawn to science and facts and mcconaughey being one who believes in faith , hope and the power of the unseen . \nthe meeting of their worlds , added with the situation which they are put into makes the entire storytelling process near flawless . \nmany people who read the synopsis of this film would find it a tad too ridiculous , but by actually immersing yourself in it , gives you an entirely different perspective ; one which is free from bias and pre-conceptions . \nzemeckis and his team of screen writers have done a remarkable job in telling this tale through film . \ncontact works by not delving in controversy but rather , touches the thinking audience , urging them to ponder upon the questions raised in the film concerning fact and faith ; whether one can actually find compromise within . \ni consider contact as one of the must-sees for this year . \n", "you've got to love disney . \nno matter what they serve up , it is a guaranteed success as long as it's animated . \nkids have to go see the movie . \nthen they have to get the toys . \noh , the video came out ? \ngot to buy it , or risk little billy's temper tantrums for the next month . \nall of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage to mecca : a visit to the magic kingdom . \nstay at the disneyland hotel ! \nbuy a disney t-shirt ! \neat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick ! \nit's both a vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it . \ndale carnegie should have had it so good . \nwhat's most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality . \nyou see , disney animated features these days have two components : theme and plot . \nthe theme changes with each new movie ; the plot does not . \nthe plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped , and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features , they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same . \nhowever , while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as box-office receipts , merchandising dollars , and glimmers in the eyes of little children , critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer . \nluckily , disney's latest animated offering , mulan , manages to be engaging and refreshing , even while rife with formula . \nthe film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns , led by the imposing shan-yu ( miguel ferrer ) . \nsoon , china's emperor ( pat morita ) mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in china's defense . \nwhen the fa family is served notice , it is the elderly father , fa zhou ( soon-tek oh ) who must answer the call , as there are no other males in the household . \nfearing her father will surely be killed in battle , fa mulan ( ming-na wen ) disguises herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army . \nmulan , based on a chinese epic poem , is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling . \nmulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family , as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman's role , and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband , we see that \" grace \" is not one of her strong points . \nvery early on , we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to one's family , and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker , mulan fails at that task . \nby leaving home to fight in her father's place , she may not only spare his life , but bring honor , too . \nas is the case with most disney musicals , the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film . \ni'm not sure if they will get much airplay , but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time . \nboth lea salonga , who provides the singing voice for mulan , and donny osmond who sings for shang , the captain of mulan's army unit and obligatory love interest , are more than competent , although salonga's voice translates much better to animation . \nyou have to hear it to understand . \ninterestingly , the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan . \nthere is no significantly big number , which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film , but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie . \nit is , however , an expectation which has been built by disney's own formulaic history , and some viewers may feel as if something is missing . \nartistically , the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork , and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works , it helps to contribute a more authentic , and therefore more credible , nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically \" disneyfied \" ethnic tale . \nthere are also a couple of visually standout scenes , one involving the charge of shan-yu's hun army , which utilizes the same computer-enhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast . \nthe other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it . \nwhen mulan resolves to take her father's place , she dons her father's old battle armor , and unsheathes a sword . \nas she does so , you can see her reflection in the polished metal . \nit just left me thinking , \" that was really cool . \" \na wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film , varying from the straight , such as soon-tek oh as fa zhou , to the comical , such as harvey fierstein as yao , a gruff , pugilistic member of shang's conscripted army . \neven more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu , the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan . \nalthough an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin , murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance . \ni found the choice of b . d . \nwong as shang a little strange ( you may remember him as martin short's wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride ) , but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty and the beast , so i guess anything's possible . \nin any event , wong performs admirably as well . \none character which provides a significant amount of humor is grandmother fa . \nshe deserves recognition not only because of the levity she brings to the movie , but also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people . \njune foray , who supplies grandmother fa's speaking voice , is a venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel and natasha fatale ( as in boris and natasha ) . \nmarni nixon , who provides grandmother fa's singing voice , is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices for anna in the king and i , maria in west side story , and eliza in my fair lady . \nwith this in mind , hearing grandmother fa is like listening to a little piece of history . \nmulan is the latest disney animated feature to get away from some of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films . \nin an effort to be culturally sensitive ( and to avoid a \" miss saigon \" -type debacle ) , disney has also wisely chosen to employ many asian-american actors for both lead and supporting roles . \nin addition to the actors already mentioned , the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong , gedde watanabe , james shigeta , and george takei . \ni guess clyde kusatsu wasn't available . \nat a running time of slightly under an hour and a half , mulan moves quickly and provides solid entertainment for both children and , happily , adults . \nthis is the kind of disney feature that makes you wonder what they will do next , rather than hope that the next one is better . \n", "with three pre- to mid-teen children and an aging father-in-law to care for--cooking and cleaning and laundry , drop-offs at little league practice and pick-ups from ballet practice--margaret hall's life is rife with complications . \nand with her naval officer husband stationed somewhere in the north atlantic , virtually impossible to reach by telephone , margaret leads the crazed life of a single parent . \nbut margaret's hectic world is about to get a lot more complicated . \nher teenage son beau , a talented trumpet player with strong prospects of being accepted into wesleyan university's music program , has fallen in with the wrong crowd . \nhis mother drives from their idyllic , lakeside community of tahoe city , california to the sprawling urban metropolis of reno , nevada , with its imposing concrete superstructures and seedy neon-lit nightclubs , to confront the 30-something man who has befriended beau . \n \" stay away from my son \" margaret warns darby reese . \nher words , however , appear to fall on deaf ears as reese turns up drunk at the family homestead later that evening , urging beau to join him in the boathouse . \nthere are words and advances and some pushing and shoving and beau runs back into the house , passed his startled mother , as the crack of a wooden railing giving way breaks the cold blue silence and an intoxicated reese tumbles out of sight . \nthe next day , on her morning walk , margaret discovers reese's lifeless body lying crumpled on the shoreline , a boat anchor impaled in his chest . \nwith her maternal instincts working overtime , margaret quickly ferries the body out into the lake , weighs it down , and dumps it overboard . \nbut margaret's life is about to get a lot more complicated . \nsoon after the body is discovered , snagged on a local fisherman's line , margaret is paid a visit by an attractive-seeming blackmailer in a red nova . \nalek spera threatens to hand over compromising videotape of beau to the police unless margaret comes up with $50 , 000 by 4 o'clock the next day . \nbut margaret's life is about to get a lot more complicated , for alek turns out to be something she never expected . \nbased on elisabeth sanxay holding's novel \" the blank wall , \" \" the deep end \" is a well-crafted thriller written and directed by scott mcgehee and david siegel ( \" suture \" ) . \nit makes the most of a talented but not particularly well-known cast--goran visnjic plays alek with a suave likeability , jonathan tucker shines as the conflicted beau , peter donat is amusing as grandfather hall , and josh lucas has an equally small but effective role as the hapless darby reese . \nthe film is also lovingly photographed by giles nuttgens and features an evocative score , courtesy peter nashel . \nbut it owes everything to british actress tilda swinton . \nswinton , whose pale-faced ethereal beauty has graced many of derek jarman's films ( \" caravaggio , \" \" edward ii , \" \" the last of england \" ) , plays margaret hall in \" the deep end \" and , like charlotte rampling in this year's \" under the sand , \" turns in a commanding and accomplished performance . \nmargaret is a devoted mother who is willing to risk everything to protect the ones she loves , and swinton captures every frustration , every fear , every subtle examination and every fervent realization and every nervous oscillation of her being . \nthe role calls for an extremely wide range of emotions none the least of which is simply playing a mother beset with a multitude of domestic responsibilities . \nmany can relate to that , of course ; it's the murder cover-up and the blackmail and the fear of losing one's son that swinton so gracefully , so graciously , makes resonate with the truest of colors . \nthe end is deep all right , and there isn't a single shallow moment in tilda swinton's canon . \n", "i hate to burst your bubble , but after all the star power , mega bucks , screenwriters , directors , and cool trailers , men in black is not the best movie of the summer . \nit's pretty good in it's own right , yes , but i would probably split the \" best movie \" honors among face/off , spawn , con air , and maybe event horizon . \nit's main problem is that it's quickly forgettable , and i can't remember one truly good scene from it . \nfrom con air , it was the scene out in the desert when they were digging the plane out from the dirt . \nin spawn , it was the \" living room hell \" conclusion at the end . \nin event horizon , it was the video of the event horizon crew being taken over by hell's forces . \nand all of face/off was pretty dang good . \nbut as for men in black , the only scene i still recall is when will smith is squishing all those giant roaches . \ni remember it not for it's humor but because i am hate roaches with a passion and was pretty disgusted . \nand yes , i did see mimic , which is something i'll touch on in a later review . \nback to men in black ( is it just me , or does that sound funny ? ) \ni remember first hearing about men in black back when i was a comic geek in the 7th grade and read magazines like wizard , etc . ( for those of you who aren't comic-geeks , wizard is basically to comics what car and driver is to cars , what the new yorker is to high society , what boy's life is to boy scots . \nokay , that one was pretty pathetic . ) \nfew people know this , but men in black is based on a very obscure comic book that was , while not honest-politician-rare , very hard to find . \nthis was after the release of the high-grossing batman forever , and it said that tommy lee jones and chris o'donnell were being considered for the roles ( in the comic book , there were no black men in black . \nkind of weird , huh ? ) \nall i can say is , thank god they didn't cast chris o'donnell . \ni know i can't be the only person on the planet who thinks he's an annoying , preppie little snot . . . \nsorry . \nmy apologies to o'donnell fans . \ni actually had a 7th grade teacher who was a big comic collector and was set to buy some of the comics from him , anticipating rather craftily that , if the movie was a big hit , it would drive up the price of the comics rather nicely . \nhe decided not to sell them to me , because they were \" innappropriate \" . \nhmm . . . . \nso now you're probably wondering why i've wasted about 5 paragraphs with lame anecdotes from my junior high years . \ngood question . \ni'll move on to the movie now . \nas you probably already know , will smith and tommy lee jones ( agents k and j , respectively ) belong to a top secret agency known as divison 5 , or it's nickname mib ( men in black . ) \nmen in black is a reference to the black suits and sunglasses the agents wear , and they're mission is to investigate reports of alien landings and keep the aliens under control while they're here on earth . \nnot to get too technical or spoil the plot for the 6 people in the world who haven't seen this movie , but a basically-big-roach-type-bug lands in a redneck farmer's yard , inhabits his body , and attempts to destroy the entire universe . \nnot bad , eh ? ( i have no idea why i just typed that . \ni'm not even really paying attention anymore . ) \nthe special effects are good yet dissapointing in men in black . \ni found their main headquarters to be boring , as were the \" cool weapons \" they had . \nthe noisy cricket just plain sucked , no matter what anyone said . \nand the movie definitely surprised me in tone , although it probably shoudln't have . \nit's director , barry sonnenfield , is known for \" black humor \" , directing both addams family movies . \nthis movie was basically a \" black comedy \" , not an action/sci-fi like i expected from the trailers . \ndon't get me wrong on what i think of this movie . \nit's not bad , i gave it * * * . \nit was mostly entertaining throughout it's run , and had a very good ending , although i think i was the only person in the theater not amazed by it . \nmy diagnosis for this picture : a good weekend rental , but not worth a movie ticket . \nof course , the movie is now long gone from theaters , but that's beside the point . \ni think . \n", "susan granger's review of \" osmosis jones \" ( warner bros . ) \nif the farrelly brothers taught anatomy & physiology in school ,

animation then takes over when his body's immune system contacts traffic control as an ingested virus hits the digestive system : \" be on the alert for illegal organisms ! \" \neager to right \" a stomach evacuation mistake \" he once made , a cocky , clever , courageous white blood cell ( chris rock ) declares , \" this is a crime scene ! \" \nand teams up with a conscientious \" phi beta capsule \" 12-hour cold remedy called drixenol ( david hyde pierce ) to chase down and destroy the deadly \" red death \" virus ( laurence fishburne ) that's determined to take frank down in 48 hours , beating ebola and e . coli to a medical record . \nwatch out for mucus mudslides , chaos in cerebellum hall and the detritus from booger dam ( runny nose ) , along with comic turns from molly shannon and chris elliot , plus the voices of william shatner and brandy norwood . \npeter and bobby farrelly , along with writer mark hyman and animation directors piet kroon and tom sito , have turned their penchant for gross-out comedy , encompassing flatulence , festering sores and \" popping a pimple without a permit , \" into a funny , farrelly-funny family film . \non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" osmosis jones \" is a wildly imaginative , original , explosive 7 . \nand perhaps , as they're laughing , kids will learn where to find their uvula , along with nuggets about nutrition and hygiene . \n", "i must say from the outset that i have never been much of a kurt russell fan . \ni've seen some of his films ( silkwood , backdraft , unlawful entry ) and while he gave adequate performances , i have never been impressed with his work . \nbreakdown , then , is something of a surprise . \nrussell gives a fine performance , as do most of the cast , one that is not upstaged by the action orchestrated in the second half of the film . \nto say that he holds the film together would not be completely true , but he does it no harm . \nrussell plays jeff , one half of a married couple travelling with his wife amy ( kathleen quinlan ) cross country to san diego to start a new job and a new life . \nwhile journeying through the desert their car breaks down and , left helpless and stranded , jeff waves down a passing truck driver ( j . t . \nwalsh ) who offers to take them to a nearby diner to call for a tow truck . \nbecause of a nasty incident earlier with a couple of ruffians , jeff decides to stay with the car while amy gets help . \nthat , it seems , is the last time jeff ( or anyone else ) sees her . \nbreakdown has been compared to several movies : george sluizer's the vanishing ( the original , hopefully , not his appalling hollywood remake ) , steven spielberg's duel and any number of hitchcock films . \nas with these , breakdown does not , for the most part , stray down the conventional path of the american action-thriller . \njeff does not become a gun-toting vigilante on the hunt for his wife , but instead becomes a scared , confused everyman who has no idea what the hell is going on . \nwhen we do find out what has happened to amy , it does come as a slight disappointment , if only because it's too early in the film ; i for one could have done with an extra twenty minutes or so of mystery and bewilderment , but this affects the film little . \nrussell , as mentioned earlier , is very good in his role , and kathleen quinlan is nowhere near as annoying as she was in apollo 13 . \nj . t . \nwalsh , as the possibly evil truck driver , is terrific ; he is one of the best of the fine batch of character actors hollywood doesn't seem to know what to do with , but director jonathan mostow is on the right track here . \nthe reason he makes such a great villain is that he actually looks like a real person , one anyone would be able to trust , which makes the plot that much more believable . \nbreakdown is what hollywood doesn't make enough of , a great thriller with believable characters and scenes that do , indeed , have viewers on the edge of their seats . \none of the most genuinely exciting films i've seen in a long time . \n", "with the success of the surprise hit alien , directed by ridley scott , a sequel was inevitable . \nin fact , after watching the first film , a sequel was wanted , particularly by this reviewer . \nhanding over the director's chair to recent box office gem james cameron , who had only made two films previous to this one ( pirahna ii , a surprisingly dull film , and terminator , making cameron a household name ) , the alien series got a face-lift of immense proportions . \ninstead of being a suspense/science fiction film , cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture . \nwhat results is one of the most terrifying films ever created . \na film like aliens comes along only once in a while , and when it does , audiences are usually unprepared for it . \ni never saw this movie in theaters , but i wish i could have . \nthe terror and fright must have been unimaginable , most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear . \naliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen . \nwith a science fiction plot , cameron gives aliens added testosterone , pumping up the action and fire power from the original film . \nin fact , aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original . \nperhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the hero--or heroine , as the case may be . \nnever have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film , and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character . \nsigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about . \nplacing a woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual , but because of weaver's presence , a woman is the only suitable hero . \naliens begins 57 years after alien ended . \nlieutenant ellen ripley ( weaver ) is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened . \nshe explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens , but \" the company \" is doubtful . \nthey explain that a colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left . \ndespite stern warnings from ripley , the company remains rigid and won't call the families back . \nhowever , when the company loses contact with the colony , ripley's story seems much more feasible . \none of the company's directors , carter burke ( paul reiser ) , wants to gather a team to travel to the planet . \nthis team includes a buff private vasquez ( jenette goldstein ) , a questionable corporal hicks ( michael biehn ) , and a loyal android bishop ( lance henriksen ) . \nburke tags along with ripley as they fly to the planet in order to locate the members of the colony . \narriving on the planet , the team finds most of the human life extinguished in a cocoon-type environment . \nthe only survivor is 12 year old rebecca \" newt \" jorden ( carrie henn ) . \nripley finds this a chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become , and she becomes newt's surrogate mother . \nripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened , and soon , all hell breaks loose . \naliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scott's version , it also multiplies the number of aliens in general . \nalien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member , except ripley , who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo . \naliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens , and as a result , the chills are incredibly heightened . \nthen again , this is james cameron , the guy who has given us true lies and terminator 2 : judgment day . \nhe is the best action director out there ( topping renny harlin , who directed cliffhanger ) , and only he could create something as terrifying as this film . \nit seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes , and aliens has the motherload . \nwith perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film , aliens climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion . \ni can't recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout , never dropping for a moment . \njust when you think the movie is over , something else will occur , and it starts right back up again . \nwith a seemingly endless conclusion , aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history . \nthis scene is usually the one remembered most from the film , as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines to fight the alien queen . \nusing flawless special effects , the climax is exhausting , leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety . \nof course , for a film of this genre to work properly , the technical aspects must be realistic enough for us to believe what we see . \naliens is completely realistic , even a decade after its initial release . \nthe special effects are wonderfully seamless , with a terrifying alien to go with them . \none of the most overlooked aspects of this film is the music , composed by cameron-regular james horner . \nhorner has created a terrific score , receiving an oscar nomination for his work . \nnot only that , horner has also created one of the best scores for any action film , or science fiction film ever ( and that includes 2001 : a space odyssey , which was mainly a compilation of well-known composers ) . \nin fact , the climax music is also some of the most recognized of film music . \nthe production design is incredible , which also happened to snag a nomination from the academy . \ndark corridors lit by red lights are very impressive , but more impressive is the amount of terror which arises from well-lit locations . \nnormally a film will be very dark in order to scare a viewer ; aliens uses lights to scare the viewer . \nthen , of course , is the cinematography , which uses point of view shots , along with video feeds in order to build suspense . \nsome of the scariest scenes involve the perspective of ripley . \nsurprisingly , the acting is not only above average for this genre , but some of the best . \nsigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley , incorporating the right amount of sympathy into her hard-edged persona . \nweaver soars above the rest in this film , but she is supposed to . \ncarrie henn gives an above average performance for a child , developing a three-dimensional character from her quiet attitude . \nlance henriksen is terrific as bishop , showing that androids don't always have to be flat characters . \njenette goldstein shows a fair amount of enthusiasm with her role , and steals several scenes of her own ( though her personality becomes slightly annoying when she isn't fighting ) . \nmichael biehn gives a very nice performance in the most obligatory role of the film . \nhowever , biehn does a good job , making it seem original again . \npaul reiser may seem like an odd choice to play the sleazy corporate director , but reiser manages to pull it off quite well ( however , i still see him as paul on tv's \" mad about you \" ) . \na very good cast ( which also includes bill paxton and william hope ) highlights this action film , making it stand out from others . \naliens is rightfully rated r for violence , gore , language , and terror . \naliens is sort of the redefining moment of the science fiction genre , as alien was more of a suspense/horror film . \naliens pumps up the stakes , and cameron directs it with professional quality . \ncameron certainly knows how to make a good action film , but here he proves how he can create some truly horrific moments on screen . \ntechnically astonishing , aliens' only flaw is small characters who are only there to get killed . \naside from this , you probably won't experience anything like aliens for quite a while . \n", "ingredients : neophyte lawyer , legal situations , corrupt insurance company , \nsynopsis : rudy baylor ( matt damon ) is an ethical kid fresh out of law school who must juggle three legal situations at the same time . \nrudy's girlfriend is attacked by her violent husband ; rudy's elderly landlady wants to arrange her will so that her children are excluded , and ; the family of rudy's friend with leukemia is suing the corrupt insurance company that wouldn't pay for a bone marrow transplant . \nrudy is new to being a lawyer and is thoroughly outgunned , but luckily he is aided by a sleazy ambulance chaser ( danny devito ) who has failed the bar exam six times as well as by the kindly presiding judge ( danny glover ) . \njon voight plays leo f . drummond , the intimidating and arrogant leader of the all-powerful insurance company's team of lawyers who will do anything to oppose justice . \nwill rudy defeat leo ? \nwill he enjoy being a lawyer ? \nopinion : the good news is that this movie has a happy ending , and it features a guy trying to do the right thing . \ndirector francis ford coppola does this film a little differently than the stereotypical law movie . \nin the typical lawyer movie there's one big case and the movie focuses on solving it , and somewhere along the line surprise witnesses and motives turn up before the good guy wins ( after lots of gripping courtroom drama ) . \nhowever , coppola's movie is deliberately more low key . \n'the rainmaker' plays out like a personality sketch of young rudy as he gets emotionally involved with and tries to save various little quirky side characters . \nin the background rudy's voice narrates his feelings and makes half-cynical jokes about the legal profession in general . \ntwo factors combine to make this movie less heavy than it can be . \nfirst , rudy's time is split juggling three cases , rather than concentrating on a single high-stakes case . \nalso , rudy's use of voice narration in place of acting makes the film lose some of its dramatic edge . \nthe end result is an entertaining low key law movie where the good guys win , and rudy narrates his way into coming of age . \n", "in one of my many videos i have attained from the local library , casablanca was my third classic in some weeks . \nthe others being citizen kane and vertigo ( yes , i am trying to see as many of afi's greatest movies ever made as i can ) . \nbut , casablanca stood out from the rest for me : it was actually watchable . \nwhat most hail as the greatest american film ever , casablanca isn't so much a love story as a political frenzy with a love triangle thrown in . \nit seems that star humphry bogart spend about 85 percent of the movie with various leaders of the nation instead of with ingred bergman . \nthat annoyed me , as did the ending . \nwhy didn't the plan turn around ? ! ? \nsurprisingly , i enjoyed the film . \ni liked bogart's character and his acting ( not over the top as most actors in his era ) . \ni once read about if you had a choice to be in a movie , which one would it be , and a women said casablanca . \nat first i was thinking to myself \" why ? \" \nthen , as i watched the film again , i understood why . \nthe movie is very well done and the script top-notch , although i doubt i understood more than half of the political mumbo jumbo . \ncasablanca is , in my mind , no classic ( like solaris ) , but it is a good film and stylishly shot . \nhey , hollywood , how about this : a remake with harrison ford and anne heche ? \nnow that would be a classic . \n", "capsule : suprisingly more of a comedy than a straight action flick , which isn't necessarily a bad thing . \nnot exactly oscar caliber , but one helluva bullet-riddled good time . \nextended review : you know , i remember when hitmen were evil , murderous scum . \nalas , the times are a-changin' . \nin a recent string of movies , hitmen are suddenly wise- cracking , fun-loving killers-with-hearts . \nthis brings us to hong kong director kirk wong's first american feature , the big hit . \noddly enough , about the same time last year a similar film , grosse point blank , was released . \nadvertised as a quirky comedy with hints of action , it turned out to have a suprising dosage of it . \nthe big hit is quite the opposite . \nit was hyped as \" the new film from producer john woo \" , so one would it expect lots of stylized killing and action . \nhowever , there's a sore lack of it , which is about the only thing wrong with the big hit . \nthe film starts out with mel smiley and his cohorts doing a job on a white slaver . \nmel , played by mark wahlberg in a dopey , milquetoast role , is a killing machine ; he flips , spins , even breakdances whilst popping caps . \nsadly , he doesn't get a chance to do much of it . \nexcept for the beginning set piece and the last 20 twenty minutes or so , the film is in comedy mode . \nthe action , at least what there is of it , is prime cut stuff . \nwong , after numerous hong kong features , makes quite a nice u . s . debut . \nhowever , his pacing is a bit off , with the action sequences only bookending the movie and not lasting long enough . \nthey start off electrifying and fresh , but just kinda stop . \nnormally , this would hamper a movie to the point of being unenjoyable . \nluckily , we have ben ramsey's screenplay , a bitingly funny piece of work . \nthe only problem is there might be too much humor , one joke makes you laugh so hard you miss the next few . \nsome of best gags include an oriental film maker down on his luck and one of mel's hitmen pals that has just discovered onanism . \nthe only problem is how some of the minor characters are handled , some being there only for a laugh , which sometimes works , sometimes doesn't . \noverall , the big hit may have it's flaws , but it makes up for them in a stylishly directed , gut-wrenchingly funny joyride . \ndefinately one of the better ways to spend two hours . \n", " \" when will the devil take me ? \" he asks rhetorically in lulling voice over . \nthe spoiled title character of _onegin_ ( pronounced oh-negg-in ) is waiting on death to relieve him after a lifetime of rapacious behaviour . \nmartha fiennes' debut feature is ( quite literally ) filmed poetry ( it's based on an epic russian poem by alexander pushkin ) , a profound study of regret , of how we confuse shame with guilt . \nwhen we first meet eugene onegin ( ralph , acting for his sister ; another brother , magnus , composed the score ) , a philandering aristocrat from st . petersburg , he has just inherited his uncle's estate . \nwith plans to sell it , onegin pays a summer visit to the manor , which is located in an underpopulated russian countryside , and not long into the trip he meets a neighbouring family of blue bloods . \nsmitten with olga larina ( headey ) , he befriends olga's fianc ? , vladimir lensky ( stephens ) , while olga's sister , tatyana ( tyler ) , romanticizing his flippant attitude ( he's a nineteenth bad boy ) , falls for onegin . \nin one sweaty , inky torrent of passion , tatyana writes him a love letter . \nhe is at least intrigued by the note but rejects her affections , it is implied , because he can . \nsoon after , tragedy strikes , and onegin makes himself scarce . \nwhen we catch up with him , six years later , he has just returned to st . petersburg , where at a grand ball he discovers that an old friend ( donovan ) has married a more womanly and wordly tatyana . \nthis time , onegin finds her irresistable . \nwhat is most amazing about ralph fiennes' performance is his subtle physical transformation from dashing snob to miserly grouch . \noverwhelmed by a top hat , the onegin who pines for tatyana seems smaller in stature than the one who brushed her off , an ebeneezer scrooge trapped in christmas past . \nthe actor has been constricted playing heroes for too long now-there's room to breathe in a role that's made up of shades of gray like \" onegin \" . \npetula clark sang of a universal phenomenon in \" parking lot \" : \" you don't know what you've got ? til it's gone . \" \nonegin's about-face on tatyana speaks for those of us ( read : most of us ) who need confirmation that someone or something is wanted by others before we want it as well . \nwhat the character feels is not jealousy but remorse , embarrassment , even , at having let her go . \nout of identification we feel empathy for onegin , a callous bastard . \ntatyana's emotions echo a thousand ditties , but that makes them no less vital . \nshe changes , too , from a girl in crush to a woman with divided loyalties . \ntyler acquits herself surprisingly well among her uk co-stars , filling in sketchy gaps by expressing base sentiments in a series of wanton stares . \nthey both have faces , mr . fiennes and ms . tyler , capable of conveying archetypal russian misery . \n_onegin_ could have added up to little more than a distinguished episode of \" masterpiece theater \" , even with its current cast of thoroughbreds intact , were martha fiennes not at the helm . \nan mtv background ( she cut her teeth directing rock videos for xtc and others ) has positively influenced her sense of pace ( though , thankfully , not her shot lengths-no spasmodic cutting here ) ; at just over 100 minutes , _onegin_ clicks along like a brisk walk through valleys of despair . \nthe film has an atypical period look , as well . \nabsent are the sumptuous tableware and antique furnishings that stand in for plot and character in those drippy merchant ivory productions . \nthe sets are almost expressionistically bare , echoing the loneliness of the protagonists . \n ( cinematographer remi adafarasin often allows space to engulf them ; i'm reminded the climax , which unfolds in a sea of white . ) \nmartha fiennes has a clear command of cinema , and her spare , often painfully human visual presentation of \" yevgeny onegin \" is arguably the most lucid translation of pushkin's difficult text yet . \nms . fiennes may be the most exciting female presence behind a camera since jane campion . \n", "bruce barth's mellow piano plays in the background as conflict erupts in a little country town of florida . \nulee's gold feels like another fonda creation- on golden pond : it has a soft , calm surface with a tempest brewing underneath , the cinematography creates a place of gold , yellow , and olive colors , the music is stirring and tranquil . \nboth deal with the hardships of family life . \npeter fonda gives his undoubtedly best performance in victor nu ? ez's new film and patricia richardson ( home improvement star ) shows she is worthy of big screen attention . \nnu ? ez is probably independent film's greatest asset , along with john sayles , and he proves his talent with a slow pace and undulating , heavy tension . \npeter fonda's performance borrows from his father henry fonda's in on golden pond- there is a great vulnerability that he gives the character ulee jackson and just like his father , peter fonda is quiet , emotional , and weary in this exceptional role . \nulee jackson , the film's protagonist , is struggling . \npressure is mounting at the wrong time . \nhe is a beekeeper and this is his \" busy \" season . \nhe has to deal with his two granddaughters' needs and erupting hormones , he is forced to pick up his daughter-in-law in orlando who is strung out on drugs and take care of her , and he is faced with a challenging task : unsettled business his son , who is now in prison , has left behind . \nhe finds his daughter-in-law , helen , with the two men his son robbed a bank with . \nshe has apparently told these two men that the money that resulted from the robbery is with her husband . \nthat is why he got caught- the police found him with the money . \nnow the two men are demanding they get the cash , or they will come after ulee's two granddaughters . \nulee promises he will bring it to them and takes a deranged helen back to his serene little home where her two children that she abandoned scrutinize her with contempt . \nulee is a man who lost his pals in war- he was the only man in his platoon to survive . \nhe refuses help from anybody and does not respond to affectionate gestures . \nhe is a bitter , closed-off man whose only passion is his beekeeping , his granddaughters , and his dead wife . \nconnie , his next door neighbor , finally gets through to him with friendly favors . \nshe is a nurse and helps helen get through her turmoil with drugs . \nulee's gold is the story of a man who believes he is fine as he is- until the truth is revealed painfully to him : he is cold and unfeeling . \nof course , in the end , ulee softens up , but his journey is absorbing and we have fallen in love with his tiredness and weariness . \nwhat is admirable about the movie is peter fonda's winning turn as ulee and the story that feels like nobody's fool but , in the end , ends up in a class of its own . \n", "susan granger's review of \" big eden \" ( jour de fete ) \nit's utopia , this tiny town tucked away in the timberland of northwestern montana , where old codgers lounge on the porch of the general store to pass the time away and the local matchmakers ( nan martin , louise fletcher ) eagerly pair off the young people , regardless of sexual preference . \nthere's nary a homophobe or bigot around , much to the surprise of henry hart ( arye gross ) , a successful but lonely manhattan artist who returns home to care for sam ( george coe ) , the ailing grandfather who raised him . \nand with the simultaneous re-appearance of his best-friend from high-school and object of his unrequited love ( tim dekay ) , now divorced with two young sons , the fact of his homosexuality must be faced . \nto complete the triangle , there's the tall , taciturn native american ( eric schweig ) who owns the general store and lovingly yet secretly prepares gourmet meals for henry and sam . \nthis fable about home and family is a major debut for first-time film-maker thomas bezucha ( a former designer for coach and polo/ralph lauren ) who is meticulous about minding details , using ballads like \" welcome to my world \" and \" achin' , breakin' heart \" to set up the concept of our universal longing to find a place in which we can love and be loved . \nin the paradise of big eden , what you are doesn't matter as much as generosity of spirit , respect and kindness . \nsure , the plot's implausible but it's a good-natured fantasy so allowances should be made . \nand rob sweeney's photography of glacier national park is spectacular ! \non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" big eden \" is a charming , quirky , off-beat 7 . \nit's a heart-warming romantic comedy about a gay man who doesn't die of aids or wind up alone at the end . \n", "when you go to the movies as much as i do , you unfortunately end up seeing certain movie trailers one too many times . \nsuch was the case with frequency . \nevery time i went to a screening , there was the frequency preview . \nit looked awful . \nit looked cheesy , sappy and ridiculous . \nit looked like a flop . \nwell , whoever put that trailer together should be fired , because in terms of pure entertainment , frequency is one of the best of the year thus far . \nfrequency boasts a compelling story line . \nan occurrence of freakish solar activity allows police detective john sullivan ( james caviezel ) to speak to his fireman father frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) through a ham radio , despite the fact that frank has been dead for 30 years . \njohn is able to give his father information that prevents his death in a warehouse fire , but by doing so causes other changes . \nsomehow , a serial killer's reign of terror , which in the original timeline had been stopped at three murders , extends to ten victims . . . \nincluding john's mother . \nthis is director gregory hoblit's third film ( the other two being primal fear and fallen ) . \nwith all three , he's managed to attach himself to great scripts ( this one by toby emmerich , whose only previous movie experience was as a music supervisor on numerous new line films ) and add equally great direction . \nalso , he apparently likes to have his films wrap up with a kick-ass ending . \nfrequency is no exception , the ending is unpredictable and incredibly satisfying . \nhoblit is three for three , and i hope he can keep it up . \nnow everyone can argue logic this and logic that all you want with the sci-fi elements of frequency . \nbut the fact of the matter is that time travel has never been achieved . \nwho's to say how something works and how it doesn't when it's never happened ? \nis it because we've become accustomed to time travel \" laws \" from other places like \" star trek \" and the back to the future trilogy and \" quantum leap \" ? \nyes , if you sit down and think about it , certain plot elements in this film probably won't make any sense . \nmost films are like that . \ndon't let that dissuade you from seeing this fantastically entertaining film however . \nwhen frequency was over , it made me wish i had seen it with my father so i could have given him a hug ( okay okay , shut up ) . \nwhen you break it down past all its sci-fi elements and serial killer antics , frequency is simply a movie about a father and his son and the bond that they share . \nit's touching , it's sincere , and it's what ultimately makes this movie work . \n[pg-13] \n", "it must be tough to be a mob boss . \njust ask paul vitti ( robert deniro ) , a man who finds his job as mafia head to be rather stress inducing . \ni can believe it , too - one can't even begin to fathom the turmoil he must go through when he's forced to choose between an ice pick , baseball bat or sledgehammer to torture victims with . \nsuffering from reoccurring panic attacks , paul decides he needs to consult some professional help . \nand who better than billy crystal . \nafter appearing in bottom-of-the-barrel flops , father's day and my giant , crystal finally finds a reliable costar and some very promising material here . \nplaying vitti's private shrink , the two very different stars strike an unorthodox , but interesting relationship that carries this enjoyable comedy on a steady wave of laughs from start to finish . \ncasting robert deniro as paul vitti is something of an in-joke , i think . \nplaced in this mobster's shoes , deniro gets to spoof characters he himself played in films like the godfather , part ii and casino . \nit's obvious he's having a lot of fun doing so . \nthe man behind the camera is harold ramis , whose credits include ghostbusters ( as writer and star ) , and his best directing effort , the bill murray vehicle , groundhog day . \nramis has a knack for drawing laughs because he simply knows what's funny , and here he manages to accentuate the strengths of nearly all the actors . \nthe only character who weakens the payoff is crystal's bride-to-be ( lisa kudrow ) . \nplaying the same dumbed-down role as she does in friends , kudrow is amusing , but doesn't fit into this comedy mold as well as the director may have hoped . \nthe supporting cast sparkles . \njoe viterelli is hilarious as jelly , vitti's pea brained right-hand man , and chazz palminteri is a show stopper playing a fellow mobster who's in desperate need of the definition of `closure' . \nthe movie manages to maintain consistent chuckles throughout , putting the emphasis on 3 or 4 really big laughs that will have audiences grasping their sides . \nthe situation is just too cute to resist . \nit's unfortunate that the language gets somewhat out of hand . \nbut hey , if you're in the mafia , using obscenities probably comes naturally . \nand near the end , seeing billy crystal attempt to walk and talk like a mob boss is truly a special treat . \n", "the caveman's valentine starring samuel l . jackson , ann magnuson , aunjanue ellis , tamara tunie screenplay by george dawes green ,

the film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment , with romulus's \" caveman \" a slightly more mundane version of todd mcfarlane's urban noir hero , spawn . \nwith a long-vanished wife ( tamara tunie ) acting as a spiritual guide , the occasional social caste commentary , the secret base in a cave , a divergent genius personality with a network of informants and supporters , and a wickedly colourful arch-enemy , the film piles on the lurid comic book details and dizzying slapdash colours to such a lavish extent that i was vaguely surprised that the blue police cars weren't inscribed with \" gotham pd . \" \nthat being said , _the caveman's valentine_ can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy , a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart . \nthe difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when , in fact , _the caveman's valentine_ is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless ( again like mcfarlane's spawn ) while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts . \nit is no small detail that our hero , romulus , is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life ( in legend ) without knowledge of his royal birth , but also that our romulus has turned his back on the comforts of the literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park . in the romulus mythology , signs of romulus' royal blood is brought by twelve vultures , while in the film , the call to action for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds , but of the carrion itself . \nwhether or not romulus of _the caveman's valentine_ will found a nation , or , in the case of novelist george dawes green , upon whose novel his own screenplay is based , a franchise , the fact remains that _the caveman's valentine_ is easily the most misunderstood film of 2001 thus far . \nit , along with m . night shyamalan's _unbreakable_ , is a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format which has , since miller's seminal \" the dark knight returns \" , redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics . \nreaders of sam keith's brilliant \" the maxx \" comic series ( or of mtv's short-lived animated adaptation of the same ) are already familiar with the idea of a homeless man placed in the position of knight errant and king of his own twisted demesne . \nthe failure of both \" the maxx \" tv show and of _the caveman's valentine_ ( not forgetting the initial backlash against _unbreakable_ ) suggests that the public may not be ready for america's surprising contributions to dark fantasy . \nluxuriantly lit , brashly saturated , and comic-panel framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent ( _death in venice , ca_ ) , while inhabiting robin standefer's ( _practical magic_ ) mesmerizing sets , _the caveman's valentine_ is an unremittingly gorgeous film . \nkasi lemmons , following up her brilliant 1997 debut , _eve's bayou_ , which played on similar themes of manufactured realities and mysticism , fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs and lost boys , artists and suffering . \n_the caveman's valentine_ is an elegant and piquant expression of hope for justice in a tilted landscape . \nclearly not for every taste , when approached with the correct paradigm , it is one of the most stunning and intensely fascinating films of the year : a redefinition of the hero archetype for a post-modern audience with urine-stained wool trench coats in place of blue tights and red capes . \n_the caveman's valentine_ is a fine and a courageous film , crazy enough to suggest that the delirious yammering of an idiot savant is the best and truest paladin of order in the chaos of eliot's rat's alley wasteland . \n", "expand the final fifteen minutes of home alone into a feature-length film and you've got baby's day out--an agreeably amusing children's comedy about a bumbling band of kid kidnappers who are unwittingly outwitted by an innocent infant . \nthe plot tracks a trio of crooks-posed-as-photographers ( mantegna , pantoliano , haley ) who steal nine-month-old bennington august cottwell iv , aka baby bink , from his old-money home . \nbut the plan goes awry when baby crawls out an open window and into the streets of downtown chicago ! \nfollowing the path of his favorite story , called \" baby's day out , \" baby rides a bus and visits the zoo and winds up at a skyscraper construction site . \nwhile baby stays unscathed , the crooks fare worse for the wear . \nthe stooges get hit by boards and dropped from roofs and , of course , suffer multiple crotch injuries . \n ( john wayne bobbitt should probably steer clear of this one . ) \nlike he did in planes , trains , and automobiles , john hughes again demonstrates his mastery of the simple set-up and extended execution . \nhere , he's aided and abetted by a director , patrick read johnson , whose choreography could rival a coen brother . \nbest bit : baby crawling across a busy city street . \nbaby's day out has only two emotions--awww and ouch--and the actors play them accordingly . \nforget the cartoon concern of lara flynn boyle or cynthia nixon , disposable as mom and nanny , respectively , the ones to watch are the ones who are wincing . \njoe mantegna is a great head stooge , barking lines like \" that little doo-doo machine is my retirement money . \" \nbrian haley has a great scene with a gorilla , while joe pantolianto plays curly to mantegna's moe . \n * he * is funny . \nneedless to say , twins adam and jacob warton are adorable beyond belief . \n", "waiting at the train station near the beginning of fury , joe says : `after all , we're human . ' \nin the context of events to transpire , joe's line is prophetic , foreshadowing the internal conflict of the protagonist in the latter half of the film . \ndoes being human necessarily imply humane behavior ? \nthrough the baseness of human character exemplified in the formation of a mob , fritz lang prompts the viewer to consider whether our inclination towards impulsiveness supersedes our civility . \nexpressing his abhorrence towards the rise of nazism in his homeland , lang takes great care in creating a sense of discomfort during the scenes of mob hysteria . \nin the scene prefacing the lynching , the mob achieves critical mass at the bar . \ndeputy meyers is brought in as an exalted informant , but when he is unable to augment the mob's myth of joe , he is quickly renounced from his position as town gossip . \nwe see in a shot where two bar patrons are arguing that the deputy looks around nervously at the growing monster and then carefully slips out of the bar . \nwhat is quietly horrifying is the realization by both the audience and the deputy that the crowd no longer exists within the confines of reason and has succumbed to what the barber referred to as impulse . \nwhat once was excitement to the deputy has turned into fear with the realization that he is now powerless . \nto the audience , the deputy's quiet exit concurs with their own sinking feeling of uneasiness as the mob's delirium crescendos . \nlang educes this discomfort not through movement of the camera , but rather its stillness . \nthe shot's composition places the audience equidistant and directly across from the pair of arguing patrons and the deputy effectively becomes a mirror to our own apprehensions . \nas the intensity of the mob closes around deputy meyers , it does so around the viewer as well . \nthe stationary camera in this shot heightens our fears because when the deputy escapes , we are deserted by our reflection and the viewer becomes the sole proprietor of sensibility amongst a swarm of irrationality . \nbecause the camera does not track the deputy's movement , we are left with an amplified perception of desertion and vulnerability . \nas the bar scene progresses , the camera pans 180 degrees to reveal the fury of the mob . \nthis shot is unique because it is a point-of-view shot where the audience , not a character in the film is the subject . \nwhile a long , or dolly shot may objectively reveal the size of the mob , panning from the mob's belly distorts the audience's spatial reference and exaggerates the claustrophobia of the scene ; we feel we are at the epicenter of something infinitely large . \nwe see close shots of people's faces , contorted by their rage . \nwith the pivot of the pan being in the center of the mob and angry members within a short radius of the pan , lang offers the viewer a sense of what it feels like to be the subject of a lynching . \nin this shot the audience is at the mercy of the mob ; lang's camera makes us feel vulnerable and powerless as joe must have felt in the jail . \nin some greater sense , it must have been what lang felt when he saw his countrymen overcome with unjustifiable hatred towards their own humankind . \nlang's observations of his fellow man succumbing to mob behavior left him with an indelible image of malevolent human behavior . \nas joe faces his peril , trapped in his burning cell , his dog rainbow rushes to be by his side . \nlang makes rainbow a martyr to contrast his humanity against the recklessness of his human counterparts . \nusing his camera to create shots that elicit disturbing images of mob mentality , lang depicts man's volatility and `impulse' towards inconceivable cruelty . \nreprising joe' s line at the train station , we are induced to question why our primeval impulses so easily transcend our humanity . \n", "because the press screening of \" planet of the apes \" was one day past last issue's deadline , i was afforded the opportunity to see the film a second time , listen to audience reactions and read a heap of reviews before writing this piece . \nthe chief complaints of those who disliked the futuristic adventure appear to be that the movie focused on visuals instead of substance , that the story was thin , that mark wahlberg's character was colorless and that the surprise ending sucked . \nto those people i would like to say ? what the hell did you expect ? \nthis is a tim burton movie , boys and girls . \ntim burton movies have great art direction and thin , clunky stories . \nfor the blissfully nasty , disjointed and underrated \" mars attacks ! \" \n ( jonathan rosenbaum of the chicago reader and i were two of the only critics in america to praise the movie ) burton reportedly tossed vintage \" mars attacks ! \" \ntrading cards onto the floor and based his story on the ones that landed face up . \nburton's re-imagining of the 1968 story of an astronaut that lands on a planet where apes rule men looks great . \nthe apes , courtesy of make-up magician rick baker , are dazzling and ape city is a wonder to behold . \nlike astronaut leo davidson ( wahlberg ) , the film hits the ground running , whisking viewers through a head-spinning series of solid one-liners and engaging vignettes and establishing a sense of thrust that carries us through the more traditional fight scenes that come later . \nas for wahlberg , consider what burton does with his character . \nfrom his start as a filmmaker , burton has shown his fascination with colorful misfits ( pee-wee herman , the joker , ed wood , the ack-acking martians , etc . ) and lack of interest in standard issue heroes . \nso leo davidson spends most of the movie getting the living shit kicked out of him before the biggest guilt trip in history is dropped on his shoulders . \nas for lack of color , remember , leo only launches into space to get his monkey back . \nhe doesn't want to lead humanity and he isn't looking for romance from a pretty , but dull human ( estella warren ) or a dynamic ape ( helena bonham carter , terrific as an equal-rights activist ) . \nas a man who just wants out , wahlberg is focused , subtle and sly . \nthe surprise ending provides the requisite shock ( and some more dandy visuals , particularly of the approaching authority figures ) , but admittedly isn't nearly as satisfying as the one in the original . \nfor the original ending to work , we only had to make one simple connection , for this one , we have to write a whole new screenplay . \nthe 1968 \" apes \" boasted a handful of great scenes , cool looking monkeys , a deliciously hammy performance by charlton heston ( who appears uncredited here as an aged chimp on his deathbed , re-delivering a classic line ) and a killer ending . \nbut viewers had to suffer through numerous dull stretches punctuated by social and political messages delivered with the grace of a wrecking ball . \nthe 2001 \" planet of the apes \" offers a different set of great scenes , much cooler looking monkeys , fine acting from wahlberg , bonham carter , paul giamatti and tim roth , and a not so good ending . \nit also gives us another chance to experience the skewed vision of tim burton and that's nothing to complain about . \n", "in 1977 , something never though possible happened . \nthe film star wars was released , with extraordinary , never seen before techniques of special effects . \nthe film set a new standard for special effects in film . \nnot only did it set a standard for the special effects , it set a standard for film itself . \nthe plot is one of the most creative i heard ever . \nthe legend of star wars starts long ago with the jedi . \nthe jedi were warriors who were wiped out by the dark side . \ndarth vader is the leader of the dark side . \nben obi-wan kenobi , played by sir alec guinness , was one of those jedi who is still alive today . \ndarth vader was once a jedi , until he turned to the dark side . \nyears after the killing of the jedi , darth vader is still around causing trouble . \nr2-d2 and c-3p0 are both what we call \" driods \" , or robots that are of assistance to humans . \nwhile an attack on the ship that princess leia , played by carrie fisher , is aboard , she inserts a message to r2-d2 , who is also on the ship . \nto obi-wan kenobi pleading for help . \nthe princess is captured by vader , but r2-d2 and c-3p0 get away on an escape pod that eventually lands them on the remote planet of tatooine . \nthe jawas , or small creatures who sell droids , pick r2-d2 and c-3p0 up to sell . \nthey are bought by luke skywalker's ( mark hamill ) family . \nwhile luke is cleaning the droids , the message from princess leia is found . \nluke finds this obi-wan kenobi , and learns that obi-wan was a friend of luke's father , who is now dead . \nluke also learns his family was a jedi . \nafter luke's family is killed by tropps from the dark side , ben decides to put luke through training to stop the dark side and destroy them once and for all . \nben wants to create a new jedi . \nfirst , the two must find princess leia and serve her . \nhan solo , played by harrison ford , and his sidekick chewbacca , played by peter mayhew , are consulted about providing a ship to complete the tasks necessary . \nafter meeting up with leia , the film really picks up . \nluke continues his training as a pilot and to become a jedi , ben kenobi confronts darth vader , and many other interesting events occur . \nstar wars is an amazing epic . \nthe plot is so original and amazing , i cannot believe it . \nthe special effects , especially for its time , are wonderful and realistic . \nthe space scenes in particular are the most fun to watch . \nthe ships flown by all are very unique and creative . \nthe costumes are also out of this world . \nthe scenery is so different from anything i have ever seen before . \nthere are a variety of different very memorable set pieces that will stay with me forever . \nthe entire premise of star wars is amazing . \nthe creatures and droids that we see throughout the film are one of a kind . \neven the human characters are different . \nevery character is extremely likable and different from characters from other sci fi films . \nthe acting on everyone's part is great , especially that of sir alec guinness's . \neven though the concept is not realistic at all , it is pulled off very nicely . \nthe acting , setting , effects , costumes , and sound make it work . \nif any of these were messed up , star wars would have come off as one huge joke . \nthe ending works very well , and left it very open to the sequels that came afterward . \nin early 1997 , a special edition of star wars was released . \nthe film was re-mastered so it looked better than it did in 1977 . \na few creatures were added here and there , and even an entire deleted scene with han solo and jabba the hutt ( seen in return of the jedi ) was added to the film . \nthink that's enough ? \non may 19 , 1999 , star wars episode i : the phantom menace will be released , followed by two more films that will reveal what went on before a new hope . \nwith this , star wars is bound to become the greatest tale told in our time . \n", "if you want some hearty laughs , then rat race is the movie for you . \nthis unpretentious little comedy , which sneaks into theaters today with very little hype , will have you bouncing in your theater seat . \nand while the film fits neatly into the low-brow , slapstick school of comedy , one refreshing aspect is its lack of mean-spiritedness . \nthe plot follows a group of people chosen at random by an eccentric las vegas casino owner ( john cleese ) who must race from vegas to a bus station locker 700 miles away in silver city , n . m . \ninside the locker is a duffel bag containing $2 million . \nthe first one to open the locker , gets the bag and the money . \nwhat the group of participants doesn't know is that cleese's donald sinclair ( \" i can do anything i want - i'm eccentric ! \" ) is staging the race as a betting game for a group of high rollers at the hotel . \nthe participants include vera ( whoopi goldberg ) and merrill ( lanai chapman ) , a newly reunited mother and daughter ; disgraced pro football referee owen templeton ( cuba gooding jr . ) ; italian tourist mr . pollini ( rowan atkinson ) ; randy pear ( jon lovitz ) and his family ; the bumbling con men duane and blaine cody ( seth green and vince vieluf ) ; and cynical young lawyer nick shaffer ( breckin meyer ) . \nvarious amusing encounters and mishaps befall the participants en route to silver city . \nscreenwriter andy breckman adds a nice touch by not having the racers try to sabotage one another . \nthe most side-splitting situations involve vera and merrill's encounter with the squirrel lady , a nice nutsy cameo by kathy bates ; owen's commandeering a charter bus full of lucille ball look-alikes on their way to a lucy convention ; the cody brothers misadventures with a hot-air balloon , a flying cow and a monster truck ; and the pear family's stopover at a barbie museum , which turns out not to be what they think it is . \nthe pear family situation is a fine example of the way breckman's script builds the laughs . \nwithout going into detail , this bit segues from the museum to hitler's touring car , to eva braun's dark lipstick , to lovitz burning his tongue , culminating at a ceremony honoring world war ii veterans . \nrat race's cast is first rate . \ncleese is wonderfully devilish and madcap ; lovitz is , at first , a bit whiny , but his character grows on you ; gooding is having a fine romp ; and dave thomas almost steals the show as cleese's deadpan assistant , a man \" born without a personality . \" \nthe film is directed by jerry zucker , who knows something about comedy . \nalong with his brother , david , and friend jim abrahams , he was responsible for such hits as airplane ! \nand ruthless people . \na throwaway subplot , which is good for some laughs , features cleese and his buddies , betting on a series of outlandish situations , including one dealing with a hooker and pepto-bismol . \nthis is a fun little feature . \nthe only letdown comes at the finale , which is too touchy-feely and sweet , almost negating what came before it . \nrat race is a summer sleeper , but it will keep you awake , as will the laughter of those watching around you . \n", "i had a chance to see a sneak preview of city slickers ii on campus last night . \ni went in with the expectation of a film with the similar flavor which made the original such a success : personal growth and insightful humor about life . \ni came away somewhat disappointed in this regard , getting some of the latter and not much of the former . \nthe basic plot revolves around billy crystal , who plays mitch robbins , turning forty . \nhe's now become the station manager of the radio station in which he worked in the original . \nhe's given a job at the radio station to his best friend , played by daniel stern , out of sympathy while stern's character works through his divorce . \nhis loser younger brother ( john lovitz ) comes to mitch's house to bum a money and place to live , all while mitch and his wife try to celebrate his birthday . \nduring the celebration , mitch discovers what appears to be a treasure map in curly's ( the cattle drive leader in the original played by jack palance ) old hat . \nafter a business trip to las vegas , crystal , stern , and lovitz stay a few extra days to go off in search of the treasure . \non the way , they run into curly's twin brother , duke , played by ( you know who ) jack palance . \nfirst of all , the cinematography was beautifully done , especially the outdoor scenes in the desert . \nthe scenes are such that i would like to see some of those sights filmed myself . \nthere is some character development during the film . \nthe actors remain true to their characters and play them well , without overplaying the jokes . \nthe movie is a good basic adventure , with enough plot twists to provide for an ending that is difficult to predict . \nthe movie is paced well , but with a couple slow spots in the middle and towards the end . \nhumor-wise , the film has a good number of jokes which maintained my interest throughout the film . \nthere are memorable moments like when stern is bitten by a snake , but there are fewer jokes to laugh at in the sequel ( surprise , surprise for a sequel , right ? ) . \nhowever , the slight bitter aftertaste i have with this film has to do mainly with the film's manipulation of the audience . \nthe film tries to pull your heart-strings too much regarding how close the characters are to each other , like when mitch had decided to suck the snake marrow out of his best friend's butt . \nthis is done again when the gang meets up with some members of the cattle drive group from the original . \nthere were also some parts which appeared unrealistic , like whether the stampede would start in the way it did or why they didn't worry more about water while tromping around the desert . \nsome strenuous stretches of the imagination are required here . \nsince the objective of the gang is to find gold and get rich ( unlike finding themselves in middle age like in the original ) , i also found it harder to empathize with the characters during their journey . \noverall , i'd say that the film is an entertaining and humorous adventure with some story-line deficiencies making it less worthy than the original . \nit may be worth the full price of admission , but a matinee would be a better bargain . \n", "the \" submarine \" genre of movies seems to be one of the most intriguing and compelling types of storytelling there is . \nthink about it . . . \nthese films are completely based in reality , yet only a handful of people have ever been on one , making them fascinating to the general public . \nthey aren't like movies that take place on a plane or a train , as anybody can get on one of those . \nand they aren't like movies that happen in outer space either , because no one's done any of that stuff yet . \nwhen a new one comes out , you don't hear anyone say \" ugh , another submarine movie \" like people tend to say \" ugh , another boxing movie \" . \nlook at modern movies that involve submarines : das boot , the abyss , the hunt for red october , crimson tide . . . \nall are well regarded as top-notch entertainment . \ngladly joining that bunch is u-571 , which stars matthew mcconaughey as the executive officer of a u . s . naval submarine during world war ii . \nwe learn he has been denied a recommendation for his own command by his superior ( bill paxton ) . \nmcconaughey's crew then receives orders that they will be boarding a disabled german submarine to steal the enigma , a german communications encoding device that has stumped allied intelligence . \nthe mission goes horribly wrong however , and as a result , mcconaughey and only a handful of his crew ( as well as a captured german ) become trapped aboard the u-571 in enemy waters . \nthe first great thing about u-571 is the film's opening sequence . \nthe german crew of u-571 are under attack , which sets the events of the rest of the film into motion . \nit's tense , exciting and fascinating . \nand i applaud the filmmakers for not copping out and instead keeping the entire sequence in german with english subtitles . \nmost movies with a scene this long would have panicked and had the german crew speaking english right away . \nonce the plot gets moving , u-571 gives us action sequence after action sequence , making the audience wonder \" ok , now how do they get out of this ? \" . \nthe stakes keep raising ( much like in executive decision , an excellent action-thriller ) , and even though the audience knows how the film will end , it's a lot of fun getting there . \ni only have two minor complaints about the entire film . \nthe first comes from the scenes which follow the opening sequence . \nwhile their purpose is to introduce us to the characters and to get the story going ( which they do ) , i feel as though it could have been done much quicker , and less conventionally . \ni mean , did we really have to see the ship's crew at a wedding ? \nbecause of that , you now know exactly what's going to happen to the groom ! \nmy other gripe would be during the film's finale . \nthere's an explosion which ends the film that is one of the weakest looking cgi effects since the president's plane crashed into the ocean at the end of air force one . \ni cannot stress this enough . . . \nuntil a cgi effect can be made to look like a model effect , stick with using models . \nyes , u-571 is historically incorrect and there are surely some specifics in the plot that people who have been onboard a submarine will tell you \" that couldn't happen \" , but the overall point of this film is entertainment . \nit succeeds fantastically . \n[pg-13] \n", "we share the descent into darkness of a talented boy pianist . \nyears later we see his subsequent resurfacing ; in the mid 80's a damaged man walks out of a rainstorm and back into the world . \nthe movie charts the causes of his mental breakdown . \nbased on the life story of david helfgott , this australian film is a rich exploration of the pressures drilling in upon a child-genius , compounded by the looming shadow of a domineering father . \nin the 1950's helfgott emerged as a child prodigy . \nthe film traces his relationship with his father , whose encouragement comes at the cost of demanding david have no life beyond that of the black and white keys . \ndavid is offered places in the usa , but his father refuses to let him leave australia . \nthe effect this has upon helfgott is cleverly told via a single reverse tracked shot ; david is sobbing on the front doorway of his music teacher's house . \nhe is well lit via the external house lights . \nhis teacher isn't home . \nwe pull back and see that the dark front room's window has it's curtains open . \nthere , in a pool of blackness , is a grand piano . \ndavid's fall over the dark cliff has begun . \ninstead of being told in a linear mode , shine jumps around in time , ala \" pulp fiction \" . \nthis narrative device works well ; we see david as a boy , teenager in london and mental-patient in various snippets . \nthe film then neatly loops back for its uplifting conclusion . \nadult-helfgott's return to the light is told in linear fashion . \nthe lead role is played by 3 different actors , with the teenage-david ( taylor ) and adult-david ( rush ) standing out . \nwhilst rush is known for his tv work in australia , i think this is his first major cinema work . \nhis david , whilst clearly damaged - he keeps quoting his \" daddy \" in a babbling word torrent , cuddles strangers and grabs women on the breasts - is both touching and funny . \ntaylor's teenage-david is the more sympathy producing role . \nwe are mute witness to his gradual breakdown as the pressures just keep on building . \nhis father wants him to play the very demanding rachmaninov's 3rd , whilst his teacher wants to start him with a simple mozart . \ntechnically this is a beautiful film and a lot of thought has gone in to the production . \ni particularly like the use of slow motion and sound effects . \none scene has adult-helfgott happily babbling in a car in the rain . \nthe sound of the windshield wipers fades up over his voice . \nwith a clever subtlety , the wiper sound appears to morph into a rhythmic thumping , but of the same beat . \nthe image dissolves and we realise the thumping is the slow motion applause of a crowd . \nbut it's us being clapped . \nwe are young-david walking up to the stage for our first public show . \nthe music , as you would expect from a film of this subject matter , is critical . \nand it works very well . \nthe 'miming' of the actors piano playing is faultless ( apparently rush didn't mime ; he really did play ) \nhelfgott's life is certainly not without it's sympathetic people . \nindeed his return to the 'normal' world is accelerated by his chance meetings with two very special women . \nhis ultimately uplifting story is a magic piece of theatre craft . \nit shows that with the 'help of god' we can all find our way back home . \n", "today , war became a reality to me after seeing a screening of saving priivate ryan . \nsteve spielberg goes beyond reality with his latest production . \nthe audience is tossed about the theatre witnessing the horror of war . \nplease keep the kids home as the r rating is for reality . \ntom hanks is stunning as capt john miller , set out in france during ww ii to rescue and return home a soldier , private ryan ( matt damon ) who lost three brothers in the war . \nspielberg at time takes us inside the heads of these individuals as they face death during the horrific battle scenes . \nprivate ryan is not for everyone , but i felt the time was right for a movie like this to be made . \nthe movie reminds us of the sacrifices made by our ww ii fighting men and women . \nwe must not ever forget them as many gave the ultimate sacrifice , their lives so that we may live in freedom today . \nfor this i thank them and for steve spielberg for making a movie that i will never forget . \nthe academy will not forget tom hanks come april 1999 , as another well deserved oscar with be in tom's posession . \n", "well , i'll admit when i first heard about this film ( which

'volcano' and soon 'flood' and james cameron's extremly expensive 'titanic' \ni'll say first off i enjoyed 'volcano' much more than i did 'dantes peak' . \npart of that is just being biased as i usually enjoy anything that tommy lee jones appears in . \ni've been reading a lot about the movie being 'cheezy' or 'hokey' and really didn't see or think that once during the entire film . \ni get bored easily and this film didn't bore me for a minute . \nanother thing , and boy am i bitching today ! , that bothers me is when critics and such go on about \" well thats not really possible . \"

"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \nduring the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction , the cinematic output from its creator , quentin tarantino , has been surprisingly low . \noh , he's been busy -- doing the talk show circuit , taking small roles in various films , overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn , making cameo appearances on television shows , providing a vignette for the ill-fated anthology four rooms -- everything , it seems , except direct another feature-length film . \nit's been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr . tarantino's new feature film , jackie brown , one

airline in north america -- and she's just been caught at the airport by atf agent ray nicolette ( portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton ) and police officer mark dargus ( michael bowen ) smuggling $50 000 from mexico for gun-runner ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) . \nthe loquacious ordell , based out of a hermosa beach house where his horny , bong-hitting surfer girl melanie ( bridget fonda ) and agreeable crony louis gara ( robert de niro ) hang out , operates under the policy that the best rat is a dead rat , and he's soon out to silence jackie brown . \nmeanwhile , the authorities' target is ordell , and they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a half-million dollars . \nonly through a series of clever twists , turns , and double-crosses will jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses . \nalthough jackie brown marks mr . tarantino's first produced screenplay adaptation ( based on the elmore leonard novel \" rum punch \" ) , there's no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film . \nwhile he's adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense , the setting has been relocated to los angeles and the lead character's now black . \nin terms of ambiance , the film harkens back to the 1970s , from the wall-to-wall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to the nondescript look of the sets -- even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage 1970s productions . \nthe opening sequence featuring ms . grier wordlessly striding through the lax , funky music blaring away on the speakers , is emblematic of films of that era . \nthe timeframe for the film is in fact 1995 , but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro . \nof course , nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads , and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists , backstabbing , and deceptions deliciously unfold , the strength of jackie brown is the quiet , understated relationship developed between jackie and max ; when they kiss , it's perhaps the most tender scene of the year . \ntenderness ? in a quentin tarantino film ? \nsure , there've been moments of sweetness in his prior films -- the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer , or even in reservoir dogs , where a deep , unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel and tim roth characters -- but for the most part , mr . tarantino's films are typified by manic energy , unexpected outbursts of violence , and clever , often wordy , banter . \nthese staples of his work are all present in jackie brown , but what's new here is a different facet of his storytelling -- a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent , and a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation . \nthis effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr . tarantino as simply a helmer of slick , hip crime dramas with fast-talking lowlifes , and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent ; he's the real deal . \nthis new aspect of mr . tarantino's storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character -- that of the world-weary , sensitive , and exceedingly-professional max cherry , whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching . \nmr . forster's nuanced , understated performance is the best in the film ; he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie , we smile along with him . \nmuch press has been given about the casting of blaxploitation-era icon pam grier in the lead , with the wags buzzing that mr . tarantino may do for her what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travolta's then-sagging career . \nas it turns out , ms . grier is solid in the film's title role , although nothing here forces her to test her range . \ni do have to take exception to the claim that this film marks her career resurrection , though -- she's been working steadily over the years , often in direct-to-video action flicks , but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burton's mars attacks ! \nand larry cohen's original gangstas ( where she first teamed up with mr . forster . ) \nof course , it's true that her role here was a godsend -- a meaty a part as this is rarity for * any * actress , let alone one of her age and current status in the industry . \nwhile jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone , it marks tremendous growth of mr . tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly expanding , and whose characterizations have never been better . \nand while the film's narrative doesn't really warrant a running time of 155 minutes , it's filled with such sumptuous riches , ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack to entertaining , inconsequential conversations between the characters , that there wasn't an unengaging moment . \nwith an impressive trio of feature films under his belt , it'll be interesting to see what he tries next . \n", " \" last night \" could have an \" aka \" tagged on the end of it that says , \" it's the end of the world , and we feel fine \" . \n \" last night \" is about just that . \nthe last night of planet earth's existence . \nthe world is going to end at precisely midnight , january 1st , 2000 . \nhow scientists were so accurately able to predict when this catastrophic event would occur is never explained . \nnor is the event itself . \nthroughout the entire movie , no explanation is given as to why this is happening . \nin doing this , mckellar ( who also wrote and directed the film ) seems to be trying to transcend the genre . \nhe's attempted to make a film about people , and how each of them deals with their last night of life . \nthe film contains no science fiction elements , which allows the viewer to concentrate on the feelings and actions of the characters . \nmckellar is largely successful in his attempt to rise above his material . \nthe film is set in toronto , and follows several people in their various escapades on the last night of existence . \nthere's mckellar , who plays a man who just wants to be alone when the moment occurs , but keeps getting interrupted by a woman ( sandra oh ) in search of her husband . \nher husband , played by david cronenberg , is spending the day working at the gas company , informing people that they will attempt to keep providing gas right up until the end . \nfinally , there's mckellar's friend , played by callum keith rennie , a man who has spent his final months trying out every sexual perversion you can think of . \nmckellar has crafted a gang of the some of the most interesting characters i've seen in a film in months . \nthese people all felt real to me , especially the character played by sandra oh . \nwe can see her desperation , her utter need to be with her husband in the final hours . \nrennie is good , too , as the man who wants to literally try everything before he dies . \nhe exudes such charm and likeablity , it's not surprising that we're rooting for him to get what he wants . \nbut for me , the biggest surprise in the movie is mckellar . \ni knew that he was a talented director , but i had no idea he could act as well . \nhis insistence to be alone , much to the dismay of his parents , is something that most people would find difficult to understand , but as played by mckellar , we can understand his reasons . \nhe doesn't buy into the whole notion that just because everyone's going to die , he should immediately find some companionship . \nhe realizes the relationship would be forced , and they would only be together for the sake of being together . \nmckellar gives a brilliant performance , and i hope he alternates between directing and acting . \nmy only quibble with the film is that we never find out why the world is ending . \ni really wanted to know , and my need to know was hanging over the film at all times . \ni appreciate the fact that mckellar didn't want the material to rule the film , and that he wanted the movie to be more of a study in human behavious . \nhowever , in not telling the audience what the cause of earth's destruction is , he's left a big question that is in their minds throughout the film . \nanother problem is we never see anybody panicking . \ni would imagine if the world was ending , and there was nothing to be done about it , a large segment of the population would be going out of their minds . \ninstead , we are treated to shots of a giant crowd partying like it's new year's eve . \ni just didn't buy the fact that everyone had completely accepted their fate . \nno one had the urge to \" rage against the dying of the light \" . \ndespite these small problems , \" last night \" is one of the best movies of the year . \nas opposed to the moronic \" armageddon \" , \" last night \" treats the subject at hand with maturity and believabilty . \nand bruce willis never shows up to save the day . \n", " \" a bug's life \" may not be \" toy story , \" but it's more close than \" antz \" was . \ni really liked \" antz , \" basically because , yes , it is clever and witty and intelligent ( and it has the temerity to take a chance and put woody allen in the lead , perhaps the year's most inspired casting ) , but there was , in fact , something missing from it , and i'm the first to admit that . \nmaybe it's that it never totally lets go and takes off into real innocent fun - it's too obsessed with its orwellian message to become totally engaging , and if it weren't for woody allen , it would have been just a really clever good-not-great flick . \n \" a bug's life \" has a similar premise , and it also has disney to insure that it's g-rated and not totally over kids' heads like \" antz \" was ( not a bad thing , believe me ) , but what it also has is a tone that's completely innocent even when it's also remaining perpetually clever . \n \" antz \" is still the more witty film , and i love it for it , and \" a bug's life \" is more for general consumption , but it's also more entertaining . \nit broadens its horizons , and when it really moves from the ant colony , it really shows us a whole new world we've never seen before , and it's take on the evolution of bugs is a lot better than the one in \" antz . \" \nit's also light and clever . \nthe visuals are , instead of earth tones , bright worldly colors , and still gives the amazing visual technology of \" antz \" at least a worthy contender . \nthe characters are also nicely realized - though watered-down for broad consumption , they still carry more wit than the contemporary disney animated films . \nthe lead character , flik ( voiced by dave foley ) , is nothing more than a slightly-less neurotic z from \" antz , \" but foley makes him nearly as engaging as allen made z . instead of gene hackman playing the villain , we get the much more menacing kevin spacey as the lead grasshopper , the nicely-titled hopper . \nand for the romantic lead , we don't get spacey sharon stone , but intelligent and hard-to-get julia-louis dreyfuss , who doesn't even come around until the very final frames . \nnot that the plot's really any better than the one in \" antz \" - it's basically yet another redux of \" the seven samurai , \" with an ant colony under the control of giant grasshoppers forcing them to produce a product for them or else . \nwhen flik , a bone fide inventor , creates a time-conserving apparatus that accidentally destroys the season's donation , he puts them all in risk , and is sent away so that he won't screw anything up with the pretense that he is searching for help to fight the grasshoppers . \nhe runs into a group of \" warrirors \" who are , unbeknownst to him , a group of carnival bugs , and they agree to help under similar false pretenses . \nthese bugs are an equally wonderful assortment to anything in \" toy story \" : foppish walking stick slim ( david hyde-pierce ) , german caterpillar heimlich ( joe ranft ) , quick-tempered and insecure male ladybug francis ( denis leary ) , pretentious praying mantis manny ( jonathan harris ) , his assistant butterfly hypsy ( madeliene kahn ) , spider rosie ( bonnie hunt ) , and two fleas , tuck and roll ( michael mcshane ) , who speak in undiscernable jibberish . \nthe writers lightly touch on each bug's place in bug society and the malleability thereof while making a wisecracks at everything they can , and blowing the audience away with wild visual treats . \ngrasshoppers jumping in unison seems like a menacing earthquake . \na small bird becomes an ominous mortal threat , whose usual mild-mannered squeal is a scream of death . \nthe bug city is a modern-day metropolis , complete with fireflies temping as traffic lights and a fly sitting on the curb , holding out a cup , with a sign lying next to him that says \" kid tore off wings . \" \nand a rainstorm is like a giant flood , with each drop acting like a small bomb dropped at millions of miles per hour . \naround this , the pixar animators stage several large set pieces , like a resuce mission halfway through that is as wild and entertaining as anything this year , and a wonderfully exciting action piece at the end , a chase scene at night through the labyrinthine branches of a small thicket . \nmeanwhile , each character gets the spotlight to be completely idisyncratic and interesting , something \" antz \" couldn't do , and by the end , over the end credits , \" a bug's life \" pulls it's final punch , out clever-ing \" antz \" with a series of incessantly hilarious faux-bloopers that come just at the right time , when those who leave immeadiately after the final frame of a film have left , and you can brag that you were one of the elite who stayed and got the full money's worth of entertainment . \nstill , it's no \" toy story . \" \nthat film , maybe above any animated film i've ever seen , encompassed almost true perfection in story , character , and wit . \nit proved that it didn't need to brag about it's cutting edge technology to really soar ( it's the least visually striking of the three computer animated films thus far , but is still the most satisfying ) , and created a perfect world of idiosyncratic delights and innocent fun . \nyet \" a bug's life , \" as well as \" antz , \" are still amazing films , and prove without doubt , that if you're gonna make a computer animated film , send it to the guys who created these three flicks , evne if they're not working under the same roof . \n", "when i saw the trailer for \" the sixth sense , \" i didn't expect much from it . \nmy snap judgment was that it was a watered-down version of \" the shining \" or possibly a late-entry in the glut of angel-related movies/tv shows of a couple years ago . \nbut all the buzz motivated me to give it a shot . \nit turned out to be one of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year . \nbruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe . \nat the beginning of the movie , he is admiring an award the city has given him for his work , but he is soon confronted by vincent , a patient malcolm failed years earlier ( donnie wahlberg-former new kid-in an impressive cameo ) . \na year passes , and malcolm is treating another child with the same symptoms vincent displayed . \ncole sear ( haley joel osment ) is a withdrawn kid who is called \" freak \" by the other boys in the neighborhood . \nweird things seem to happen around cole-his mother ( olivia williams ) leaves the kitchen for a moment and returns to find every cabinet and drawer open even though cole hasn't moved-and cole seems to know things that a kid his age shouldn't-for example , that there was once a gallows in his school . \nhe steals religious icons from churches to build a chapel in a pup tent in his bedroom . \nthe trailer gave away the movie's first major plot twist . \nif it hadn't , the first hour of the movie would be more engrossing because we wouldn't know what's wrong with cole . \nif you're lucky enough to have not seen the trailer , stop reading this review right now and go see \" the sixth sense . \" \nanyway , since the trailer gave it away , i figure it's fair game to discuss here . \nonce malcolm gains cole's trust , cole reveals his secret : he sees ghosts everywhere . \ndead people wander around not knowing that they're dead , invisible to everyone except cole . \nmalcolm gradually begins to realize that cole is telling the truth . \nthe box office success of \" the sixth sense \" has generated a lot of press about how horror movies rule the box office this year and lots of theories about why that's so . \ni hate to burst anybody's bubble , but \" the sixth sense \" isn't really a horror film . \nat its core , \" the sixth sense \" is a touching story of how a troubled kid and an emotionally-scarred adult help each other to move past their problems . \nsome scenes with the ghosts are wonderfully creepy , though . \none that really got to me : the ghost of a boy says to cole , \" i'll show you where my dad keeps his gun \" ; when the ghost turns , we see the bullet wound in the back of his head . \nosment gives the best performance i've ever seen from a child actor . \nit's hard enough to find a grown-up in hollywood who can give a subtle , realistic portrayal ! \nalthough willis gets top billing , cole is really the protagonist of the story , and osment truly brings the complex kid to life . \nif only willis' work were as impressive . \naccustomed to delivering catchphrases rather than dialogue , willis is stiff and awkward as malcolm , his most challenging role to date . \n ( this is a bad omen for his next movie , \" the story of us , \" which chronicles the ups and downs of a marriage ) . \nwriter/director m . night shyamalan has a light , poetic touch that goes to the heart of the viewer without seeming sappy or trite . \nhe's also a skillful storyteller , as the movie's ending demonstrates . \nonly when the final secret is revealed do you realize that shyamalan has been hinting at it throughout the movie . \nlook for a cameo by the director as a doctor who treats cole . \nbottom line : osment should get an oscar nomination , and you should go see this movie . \n", "near the end of frank capra's holiday classic , its a wonderful life , george bailey ( jimmy stewart ) is feeling down . \nhe has devoted his life to others , and never fulfilled his dream of leaving his small supburb town , bedford falls . \nstanding upon a bridge above stormy waters , he looks down , contemplating suicide . \nhe has potential he hasn't fulfilled -- yet , he has done so much for others . \nas a young chap , his ambition was to leave his hometown of bedford falls . \nbut times and ambitions change . \nthings happen , and he's stuck . \nhis guardian angel is there , and shows him that . . . it's \na wonderful life . \nin a whirlwind tour of the town , george sees what life would be like without him . \nhe learns the moral lesson , that to live is a gift . \nhis earthly problems are solved . \nthe climatic scene is a marvel . \nfrank capra's film is a centenial classic -- watched and re-experienced by every generation . \nwonderful life is one of the few pictures of times gone by that seems as fresh , maybe fresher , then it did when it was first released . \nmany films of the thirties through seventies have aged poorly . \nbut this one is a near flawless example of how well a perfect script and timing can mesh with first-rate acting , wit and suspense , glorious music , and terrific set peices . \nthe only even slightly dated scenes are those at the begining in which god has a long chat with clarence , george's guardian angel . \nthey aren't all that bad , but they remain corny and a little out of place . \nnevertheless , this is one film that deserves its place in time , cinema history , and our hearts . \nit can be equally appreciated by anyone of any age . \nhere is one genuine masterpeice , a classic that reaches heights and ambitions near perfection . \nthis crackling good mixture results in a film which is at once funny , exciting , moving and uplifting . \nthe film itself is almost a reversal of the life of george bailey -- there isn't too much to it , but capra and the gang ( various screenwriters , composers , actors ) plumet the material to its fullest potential . \nthe result is a film -- though not at first intended to be pigeon-holed as a holiday film -- that will always be remembered , celebrated , and loved . \n", "jerry springer has got nothing on \" wild things . \" \njohn mcnaughton's new thriller tackles more tawdry themes in less than two hours than springer's notoriously sleazy talk show broadcasts in two weeks -- bisexuality , threesomes , poolside catfights , slutty rich bimbos , even redneck gator-wrestling , they're all part of the movie's raucous , complex storyline . \nbut even trash tv topicality can't drag \" wild things \" down -- this crazy campfest plays like something you'd find late-night on the usa network , only infinitely more palatable and with a solid ensemble cast . \ndespite a smattering of needless scenes ( most of them sexual in nature ) , there's wicked fun to be had here . \n \" wild things \" would be a guilty pleasure , only there's no guilty feeling involved in having a good time with it . \nhigh school guidance counselor sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) is well-liked in the town of blue bay , especially by pretty , popular kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , whose family name is among the florida yachting enclave's most financially prominent . \nhoping to take her crush to a physical level , kelly seductively slinks into lombardo's house after washing his jeep for a fundraiser , but , the very next day , tearfully admits to her trollop mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped . \nbefore long , blue bay detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) are listening to similar allegations from kelly's rebel classmate suzie toller ( neve campbell ) . \nlombardo , who maintains his innocence , hires neck brace-sporting , opportunistic lawyer ken bowden ( bill murray ) to defend him in court . \nthe previews give away the following revelations , so if you haven't seen any of the movie's spots on the television or in the theater , you might want to skip to the next paragraph . \nwhile cross-examining suzie on the witness stand , bowden gets her to break down and admit that the alleged rapes never took place -- that kelly had concocted this entire scheme because she was angry that lombardo was sleeping with her mother and not with her . \nto pay lombardo for the damages , kelly's mother breaks her daughter's trust fund and gives him $8 . 5 million . \nbut lombardo , kelly and suzie are actually all working together , and plan to take the money and run as fast as they can . \nduquette and perez , however , begin to suspect that there's more afoot to the case than just false accusations . \nif there's a major drawback to \" wild things , \" it's that it's oversexed to a fault . \nthe much-talked-about hotel room menage-a-trois between dillon , campbell and richards is a turn-off . \nit's also cut short ( sorry , guys ) , and should have been cut shorter -- the movie grinds to a halt for pure titillation once too often . \nwhat we don't see is far more effective than what we do . \nanother example of this is kevin bacon needlessly going the full monty in a shower scene . \ner , no thanks . \nalso , bacon's duquette feels simultaneously underdeveloped and overwritten . \ndaphne rubin-vega , from broadway's \" rent , \" tries to compensate for a superfluous character . \ntheresa russell is just plain wooden . \nand when , in the end , all is out in the open , ask yourself if certain scenes involving these three were really necessary . \nbut what keeps the movie from being throwaway junk is an engaging chain of surprises ( some predictable , some not ) that never seems to end . \n \" wild things \" has more twists than a crate full of corkscrews , and most are so gleefully , over-the-top nasty that you can't help but be charmed by their absurd showmanship . \na great deal of amusement also comes from watching bill murray in a supporting part that appears to have been written for his sly comedic talent ; murray's a stitch , especially when pulling up beside the van ryan limo after winning lombardo's case and flipping them off . \nand don't leave when the closing credits hit the screen , or you'll miss the film's best part -- four bonus flashbacks that smooth over plot holes while offering a few more tiny turns , plus a final scene that caps everything off with a great stunner of a bombshell . \nspeaking of bombshells , denise richards , who plays almost every scene in a blue bikini top , does the teen tease thing with a malicious allure that she was never allowed to flaunt in \" starship troopers . \" \nmatt dillon flexes his sleepy-voiced sex appeal , and pulls off personality changes with chameleonic precision . \nneve campbell , lovely as ever except when sporting a blond wig , gives suzie a vengeful vulnerability that makes her the most interesting member of the conspiring trio . \nre-edited and toned down a bit , the dynamics between these three actors could have carried the film to greater lengths . \nbut what we're given works well enough . \n \" wild things \" is highly entertaining and , indeed , very wild . \n", "the happy bastard's 30-second review \nbig daddy \nhappy gilmore as a father ? \nof course ! \nthat's the latest scenario presented by adam sandler in the new movie big daddy , a movie that's passable but isn't really considered some of sandler's best work . \nhe doesn't actually play happy gilmore in the movie , but a variation of him . \nhe's sonny coufax , a man who's living off a settlement he got for a cab running over his foot and his one-day-a-week gig as a tollbooth man ( tollbooth willie ? ) . \nhis girlfriend ( kristy swanson ) is fed up with his lifestyle and demands a change before she leaves him . \nenter a 5-year old kid , who's mysteriously dropped at his doorstep and intended for his preppy roommate ( jon stewart ) , who's off in china on a business trip . \nfrom there , coufax basically acts as the kid's father , teaching him different things like peeing on the side of a building and tripping up skateboarders with sticks . \nhe even manages to use the kid in a sort of con game to get the attention of a beautiful law office worker ( joey lauren adams ) , but , somehow , he also garners the attention of social services , who aren't particularly pleased with coufax's actions , as he pretends to be his roommate to keep the kid . \nthe reason i say it's not really sandler's best work is because it gets really sappy towards the end of a movie , showing some odd feelings that somehow didn't really belong in a sandler vehicle . \ni mean , it fits the movie's tone and everything , and sandler handles it well , but it's just oddly placed , that's all . \nfortunately , it doesn't destroy the goofy glee path it's been following and it still makes you feel good . \nsandler does a good job here , as he does in most of his movies . \nrob schneider , however , is irritating as his friend , an immigrant delivery boy who can't read . \nstewart , in his minor time on screen , is great , and adams remains a joy to watch . \nlook for steve buscemi as well as a homeless bum . \nhe's a hoot . \ndirected by dennis dugan ( director of happy gilmore ) , the movie remains a good couple of hours to pass the time with . \nagain , there are faults , but , hey , everyone needs to get emotional sometimes . \n", " \" six days , seven nights \" is a summer movie that gets the summer movie experience deliciously right , a commendable achievement considering the season thus far has been littered with some pretty uneven fare . \nhere's a genuinely fun fluff piece that knows it's fluff , recognizes it's fluff and is admittedly proud to be fluff . \nof course , the casting of harrison ford in the broadly comedic lead role plays a sizeable part in the movie's success ; ford is such a concentrated dramatic actor that it's easy to forget what a funny guy he can be . \nas his female counterpart , anne heche also deserves a big pat on the back for her sweet , goofily charismatic performance . \nthe age difference ( ford's 56 , heche's 29 ) matters not -- these two click in a charged way that's hard to come by . \nthe story is a no-brainer -- ford stars as gruff but loveable island aviator quinn harris , while heche is career-minded but loveable new york magazine editor robin monroe . \nrobin , on a tropical vacation with fianc ? frank ( david schwimmer ) , gets assigned to supervise an emergency photo shoot in nearby tahiti , so she reluctantly hires quinn to fly her there . \nthe plane crashes during a terrible storm , and they immediately find themselves stuck in a deserted paradise with few ideas on getting back to civilization . \na series of unpleasant , often hilarious catastrophes leaves little choice but for both members of this unlikely odd couple to fall for each other . \nmeanwhile , back at the resort , frank is tempted himself by quinn's shapely female tagalong ( jacqueline obradors ) . \nthat subplot obviously exists to get us rooting for the quinn-robin pairing , and while it makes for a few good laughs early on , it eventually becomes a contrived distraction from the far more engrossing misadventures of quinn and robin . \nand since the film spends most of its time with the castaways , this flaw is only a minor inconvenience . \ndirector ivan reitman keeps the pace brisk . \nat a slim 101 minutes , \" six days , seven nights \" never wears out its welcome , where a lesser film could have felt like it was as long as its title . \nmichael browning's clever screenplay allows for plenty of notable one-liners ( my favorite , taken in context , is \" you mean _arrrgh_ pirates ? \" ) , and though it essentially boils down to one mishap after another , they're all quite engaging . \neven the movie's more \" serious \" moments are played with a wink . \nheche has been under undeserved fire over whether or not her private life with ellen degeneres would affect the \" believability \" of \" six days , seven nights \" ' heterosexual pairing . \n ( so she's a lesbian . \nso what . \ndeal with it . ) \nof course it doesn't , and here , her naysayers are proved wrong in a big way . \nin fact , her chemistry with ford is what really makes the film click ; these opposites attract with the utmost , endearing electricity . \nat one point , when the two are discussing the likelihood of romantic interest , heche asks ford how old he is . \nafter several wrong guesses ( \" forty-five ? \n_fifty_ ? \" ) , he whispers his age to her . \n \" you still look good , \" heche stammers . \n \" i still _am_ good , \" ford replies . \nshe's good too , and together , they make \" six days , seven nights \" one memorable ride . \n", "the release of dolores claiborne into wide release this weekend adds another entry into the long list of film adaptations of stephen king's work . \nthis slow-moving character study provides some outstanding acting performances by the principals , but suffers from a tepid conclusion , inconsistent direction , and may not have wide commercial appeal . \nwhen the maid , dolores claiborne , is found brandishing a rolling pin standing over the bloody and dead body of her employer , it seems like an open-and-shut murder case . \nupon hearing of the death via a mysterious fax , dolores' estranged and bitter daughter , esquire magazine writer selena st . george , returns from new york back to her tiny island village childhood home . \nas the two clash horns , the story behind the mysterious death of dolores' abusive husband two decades ago , ruled an accident despite the protests of detective john mackey , is revealed . \ndid dolores kill her husband ? \nand did she kill her employer ? \ndolores claiborne is certainly more of a character study than a suspense thriller . \nconsequently , it is fortunate that their cast includes some of hollywood's finest character actors , such as bates , leigh and strathairn . \nkathy bates plays the film's title character , and gives a sensational lead performance . \ndolores claiborne is essentially a showcase for the talent of bates , as her character has a huge amount of screen time . \nshe dominates the screen , producing a character that is compelling and arresting , as we watch the character go through two decades of history via flashbacks . \nkathy bates' performance is award-calibre stuff . \nthe rest of the cast is also very good . \njennifer jason leigh plays the perpetually sour , bitter helena st . george well , and christopher plummer seems to be enjoying himself as dolores' ever-present nemesis , the determined detective john mackey . \ndavid strathairn is particularly interesting and suitably smarmy and despicable as dolores' husband , joe st . george . \njudy parfitt is fine as dolores' tyrannic socialite employer , vera donovan--it would have been interesting to see , say , meg foster in this role . \nchild actor ellen muth is also worth noting as the young selena during the flashback sequences ; she is very impressive . \nthe direction of dolores claiborne by taylor hackford wildly varies throughout the film , ranging from some parts which are quite clever in their own right , to parts which are embarrassingly hokey . \nthe segues between flashbacks and the present are very hit-and-miss in terms of effectiveness . \nthe pacing of the film tends to be numbingly slow , which tends to undermine any suspense which might be built up . \nhowever , the cinematography by gabriel beristain is wonderful--i particularly like the chilling ice-blue hue permeating the present-day scenes , contrasting well with the many nova scotia ocean shots--and danny elfman provides a surprisingly understated score for the film . \nit would seem that the commercial potential of dolores claiborne is limited . \nnone of the performers in the film could be classified as a big draw , and its pacing may be a turn-off to those expecting a gripping suspense film filled with twists and turns and car crashes and axe-wielding psychopaths . \nalthough being essentially the only film in its genre in release now , it may also be hurt by the negative perception of king works , even with the recent critical success of the shawshank redemption and the stand . \ndolores claiborne suffers from a very unsatisfying conclusion , and moves very slowly . \nhowever , the performances are uniformly excellent , particularly kathy bates , and the film has its moments . \non my four-star scale , i give dolores claiborne three stars . \n", "seen september 13 , 1998 at 4 p . m at rotterdam square mall cinema 6 , theater #2 , with chris wessell for free using my sony/loews critic's pass . \n[theater rating : * * 1/2 : good seats , average sound , picture unstable] \n \" rounders \" is exactly the kind of movie parents don't want their kids to see . \nit's not that it's a drunken orgy of sex and violence , but because it's a film that flat-out says you can make a career out of gambling . \nand to take make things \" worse \" it proves this through its original , fascinating story . \nthere have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the \" noir \" mood , that is , the dark , shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life . \nthis film starts off in the tradiational noir style , introducing us to the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing . \nmatt damon stars as mike mcdermott , a 20-something law student in present-day new york city who tells us how the game of poker is really played . \ndamon narrates throughout the film , but the entire opening scene is voiced-over so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting . \nmike's about to go up against teddy kgb ( malkovich ) , a russian gangster who looks like a serial killer . \nbut then again , he practically is one and the film does everything to convey that sense - the look in his eyes , his slow movements , his intricate mannerisms - all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld ( literally ) . \ndamon in the flesh might seem a little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectly-groomed features , but his narration is what brings it all together . \nhe never sounds like he's reading from a script , nor that he's trying to embellish anything , it just comes natural to him . \nthe screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood , from the smell of the air , to the logic involved in reading the other guys' faces and cards , and all without sounding remotely trite . \nimmediately we get the sense that poker isn't for gamblers , but for near- geniuses with nerves of steel . \nthe game is a quiet war , with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers . \nthe gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car , but when it comes to the game of poker , all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man . \nthe film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act . \nit concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble a bit . \nwe learn only a little about mike , both past and present . \npresently we know he has a girlfriend named jo ( gretchen mol ) who he constantly argues with over his gambling . \nthey go through a few break-up/make-up cycles until mike's childhood pal and fellow rounder \" worm \" ( norton ) is released from prison . \nit's not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars to the mob , but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such a predictable element and execute it the way it does . \ntechnically , the plot isn't unlike many children's sitcoms in which the \" good \" kid's \" bad \" friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid . \nwhat this film does is use a different medium to tell that story . \nmike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives , but both share a passion for out-thinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them . \nwhere as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating ( hence his jail time ) , mike always takes the cards he's dealt and works with them . \nsometimes they pay off ( i . e . \nhis ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling money ) , but other times they don't ( i . e . \nthe fact he takes himself out of the game and works a steady job after dropping $30 , 000 on a single hand ) . \nonce things start happening the film is able to expand and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail and mood . \nmike and worm bob and weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places , from socialites' mansions , to taking the tourists at atlantic city , to outwitting the gangsters that control it all . \neverything they come into contact with is a big poker game in that everything's a battle against the cards destiny deals . \none scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by a judge ( martin landou , in a perfectly cast and performed role ) that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the same time . \nmatt's good at gambling but he's also got potential to be a great lawyer . \nhe could go professional as either , but with one he could lose everything or win big , but with the other there's stability but not much risk involved . \ncan someone who's gambled his entire life really cash in his chips and leave ? \nif the film had been just a subtle lesson in poker-playing , then the ending is our test . \neverything is told from mike's perspective , but we're finally able to recognize some things on our own . \nthis makes the final , against-all- odds showdown seem like just that . \nit works just like the game it revolves around - showing us some of the cards , but still evokes the element of the unknown , and the consequences thereof . \nwhat separates \" rounders \" from most other films about games is the fact the challenge and the skills are more important than winning in the end . \n", "there was a lot riding on this movie . \neveryone even moderately interested in the \" scream \" series was dying to know how it would end . \nwhat would be the \" final act \" ? \nthis is the end of an era for them , a movie which has kept them up nights searching for clues on the internet , talking and tossing around rumors with their equally enthused buddies , and , for kids under 17 , those elaborate plots consisting of buying a ticket to one movie and hopping into \" scream \" while narrowly escaping those menacing ushers who are only a year or two older than themselves . \nno need to worry ; \" scream 3 \" is endlessly inventive and entertaining , a fine epilogue to the series that made kevin williamson a household name , reinvented the horror genre , and continued in the self-referential , post-modern tradition of quentin and co . \nso , how does the story go ? \nas opposed to what some fanatical internet sites would have you believe , sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , now all-grown-up and constantly dealing with her pass in the constantly tormented sector of her psyche , is not living in hollywood fulfilling her dream to become an actress , but rather in upstate california , living , understandably , alone in the confines of fences and vast security systems . \nshe works at home as a crisis center affiliate over the phone . \nbut that ? ? ? s not where the movie starts off . \ninstead , in a tactic that reminded me of the somewhat similar , and conceptually horrifying , sequence in \" eye for an eye \" ( 1995 ) , cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , now a big star , drives home to his girlfriend in traffic when the killer calls , demands the location of sidney ? ? ? s home , and , when he doesn ? ? ? t get it , threatens the life of cotton ? ? ? s girlfriend christine , and cotton can ? ? ? t do anything to stop him . \nthe rest of the sequence is particularly clever , setting up a constant throughout the picture : the killer has a high-tech electronic voice-changer that tops that of the first two . \nnot only does he sound unmistakably like talented voice-over artist roger jackson ( ha , ha ) , he can now easily duplicate the voices of the lead characters , including sidney , and the returned gale weathers ( courtney cox arquette ) and dewey riley ( david arquette ) . \nat the same time , stab 3 , the third film-within-a-film based around the characters and events of woodsboro and windsor college , has taken a less authentic approach this time around in return to woodsboro ; whereas the account of the first two films was true , the franchise within \" scream \" has now become totally fictional . \nnevertheless , we learn , cotton made an appearance in the movie which is now in production , as himself to be killed off in the first scene . \nso , it seems that the real killer is offing our heroes in the order in which they bite it in the movie ? ? 'either the actor portraying them , or the real thing . \nsometimes both . \nclever , indeed . \nbut , who goes next ? \nno one knows . \nthree different scripts were penned , we ? ? ? re told , to keep the true finale off the internet ( a nod to the \" scream \" 2 fiasco a few years back ) and no one knows for sure which one the killer read . \nstill , all the while sidney stays concealed in her home , only visiting dad for the first half-hour of the film , while also having horrifying visions of her mother , which takes us back a bit to sidney ? ? ? s fear of becoming what her mother was ? ? 'or , at least , what her mother was secretly . \nwhen sidney finally ventures out to hollywood as the murders become more prevalent , she ? ? ? s chased onto the set of stab 3 , wandering through \" woodsboro , \" written and directed as an odd , surreal , nightmare indeed , this is one of \" scream 3 \" ? ? ? s finest moments . \nokay , over the years , i ? ? ? ll admit that i ? ? ? ve become quite the \" scream \" fan . \nno , i don ? ? ? t have the ghostface costume or the director ? ? ? s cut laserdisc , but i often find myself compelled to pop in the dvd of either member of the preceding duo , and can get quite caught up in the dramatic element of these films ( yes , i said \" dramatic element \" ) , sometimes debating with family and friends the possibilities and endless theories that have become quintessentially affiliated with \" scream \" . \nthroughout the film , though , i noticed a much more subtle approach than the other two films . \ngranted that there ? ? ? s stabbin-a-plenty going on throughout , but there ? ? ? s considerably less blood , less gore . \nhonestly , i like this approach . \nit ? ? ? s more classical , more rebellious , constantly demonstrating the capable direction of wes craven . \nhe knows when to hold back and at the same time makes the movie ooze with energy , illustrating the delicate poise flowing from his years of experience . \nsome critics have noted that \" scream 3 \" seems to take itself more seriously this time ; maybe so , or maybe screenwriter ehren kruger ( arlington road ) , who took over after williamson had scheduling conflicts , saw an opportunity for true irony ? ? 'maybe even a little bit of satire ? ? 'if the film worked in a few more clich ? ? s . \nwhat puts a damper on this otherwise exceptional and creative film , i ? ? ? m afraid , is the ending , or , rather , the identity of the killer . \nit does the job , i guess , accomplishes what it should , bringing the three films full circle , but upon my first viewing it seemed rather dissatisfying because it appears a little too contrived , too arbitrary ; after a second viewing , which i endeavored upon due to this recurring disapprobation , the killer ? ? ? s identity still seems a little too random , but his motivation came across more sound this time around , and the eventual conclusion was ultimately more satisfying . \nall in all , \" scream 3 \" does not fall victim to the most lamented principle of a trilogy : it is not the worst of the films . \nas a trilogy , \" scream \" was a lot of fun ; refreshing , humorous , offbeat . \nalmost sad to see it go . \nbut then , it does seem best to quit while you ? ? ? re ahead , and \" scream 3 \" does a fine job of providing closure to its characters . \nfor now , \" scream \" holds the title as the finest series of horror films to be committed to celluloid . \nnot too shabby . \n", "ingredients : pouring rain , small flooded town , damn about to burst , bad guys going after millions of dollars \nsynopsis : at one point in the story townsperson karen asks hero tom

\nrelax , take your shoes off , and break out the popcorn . \n", "although many people have compared this new gangster comedy to the hit hbo drama 'the sopranos , ' analyze this is witty and entertaining enough to be a good movie in it's own right . \nbilly crystal plays wiseguy shrink ben sobol , who new 'patient' happens to be gangster boss paul vitti ( de niro . ) \nben wants nothing to do with vitti , as he's about to get married to laura macnamara ( kudrow ) and having a gangster as a patient wouldn't really help . \nbut ben is soon drawn into vitti worlds , and reluctantly helps vitti to sort his life out . \nall done in a comic fashion , of course . \nalthough never brilliant , analyze this is also never rubbish , which makes for a fun ride . \nbilly crystal , who hasn't had a good role since city slickers way back in the early '90's , is given a role that lets him fully exploit his wiseguy act . \nhe's pretty funny while he does it , and although his character is a little close to his character in city slickers , he's pretty funny . \nrobert de niro is hilarious as vitti , playing it dead straight but coming off as really funny . \nhe's a serious gangster unaware that he is a comic gold mine . \nlisa kudrow , barely seen as crystals' estranged wife to be , basically reprises her phoebe role from t . v series friends , which is getting rather tiresome , and doesn't come off well on the screen . \nthe supporting cast is apparently made up of the entire cast of casino and goodfellas , and are all funny caricatures , especially vitti's bodyguard jelly ( joe viterelli . ) \nthe film genuinely plays like a proper gangster movie , but with laughs instead of hard ass talking . \nit sometimes gets a little bloody for a light hearted film , but it strangely fits in . \nspoofs are made of famous gangster movies , including a nice parody of the godfather . \nthe italian tunes playing throughout the soundtrack contribute to the fun . \nthere's also some odd plot points : fbi guys appear and suddenly disappear for no apparent reason . \nit is true that analyze this has had a somewhat chequered production history , and perhaps the plot points were expanded in a earlier version of the script . \nunfortunately , this is hollywood , so we will never know . \nharold ramis , best known as egon from ghostbusters , has a deft touch with directing comedy , as shown in the immortal groundhog day , and the less immortal caddyshack . \nall the comic potential in a scene is dug out and presented to the audience . \nthe script , written by ramis along with peter tolan and ken lonergan , starts off funny , remains funny for the most of the film , but sadly peters out somewhat during the last twenty minutes where it wrongly enters more serious territory . \nthe film is short , however , and just before audience interest is waning the film suddenly goes into a rather rushed and unsatisfying ending and the credits roll . \nanalyze this is a good comedy , and is certainly worth watching . \nrobert de niro sobbing is reason enough to watch it , even though it does seem forced , or like a parody ( although i think this was intentional . ) \ncrystal is his most likeable in years , kudrow is given as little screen time as possible , which is a good thing , and de niro is just awesome . \nit's no goodfellas , and it probably won't be remembered as much as groundhog day , but analyze this is a well done comedy that won't leave you feel cheated . \n", " \" being john malkovich \" is the type of film we need to see more . \ntoday's films are either blockbusters that entertain us with tiresome formulas , or those that have similar themes . \nmalkovich falls under none of these categories , and it's quite refreshing to see that occur . \nthis strangely provoking story , is actually somewhat understandable . \njohn cusack plays a puppeteer trying to make it to the big time . \nhis wife ( cameron diaz ) supports the both of them by working at a petstore , which explains the obscure pets they keep in their apartment . \nwhen cusack finally realizes he needs to get a job , he finds an ad for a filing clerk . \nwhen he

partner ( catherine keener ) , in which he falls madly in love with her . \nthe only problem is , she has no interest in him what so ever . \nthe whole portal thing , isn't just a toy , in fact , it becomes cusack's dream . \nbeing inside malkovich's mind , gave him the opportunity to basically control mlakovich , like a puppet , and to fulfill his fantasies . \ni don't want to give away too much , but cusack becomes too attached with his discovery . \nin my opinion , this idea is absolutely brilliant . \nit's really quite scary to think that someone could become you , control you , be you . \nit makes you wonder why we act like we do , and why sometimes we blurt out things or act out something out of the blue . \neven if the script is super sharp , i can't help but find the ending displeasing . \nit could have lead up to something more , or at least an amusing conclusion . \nit tried to explain a mythology about the portals , that made it seem rushed . \nother than that , i had a very enjoyable time . \nthe acting was quite delightful as well . \njohn cusack has finally been given a chance to prove his ability , and he does it well . \nhe's by far the most underrated actor due to a lack of popularity , but i'm hoping that will change . \ncameron diaz was her usual charming self , although i felt that part was wrong for her , but she pulled it off . \njohn malkovich himself continues to creep out people with his eerie facial expressions and tone of voice . \nwho else's mind would be better to explore ? \nthe director , spike jonze , who appeared in last month's three kings really catches my attention with this project . \ni knew he was bizzare , but not to this extreme . \nhe too is likely too receive media attention . \n \" being john malkovich \" isn't an excellent film , but it is definitly entertaining and will eaisly become a cult favorite . \nwhat's even better is the film's puzzling message . . . am \ni nick lyons ? \n", "as feel-good formulaic as it may be in its own way , shall we dance ? \nalso demonstrates a kind of charming restraint you don't often find in american films . \nthis japanese import tells the story of a middle-aged accountant

demeanor ( and slightly infatuated with her ) , sugiyama signs up for weekly classes at the school -- and , much to his amazement , ends up as attracted to dancing itself as to his young sensei . \nmeanwhile , sugiyama's wife ( hideko hara ) becomes suspicious of his late wednesday nights , and sets a private detective on her husband's trail . \nin a hollywood film , you can bet that sub-plot would be turned into a stream of slapstick comedy and crazy misunderstandings . \nin shall we dance ? , writer/director masayuki suo dispenses with it in a matter of minutes , using it to set up later character interactions rather than letting it overwhelm the story with pratfalls . \nneither does he make the climactic moment of victory a competition between the hero and some mean-spirited token rival . \nsuo gives his comedy the graceful movements of his subject matter , allowing the humor to flow from the characters rather than forcing it upon them . \nan opening prologue in shall we dance ? \ngoes to some effort to place the film in a sociological perspective , explaining how contrary ballroom dancing is to the japanese sense of propriety . \nit's a forced message in a story which doesn't need such a culture-specific angle . \nthe dance school in shall we dance ? \nplays the role of a singles' mixer , with everyone vaguely embarrassed to be there yet taking the opportunity to try on new personalities . \nmost amusing among these new personalities is the one adopted by sugiyama's co-worker mr . aoki ( naoto takenaka ) , a balding systems analyst who becomes a fiery latin lover when he dons a frizzy wig and begins to rumba . \nsugiyama's awakening is less overt , but koji yakusho does a wonderful job showing a transformation of small steps . \nit's a delicate performance with a huge heart . \nshall we dance ? \nis a fairly lightweight experience , which makes its final half hour rather a long sit . \nsuo crams a lot of exposition into very little time , including an unnecessarily detailed back-story for mai , resulting in a sluggish march towards the resolution . \nit is here that shall we dance ? \nfeels most hollywood-conventional , attempting to blind-side the audience with a truckload of emotional catharsis . \nsuo might have been better advised to conclude with the small gem of a scene in which sugiyama and his wife take their first tentative dance steps together . \nthat's the real joy of dance shall we dance ? \nconveys : its ability to create an intoxicating mood of romance which can soften the stiffest shirt . \n", " \" the tailor of panama \" is a different kind of spy movie . \ndespite the presence of pierce brosnan , there is nary a hint of james bond flash here . \ninstead of big action scenes , leering super villains and empty-headed femme fatales , we get interesting characters and an intriguing situation . \nbased on the novel by john le carr ? , who also co-wrote the screenplay , the film offers viewers something rarely seen in theaters this time of year : a solid , well-told story . \nbrosnan plays andy osnard , a british operative walking on thin ice . \nhis british superiors ship him off to panama , making sure he understands that he had better not screw up the placement . \nosnard arrives in the tropics virtually oozing contempt for his new co-workers and his new home base . \nwhen shown the bridge of the americas by a person marveling over the fact that , since the creation of the panama canal , the structure is the sole connection between north and south america , he barely keeps from yawning . \nbrosnan clearly relishes the chance to be the antithesis of 007 , investing the suave spy with a distinct reptilian quality coupled with an air of indifference that irks his fellows to no end . \nsearching for a way to get information on the government , osnard sets his sights on harry pendel ( geoffrey rush ) , an unctuous tailor serving the panamanian elite . \nharry claims to be a transplant from britain's renowned saville row , but osnard knows his secret : the tailor is an ex-con who served five years in prison after torching his uncle's shop in an insurance scam . \nhe also knows that harry is up to his ears in debt , having spent a fortune on an unsuccessful farm . \nosnard offers harry a way out . \nhe will pay for information harry has gathered from his upscale clientele . \neager to comply , harry offers what he knows , then starts concocting tidbits to keep the money flowing . \nbefore long , he is forced to spy on his loving wife , louisa ( jamie lee curtis ) , an aide to the canal director . \nharry's little lies build , eventually taking on a life of their own . \nosnard turns in reports about the \" silent opposition , \" a group threatening to upset the balance of control over the canal . \nthe bogus revelation proves explosive , leading to meetings in washington d . c . over how to best protect the vital waterway . \nmeanwhile , osnard wallows in his newfound status , enjoying the best the city has to offer and wooing an attractive co-worker . \nand harry grows ever more fretful , fearing the consequences if his clients , not to mention his wife , learn about his lies . \ngeoffrey rush is wonderful as harry , fawning over his customers by day and savoring his rich family life in the evenings , all while playing secret agent in the off hours with his new benefactor . \nrush makes harry a credible figure , presenting the various levels of the character so effectively that he remains sympathetic despite his duplicity . \nafter gaining fame playing larger than life characters , rush flips everything around for this role , using his energy to depict the quiet desperation of a man slowly realizing that the solution to his troubles may be worse than the original problems . \nalthough she gets far too little screen time , jamie lee curtis imbues louisa with a depth greater than the screenplay provides her . \nof the central characters , she is the only one that exhibits maturity and genuine self-confidence . \ncurtis is one of my favorite female actors ; whiplash smart , sultry and charismatic , she deserves more than supporting roles . \nspeaking of supporting characters , there are some great ones here . \nharold pinter is amusing as harry's uncle benny , who pops up throughout the story in a number of creative ways . \nalso shoring up the proceedings is jon polito as a corrupt banker and dylan baker , who is a riot as a united states general straight out of the dr . strangelove school of armed patriotism . \nbut the most important secondary performers are leonor varela and brendan gleeson , both outstanding as two wounded activists . \ntheir presence adds weight to the story , reminding us that beyond the charades of the leading men , there are real people that have suffered greatly over the politics connected to the canal . \ndirector john boorman adds additional verisimilitude by shooting the film on location . \ninstead of using panama city merely as a colorful backdrop , he adroitly weaves in footage of all aspects of life there . \nthe metropolis , described by one character as \" casablanca without heroes \" pulsates with life , underling the folly of the two foreigners playing dangerous games that could have a disastrous impact on a great many people . \n \" the tailor of panama \" succeeds because the principals behind it were bright enough to make it more than a simple entertainment . \n", "perhaps it's time for me to say a little about my reading habits . \ni really do like to read , and i've enjoyed many books in my lifetime . \nmy problem is that i'm a slow reader , and not very dedicated -- i'll enjoy portions of a book and then set it down for months at a time ( it's taken me the last six weeks to get through the first one hundred pages of anna karenina , even though i'm loving the book ) . \nin addition to this , i typically don't read anything created after the 19th century . \nthe only reason i bother with this bit of information is because i feel bad admitting , time after time , that i haven't read any of the books on which these films are based ( the only exception , i believe , is great expectations ) . \nhowever , i don't think it should be necessary to read the book beforehand in order to judge the quality of the film . \nneedless to say , i haven't read the elmore leonard novel out of sight , on which steven soderbergh's new film is based . \ni can't say how faithful of an adaptation it is , or if it lives up to leonard's vision . \ni can say that it's a terrific film , with sharp acting , great dialogue , and pumping full of energy and style injected by soderbergh . \nit's certainly a nice distraction from 1998's lineup of brainless blockbusters , all hopelessly wishing that size mattered . \nout of sight proves that it doesn't . \ni had originally written george clooney off as a one-note actor , incapable of depth but occasionally showing a little flair . \nafter seeing his latest performance in this film , i've changed my mind -- this guy can act , but he also has that forceful presence that most certainly will make him one of those $20 million superstars . \nhere , he plays jack foley , a middle aged guy who robs banks for a living . \nhe does it because it's fun , i think , but the film opens with him getting caught because his car won't start . \nhe goes to jail -- which is interesting -- only to break out five cinematic minutes later with the help of his friend , buddy ( ving rhames ) . \nwe're then introduced to karen sisco ( jennifer lopez ) , a u . s . marshall who , conveniently , is waiting with a shotgun as jack escapes . \nfortunately , they take her hostage , and she and jack spend some quality time in the trunk together as buddy drives them to safety . \nthe central conflict arises when both jack and karen become obsessed with one another , though their respective jobs make them superficially incompatible . \nwe soon learn that the film is not told in sequence ( and , since this is a gritty crime comedy , flashbacks of pulp fiction should arise ) . \nat first , i kind of felt that it was a gimmick , but i guess it was a gimmick in pulp fiction , too . \nit's a fun gimmick , though , and soderbergh treats the material with enough humor that everything comes off naturally . \ni've only seen a few of soderbergh's films ( i was impressed both with kafka and sex , lies , and videotape ) , but i think he's excellent at what he does . \nhe's an artist without making it obvious , and without being pretentious , which is always admirable . \nhe uses tricks , yes ( lots of freeze-frame stuff here ) , but it all adds to the smooth and quirky currents in the film . \nas i said , clooney is terrific , and he's matched by lopez . \nlopez is , of course , beautiful , but she can act , too . \ni can sense that she's honing in on her skills , for she comes off more natural here than she has in any of her previous ventures ( not that stone gave her much help in the loathsome u-turn ) . \nthe two actors have arresting chemistry with one another -- the best scene in the film , by far , is the seduction scene . \nthe brilliance of this scene is also due , in part , to soderbergh , for he cuts back and forth from their quiet discussion in a bar to the physical act which takes place a few minutes later . \nthe scene is a series of soft nuances and glances , layered upon light dialogue , and the result is one of the better love scenes in recent cinema -- meaningful and engrossing . \nthe supporting cast is strong , led by the always-reliable ving rhames . \ndennis farina , who plays karen's father , is good , as is don cheadle as the profoundly stupid villain . \nsteve zahn , who plays jack's nearly-brain dead accomplice glenn , steals all of his scenes ( and that's in a film where every scene is already at a high level ) . \nall of the actors are helped by the dialogue and the intelligently-constructed script by scott frank . \nout of sight is certainly a light film , although there are a few heavy moments that will linger in the memory . \noverall , i can recommend it simply as great entertainment . \nnot every film has to change your life , and it's nice to see a movie that uses the art to tell a great story and simply to entertain its viewers . \nas for the book , this film is good enough to make me believe that there might be something in the text worth looking at . \n", "note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \namong my fanatical ticker tape-worshipping friends , there's one who happens to share the same philosophy espoused by the central character in darren aronofsky's darkly original pi : the entire stock market can be reduced to nothing but a series of patterns which , through analysis , will produce information to accurately forecast future behaviour . \n ( an example of the mentality involved : if the stock price goes up like this , and then down like that , and then sharply up this way , it then will go * this * way . ) \nwhile i freely admit that i know less than nothing about the market ( knowledge check : prices up -- good ; prices down -- bad ; most of the time , at least ) and hence really couldn't comment with any authority , it's always nonetheless struck me as an incredibly naive oversimplification of an astonishingly complex system ( and besides , if it were that simple , no doubt somebody would've already figured it all out ) . \nthe difference in this case is that while my colleague ( an otherwise assuredly realistic individual ) truly believes in this in and of itself as a valid forecaster , pi uses this ideology as a device with which to investigate its character's psychosis . \nit's also vastly more convincing with its argument . \n \" mathematics is the language of the universe , \" insists genius protagonist maximillian cohen ( sean gullette ) in a cool , mantra-like voice-over which repeats throughout the picture . \nsince nature can be expressed in numbers , and there are patterns everywhere in nature , he reasons with eminent logic that finding the patterns will allow him to predict anything -- the ups and downs of the stock market , how many games the yankees will win this year , the flavour of jam i'm going to put on my toast tomorrow morning . \nobsessed with finding the proverbial key to the universe , max lives in paranoid , self-imposed solitude in a seedy nyc chinatown apartment , single-mindedly toiling away with his monstrous homemade computer system . \nsullenly withdrawn and plauged by debilitating migraines , the elusive pursuit of a mysterious 216-digit number his machine spits out one day is driving him into madness . \nthe story , then , is basically an eccentricity , but it's a clever , astute eccentricity , perceptively zeroing in on the modern mistrust of mathematical reductionism ; in an age where a dominant societal phobia is one's individualism being replaced by a series of numeric identifiers , max's all-consuming penchent for numbers at once creates a lingering , unsettling mood . \nit helps matters that he's not a particularly likable protagonist . \nall attempts of friendliness from neighbours are curtly rebuffed by max , a spindly , neurotic-looking individual who hasn't the time to indulge in pleasantries . \nfor a film which puts its lead character front and center ( mr . gullette appears in virtually every scene ) , pi takes a refreshing and effective approach in avoiding conventional aesthetics ; because of our ambivalence with max , we're not so much avidly rooting for him to triumph with a moment of epiphany as we're following him through this plot with a sense of mixed dread and morbid fascination -- it's more disturbing journey than quest . \nstill , we do care about max's fate . \nteetering on the edge of dementia , he winds up being pursued by two different groups which want to pick his brain , both fronted by deliciously perky , resolutely cheerful representatives with inevitably duplictious intentions . \nas we know , in films where paranoia is a dominant element ( see the truman show's laura linney character ) , or for that matter , in real life , it's always the ones who never stop smiling at you and are overly friendly that are the ones of which to be wary . \npi , a film that addresses patterns , itself intentionally adheres to an identifiable pattern cycle -- headache scene ; important revelation or bit of plot development ; pill-popping montage ; hallucinatory nightmare ( with decidedly cronenberg-esque undertones -- few other directors are as equally adept in bridging unsettling concepts and body-themed horror ) ; nosebleeding reality . \nthe repetitiveness , far from being tedious , is effectively maddening ; more than anything , the picture aims to get under our skins and take in events from max's claustrophobic perspective . \nin this regard , it wildly succeeds due to mr . aronofsky's striking direction . \nit's a rarity that a film so completely immerses itself into a protagonist's warped perspective of his surrounding , and high contrast black-and-white cinematography combined with constant usage of extreme close-ups lend a heightened sense of paranoia to the proceedings . \n ( in some scenes , the stark composition in conjunction with the lumbering approach by mr . gullette make his character curiously resemble a latter-day max schreck , from nosferatu . ) \nusing savage , jittery lensing and rapid cuts to create a sense of disorientation , the picture is often dizzying to behold , and max's effective isolationism is emphasized by shots from the so-called snorri cam , which keep him in plain focus while the environment races by in blurred bursts . \npi's raw , aggressive visuals are reminiscent of david lynch's early work ( in particular , eraserhead ) . \nthe film's sinister tone splashes onto the screen immediately with a dazzling opening credit sequence ably backed by a sly electronic score by clint mansell , and gradually increases in intensity . \nstill , amidst all its kafkaesque qualities and overall dispassionate mood , pi does occasionally display a sense of humour . \nat one point , marcy dawson ( pamela hart , great fun ) entices max with the offer of an invaluable treasure : a one-of-a-kind . . . \ncomputer chip . \n \" isn't it beautiful , \" she coos . \na showcase for mr . aronofsky's technical virtuosity ( made for $60 000 , it's since gone on to capture acclaim at the 1998 sundance film festival ) , pi is an intriguingly cerebral story which , ironically , is perhaps the most purely visceral film of the year . \n", "upon arriving at the theater during the opening credits , i took my seat and prepared myself for what appeared to be \" hellraiser meets the crow \" . \nbut as soon as kiefer sutherland began speaking the narrative monologue , describing \" the strangers \" and their reasons for contacting human beings , i was hooked . \nthere was something especially compelling about the nature of his voice . \ni knew from the start that i was going to witness the actions of his character rather than the actor attempting the character . \nsutherland played the role as a true veteran . \nupon the completion of his monologue , the camera arrives on sutherland in such a fashion that you can only wonder how long alex proyas spent on cinematography . \ni would imagine , for a film of this caliber , that maximum hours of work were spent where they were needed the most . \nthe film flowed beautifully . \nas i was being taken through the intricate regions of the \" dark city \" , a clever plot began to unravel , to the point where the last time i had seen such clever plot twists were in \" the usual suspects \" . \nnot to mention a series of special effects that would make james cameron literally turn green with envy . \nbut if you're not exactly the biggest sci-fi fan , caveat emptor . \nget ready for the atmostpheric darkness of \" 12 monkeys \" or \" the crow \" without the boredom or depression . \nthe concept of the plot is as mindstretching as \" 12 monkeys \" was , however , so be prepared and be sophisticated . \nand imagine a picture that finally does justice to the comic-book-gone-feature-film fad that hollywood has recently become abusive of . \ndark city simply puts \" spawn \" to shame . \nin fact , during the climax of the film i couldn't help but feel the strong presence of an \" akira \" -esque explosion throughout the general feeling of the movie . \nso my initial predictions were wrong . \nthis film is anything but the meloncholy of \" hellraiser \" parts one through five . \ni'm never one to base a film entirly on special effects , so know that when i give dark city \nit's actually because the film contained all of the neccessary ingredients to keep me entertained and awake from storyline to plot twists to camerawork to even ( tsk , tsk ) special effects . \nnot since contact have i recieved such deep insight into the way the human mind operates and never this year have i been so blown away . \nthe best film i've seen all year , and easily one of the best i've ever seen \n", "kadosh means sacred in hebrew . \namos gitai's fictional work , after spending most of his career doing documentaries , is a grim story about a failed hasidic marriage , even though the marriage is a loving one . \nthe marriage will symbolize the clash of cultures in modern israel between the native israeli's modern viewpoint toward religion and the political savvy hasidic's intolerable one , as both groups are vying for control of the secular government . \ngitai ( devarim/yom yom ) is a labor party leftist , who believes that if the rigid hasidic ever got control of the government , it would sound the death knell of israel . \nthe emphasis of the film is on how the ultra-orthodox jews of that sect live by the letter of the torah in everything they do and how they subjugate the women to accept their vision of god's law from only the male's view . \nthat if they ever got control of the country , their intolerant attitude would subjugate the country the same way the women are . \nthe story takes place in jerusalem's jewish quarters called mea shearim , where we are taken down sinewy back streets with placards pasted on the walls , and into the crowded apartments and prayer rooms where the protagonists live out their idea of the proper jewish life , which is much different than the way most jews live in israel . \nthis is a controversial film , in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes are to such an extreme patriarchal ones , that the film is bound to anger most viewers , no matter their belief . \nit is a slow-moving , meticulous film , that grabs hold of you by the collar and never lets go . \nthe force of what is seen , though filmed in an objective manner , never taking a cheap shot at the hasidim , is nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such a practice of strict observance . \nthe film is meant to be critical of such a rigid people , as it implies how they kill the spirit of everything they touch and with their extreme phobic attitudes , it makes it impossible for them to unite the country when they can't at present live in harmony with their own people , and it would be even more impossible to imagine them living with their arab neighbors in peace . \nthe film opens as meir rises at dawn and goes through his prayer ritual , where every prayer is made to the virtues of god . \nhe even thanks god that he didn't make him a woman . \nhis wife rivka accepts the fate she was born into and looks at him from the next bed where she sleeps separately according to hasidic custom . \nshe looks at him with glistening eyes , not questioning the laws or rebelling against her secondary role and how her religion keeps her from studying the talmud and having all the modern conveniences of life , and from seeing movies and tv . \nmeir is a talmudic scholar . \nhis father ( abu warda ) is a rabbi at the yeshiva . \nhe has been married for ten years and his wife has not been able to give him a child . \nsince the hasidim look upon a woman's role in life being only to conceive children , and cook and clean house for the man , while the man's role is to spend his time in prayer , therefore there is an insurmountable problem in this otherwise loving marriage . \nshe receives an anonymous letter that states \" a woman without a child is no better than dead . \" \nmeir's response , is that it is written like that in the talmud . \nmeir's father tells him that the marriage contract must be broken : \" a man who dies without progeny rips a page from the torah . \" \nall the blame is placed on rivka , who is thought of as unpure as the reason for her being barren . \nshe will go through countless ritual baths to cleanse herself , as her rigid mother ( koenig ) dunks her in the holy water and says a ritual prayer for the 12 times she is dunked as an homage to the 12 tribes of israel . \ntheir religion doesn't permit them to be examined extensively by a doctor . \nrivka goes on the sly and finds out that it is her husband who is sterile , but she cannot tell him that because of their religion . \nso when meir's father chooses a younger woman for his son , she is exiled to live alone in a cold apartment in the same jewish quarters . \nrivka's spirited younger sister malka does not want to get married but wants to live a more liberated life . \nshe has a long time romantic relationship with a fellow hasidic yaakov . \nbut , because of the way they were both raised , she is still a virgin . \nwhen yaakov joined the israeli army to fight in lebanon , something his sect is not allowed to do , he is thereby banished from the sect even though he is still a believer . \nhe now works as a singer in a nightclub . \nmalka's mother is worried that her daughter won't get married , so she arranges with the rabbi for her to marry yossef , someone whom she doesn't love . \nyossef is a very stern follower of the order , he is also a political activist who drives around the city in a sound-truck with a bull-horn urging jews to stick together and fight their godless enemies . \nthe two sisters are close and languidly discuss their options , with rivka telling her sister to accept the marriage , it will make her happy ; but , while malka is reluctantly forced into accepting it , she has other plans to ruin this bogus marriage . \nthe harshest scene in the film is on malka's wedding night . \nyossef prays to god for a child and then robotically gets malka to spread her legs , and without the least bit of affection , only a nervousness shown on his part for the function he supplies , as he goes inside her and rams her hard , thrusting away until the act is completed and then retiring without a word or gesture of love . \nthe sisters have choices , like everyone else in life does . \nbut the choices are obliterated by one's beliefs , circumstances , and inward nature , and how difficult it is to carry out those choices if it goes completely against the way one is brought up . \nfor the sisters , the choices are life or death ones . \ngitai by closing in on the daily rituals , tight living quarters and close-knit community , has shown how difficult these choices are for those who have never seen another world and have been kept in the dark all their life . \nthe film ends with the forlorn malka walking atop of jerusalem and looking down upon it as an outsider would , and everything seems strange to her , all the things she once thought of as being set in stone are now harsh memories , as she has made her choice , and the price of that choice is very heavy indeed . \n", "the film \" magnolia \" can be compared to a simple flower as its title and movie poster suggests . \nthe dozens of characters introduced and developed are like the petals on the flower . \nthey all come from the same stem and as the flower begins to develop they grow farther and farther apart . \nthe numerous characters in the film are all closely connected no matter how different they are from one another socially . \nfrom a humiliated but kind cop to an aging game show host , each one of these characters is suffering the same kind of pain . \nthey are each seriously lonely and seek the perfect companion to end this loneliness . \nwhether this companion is a distant family member or a spouse , each character begs for one and spends the whole film searching for the perfect one . \n \" magnolia \" is a clever , well thought out film from prodigy director-writer paul thomas anderson of \" boogie nights \" fame . \nthe detailed character analyses and the powerful script make \" magnolia \" memorable . \nhowever , what really is impressive is that even though there are tons of characters in several unrelated stories , the film is never confusing . \nanderson's control over transitioning from one story to another story is masterful . \nhe also knows exactly when to cut to another subplot since not one of \" magnolia's \" scenes drag on too long . \nany three hour film that does not deliver even one uninteresting scene is definitely worth recommending . \nfrom the fascinating beginning to the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just doesn't get boring . \nit is obvious that anderson put a lot of time into connecting each subplot . \nthis is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation . \nevery character is connected to every other character by at the most two degrees . \nfor example , cop john c . reilly is connected to game show host phillip baker hall through hall's daughter melora walters who once went on a date with reilly . \nthe fact that each character is so different from the others yet so similar shows that there are universal pains that all classes , races , and genders suffer . \nanderson's explanation to prove this point is both accurate and convincing . \nthe only mistake anderson made in trying to connect his characters was by making his actors all sing an aimee mann song simultaneously . \nthis was foolish not only because it was unbelievable and hilariously erroneous but also because it had a broadway musical feel to it and this movie is about as far apart from your typical broadway musical than you can get . \nthe performances in \" magnolia \" are perfection . \nthis is a classic example of flawless casting and flawless ensemble acting . \nanderson allows many of hollywood's best supporting actors to blossom at what they do best , character acting . \nall of the main characters in each story are perfect because they are able to reveal more emotions and attitudes in their brief time on the screen then most movie stars can do in a feature length film . \nworth noting is tom cruise , who stepped out of his usual superficial starring role and into a funny but depressing tour de force performance . \nhe was probably noticed more than the other actors in the film by award givers because his role here is so much different and impressive than those in the past ( however any actor in this film could be nominated for best supporting actor without any complaints ) the only problem i had with the acting was that a few of the characters felt seriously edited down such as melinda dillon's character as phillip baker hall's wife . \nshe seemed to be thrown in towards the end and i felt very little sympathy for her because i had not seen her enough earlier in the film . \n \" magnolia \" uses several effective metaphors to describe its characters . \nanderson has the talent to make the audience sympathetic towards numerous people in only a few hours . \nto see that anderson is able to perfectly portray this many different types of people shows that he has a keen sense of diversity . \ndiversity is what makes a director successful for a long period of time . \ni predict a lot of diversity and success from anderson in the future . \n", "no humans were harmed , tested or tasted in the making of this film . \nall recipes are fictions . \ntwentieth century fox does not condone cannibalism . \na psychological thriller that will scare you to the depth of your soul ! \ndirector/writer antonia bird shows us that the most terrifying horror is not provided by giant beasts , but instead by monsters lurking in ourselves . . \n \" . . they were a party of settlers in covered wagon times and they had to resent to cannibalism in order to stay alive . . \" \nthis true story , briefly mentioned in \" the shining \" , has no turned into a 143 minutes long motion picture . \nin 1847 , the united states was a land of pioneers , of gold-starved americans making their way west . \nit was a period of manifest destiny , the inevitability of the country extending its boundaries , stretching out its arms and consuming all the land it could . \ncapt . john boyd ( guy pearce ) has become both a \" hero \" and a victim during this period of relentless consumption . . . \nin ways he could never have imagined . \nboyd's journey to hell begins when he is awarded for an act of cowardice during a horrific mexican-american war battle earns him banishment to a desolate military outpost , a waystation for western travelers in the barren and icy sierra nevada mountains in california . \nupon his arrival he is greeted by a small , motley group of soldiers , including his commanding officer , hart ( jeffrey jones ) , a previously intelligent and sophisticated man who has lost his aristocratic origin in the heat of battle and has pretty much given up on life ; toffler ( jeremy davies ) , the fort's personal emissary to the lord ; knox ( stephen spinella ) , the veterinarian that plays doctor , who never met a bottle of whiskey he didn't like ; reich ( neal mcdonough ) , the no-nonsense soldier of the group ; and the seriously \" over-medicated \" cleaves ( david arquette ) , a cook whose meals are inspired more by peyote than culinary ambitions . \ninto this cold , bleak and bizarre world staggers a stranger , colqhoun ( robert carlyle ) , a half-starved scot who had been traveling with a group of settlers until they became snowbound . \nseeking refuge in a cave , they soon ran out of food - and were forced to consume one another . \ncolqhoun barely escaped becoming an hors d'oeuvre himself . \nour heroes then decide to journey through the mountains to find the survivors , and colqhoun tags along to help out . \nsoon it becomes clear that colqhoun's tale has ramifications beyond cannibalism and the will to survive . \nit involves an old indian myth called weendigo , which states that a man who eats the flesh of another steals that person's strength , spirit and very essence . \nhis hunger becomes an insatiable craving : the more he eats , the more he wants , and the stronger he becomes . \nthere can never be enough , and death is the only escape . . \nit's all fairly sickening and you have to have a healthy stomach to see the whole movie through . \nas professionally made as the movie is , you have to wonder who they thought would come piling into the theater to see this . \nteen-age horror fans won't care because none of the soldiers look remotely like neve campell . \nolder folks might show up when they hear that the movie is actually a satire about the pioneer spirit , but they'll be disappointed once all the raw meat starts getting waved in their faces . \nbut jokes aside , this is a film that is well worth watching . \nit has wonderful and mature characters , that few horror film s can boast of and a strangely effective story that continues to electrify you till the end . \nthe two main characters are also the most interesting . \nboyd is a simple , honest man tiered of war , killing and fear . \nhis sacred wish is to live a normal , quite life away from gunpowder and blood . \ncolqhoun is different . \nhe proves that a man , on the brink of death , would do anything to stay alive , including sacrificing his own soul . \nhe believes so much in this indian myth that he starts to change physically . \nit is the power of the human mind and conviction that make miracles happen . \nthe atmosphere in \" ravenous \" is macabre and bizarre , scary and surreal . \ncompletely isolated from the rest of the world , stands fort spencer . \nhere time stands still , and nothing changes . \nthe inhabitants are soldiers driven by war and pillage . \nthey are all somehow losers of society that have been banished -- men that are used to killing and have not done anything else in their entire life . \nmen that are nothing , and has nothing to loose . \nthe result is some sort of cabin fever . \ncannibalism is more like a sick game for them . \nsince they find no pleasure in living , they find some excitement in killing and dying . \nit's like \" who's going to die first ? \" \nthe unchangeable icy landscape , where birds do not sing and even wind doesn't move the leaves on the trees , resembles kubrick's \" the shining \" . \nit's hard to not get mad here ! \none of the scary aspects of the film is a strange connection that the viewer establishes with the characters , and starts to understand them , although they have turned into half crazed killers . \nmusic is another factor that strengthens the atmosphere . \na strange musical score , composed by michael nyman ( the piano ) and damon albarn , that often seems out of place , and in complete contrast to the image , somehow reflects the characters' twisted reactions on the world and their situation . \nthe director herself stated that it was \" ok to laugh \" during the picture . \nand i must admit that it is often very funny , in a strange way ( such as the wonderful quote : \" . . it's \nlonely being a cannibal . \nyou don't get that many friends . . . \" \nor when colqhoun is quoting ben franklin , saying \" eat to live . \ndon't live to eat . \" ) . but \nmostly it is frightening and shocking as it goes deeper into the minds of these strange men and we witness their psychological change . \nevery actor does a great job . \nespecially robert carlyle as the sinister and intelligent cannibal , and guy pearce as the moral and honest soldier , nagged by his undeserved honor . \nthis strange couple resemble lestat and lois in neil jordan's 'interview with the vampire' . \nactually there are many amusing parallels and connections to vampire movies , since the topics are so alike . \n \" ravenous \" starts wonderfully and continues to shock and scare until it gets to the finale , where it looses focus and gets too primitive and rather boring . \nhowever these little failures don't diminish the impression . \nthis is a bizarre dark comedy about the human mind and its change in different situations . \nit is a scary fable about the monster that lurks in everyone's soul , a dark side which we're all trying to hide -- but it's there -- always . \nit is one of the most frightening and successful horror films since \" the shining \" . \n \" . . i said no food . \ni didn't say there was nothing to eat . . . \" \n- colqhoun , ravenous \n", " \" good will hunting \" is two movies in one : an independent take on the struggle of four boston pals and a traditional hollywood , \" prodigy child \" film complete with upbeats , downfalls , sporadically moving situations and plenty , plenty of shtick . \nunusually directed by gus van sant , \" good will hunting \" overcomes the banalities of its story by affirming the emergence of fresh , new talent . \nthe film stars matt damon as will hunting as a mathematical , rebellious whiz kid inadvertly discovered by a college professor ( stellan skarsgard ) , who places him under psychological supervision with robin williams . \nin a nutshell , that's it . \nthe core of the \" good will hunting \" is damon , who infuses the script ( co- written by \" chasing amy's \" ben affleck ) with just the right amount of warmth , sensitivity and humanity to accentuate his position as a refreshing multi- talented performer . \nbut it's the acting that hits the mark , and damon hits all the right notes , flying over robin williams' deja-vu role ( \" awakenings \" was written all over this ) as a devastated shrink who has closed all contact with society due to his wife's tragic death . \ndamon effortlessly blends the carelesness of a gregarious , confused thug with the absorbing ingeniousness of someone like einstein . \nhis rich , complex character is the pulp of \" good will hunting . \" \neverything else pales in comparison . \n \" good will hunting \" exposes the lack of profoundness of deliberately schmaltzy storytelling , but , unlike \" little man tate \" or \" phenomenon \" , it doesn't set up its story in a black and white , point a to point b be manner , but as the saga of an extraordinary individual whose feasibility for success doesn't automatically signify he must make easy , familiar choices , like the protagonists in the aforementioned . \n", "curdled is a deliciously dark and witty black comedy , but its humour won't appeal to everyone . \nto be specific , let me give you an example . \ndo you know in pulp fiction where jules and vincent go on brain detail after marvin and his head accidentally get separated ? \nif you thought that was completely tasteless and unfunny , don't see curdled . \non the other hand , if you found that sequence to be pretty funny , you have the sense of humour that curdled is aimed at . \nour film's heroine , gabriela , played by angela jones , is a woman obssessively curious about murder and serial killers ; she even keeps a scrapbook of news articles . \nluckily for her , miami is being plagued by a serial killer rampage - her scrapbook is getting pretty big . \nthe killer's nickname in the press is the blue blood killer , because he preys on older rich socialite women , and he's played by william baldwin ( this is not a spoiler ) . \none particularly striking m . o . \non the blue blood killer is his propensity to decapitate his victims . \ngabriela is watching television one day when she spots an advertisement for a firm whose line of work is perfectly attuned to her interests . \nshe immediately quits her job , and signs on with pfcs , which stands for post-forensic cleaning service . \nno points for guessing what they do . \nher workmates are confused by gabriela's fascination with murder ; to them , it's just a day job . \nthere's a hilarious locker room scene where they debate whether decapitated heads can talk , and what they would say . \ngabriela's partner , elena , played by mel gorham , is particularly perturbed by gabriela's wide-eyed fascination , and becomes really upset when gabriela volunteers them to clean up the blue blood killer's latest scene - they're the messiest , you see . \nunbeknownst to them , the last victim left something on the scene which would id the blue blood killer , so he's also heading over there . . \nthe comparison to pulp fiction earlier on was not accidental - quentin tarantino executive-produced this film , which began life as a short film he saw at a film festival . \napparently tarantino was so impressed that he helped braddock convert this into a feature-length film . \nthere are other parallels - the star of curdled is angela jones ( the top billing goes to william baldwin , but really , jones is the central character ) , who's probably best known for her role as esmerelda villalobos , the death-obssessed taxi driver in pulp fiction . \nthat role was written specifically for jones based upon her similar character in the aforementioned short film , curdled jr . \njones is great in curdled - she's wonderfully funny and maintains an amusing wide-eyed naive curiousity about murder without compromising her character's innocence or likeability . \nshe can express so much with one lift of her eyebrow . \nit's a great performance . \nreb braddock's direction is extremely sharp and clever , toeing the line between black humour and bad taste . \nthe best scene in the film is an outrageously funny sequence involves jones and dancing - any more than that would be a spoiler . \nthe opening credit sequence is also inventive and amusing . \nof course , it's impossible to really take this stuff seriously , but then again you're not really supposed to - braddock knows the audience is in on the joke , and makes it a fun little romp as a result . \nthe one drawback of curdled is that it was based on a short film , and it feels like it ; the material is just stretched too thin in order to fulfill a feature length running time , and some parts just seem to drag . \nwhile its running time is already a short 94 minutes , it could really stand to lose twenty minutes or so to give it better pacing . \ncurdled seems destined to be a nice cult film for miramax . \nit'll be interesting to see if it will appeal to mainstream audiences as well . \n", "it is often said by his fans that hal hartley movies are an acquired taste . \nindeed . \nwhile perhaps less dangerous than tequila shooters or bungee-jumping , they require no less amount of physical stamina and concentration . \ni felt rewarded at the end of henry fool ; this movie creeps up on you-at a slow 139 minutes , i mean creeps-and despite the final shot's ambiguity , i left completely satisfied . \nhenry fool ( \" used to have an ? e' \" ) arrives at garbageman simon grim's house , claims the vacant basement apartment , and almost instantly inspires simon ( urbaniak ) to take up writing-henry ( martin donovan look-alike ryan ) is an ex-convict , a once-great author who has been \" exiled and marginalized \" by the publishing community because of his criminal activity . \nsimon's poetry turns him into a local sensation , as it causes mute women to sing , high-school girls to swoon , and councilmen to rile against its \" pornographic \" content . \nmeanwhile , henry seduces both simon's dependent mother ( porter ) and immature sister ( sundance queen posey ) with philosophical babble ( which is by turns brilliant and inane ) and breathy animal lust . \nthese story elements result in climaxes both inevitable and unpredictable ; the teacher-student relationship formed between henry and simon eventually reverses itself . \nhenry fool is sprinkled with hartley-ian flourishes : simon drinks milk from \" udderley's \" ; the big teen hang-out is called \" world of donuts \" ; simon wears his garbageman's uniform throughout ; the editing style is decidedly elliptical . . . \n ( which is key to the conclusion's said ambiguity ) . \nthe performances by the three leads are abrasive at first , self-consciously \" quirky \" ; the introductory scenes are a chore . \nthese people do grow on you because they convey genuine passion , a belief in themselves , and because they have long-term goals ; henry and simon may drink a lot of budweiser and hang out on the streetcorner , but they aren't pop slackers . \nthe story is rather classical : the tutor is a better talker than a doer , raised on books ; the timid tutee has innate talent his master only dreams of . \n ( shades of film school . . . ) \nthe finished film is epic in its proportions for a story so small , and the final third does test one's patience , yet henry fool is tight , hardly excessive in its length . \nhow refreshing to see a movie this long in 1998 devoted entirely to character . \nand unless i nodded off , not a single building exploded . \nthis , hartley's seventh feature , is contemplative about \" the artist \" ; fortunately , we never get a sampling of simon's work , and it's a testament to the actors and the screenplay that by the end we can surmise what sort of thoughts would pour from these writers' pens . \n", "most people fit into two different categories : you either love woody allen , or you hate his guts . \nmy family , for the most part , hates him and his movies . \ni think he's very funny , but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years . \nso maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of . \nunrestrained by physical boundaries , allen's humor comes shining through . \nthose who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen's intelligent observations of life . \nthose who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one . \nin 1995 , a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they'd never seen before . \ntoy story used state-of-the-art computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present . \nmany critics will call that a better film , but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture . \nantz , however , has upped the ante considerably . \ndisney's a bug's life isn't due out for another two months , and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal . \nby beating disney out , they have satisfied the audience's thirst for computer-animated films . \nbut don't let that fool you : disney is definitely not scared . \nin the past two years , competitions have broken out between studios . \nin 1997 , it was the volcano duel . \nin my opinion , dante's peak came out way ahead of its predecessor , both in time and in quality . \nvolcano had an original premise , but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations . \nin 1998 , there are twice as many competing films . \nfirst was the comet competition , and armageddon blew away it's cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact . \nbut now , it's even more interesting , as one beloved studio ( disney ) goes up against the newcomer ( dreamworks ) . \nwho will prevail ? \ntime will tell , but i'm sure that mr . mouse has nothing to fear . \nthis may sound like i didn't like antz ; on the contrary , i'd put it up there with toy story . \nbut due to it's pg rating , many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldn't appear in disney's version . \nsome of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a family-oriented film . \nsexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally , which makes dreamworks' animated feature geared more for an adult crowd . \nthe humor is also written especially for adults , though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended . \nthis is the type of film that should be made for families more often : entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents . \nantz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allen's shtick and franz kafka's metamorphosis , the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug . \nz ( allen ) is a troubled ant , believing he was not made to be a worker . \n \" when you're the middle child in a family of five million . . . \" he comments about his neglected childhood . \none night , z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver ( sylvester stallone ) , discussing his pathetic place in life . \nin walks princess bala ( sharon stone ) , whom no one recognizes without a crown . \nbala asks z is he would like to dance , and they engage in a pulp fiction-esque dance while everyone else is following the leader . \nafter discovering that she is the princess , z falls in love , but there's a problem : bala is getting married to general mandible ( gene hackman ) , a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony . \nin order to do that , he must eliminate not only the queen ( anne bancroft ) , but the weakest of the colony , namely the worker ants . \nbut to get rid of the queen , he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her . \nhe and colonel cutter ( christopher walkin ) come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle , where they will surely be killed . \nthe queen is reluctant at first , but decides it is best for the colony . \nmeanwhile , z wants to meet bala again , and he asks weaver , an army ant , to switch places with him . \nso z gets sent off to battle , but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites . \nthe battle sequence is absolutely stunning , though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers , which contained a very similar sequence . \nhowever , antz and that 1997 film were both in production around the same time , so the similarities are merely coincidence . \nthe second half of the film revolves around z's kidnapping of bala , and their search for a mythical place called insectopia . \nthere , an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants . \nthe adventures z and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension , especially one involving a magnifying glass . \nlooming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day ( in fact , i'm just going to assume that the producers referenced id4 intentionally ) . \nthe ants look up in awe , and then a beam of fire blasts into the ground . \nvisually , it's an exciting rush of adrenaline . \nbut don't be fooled . . . \nlittle kids shouldn't see this , as they may just try and copy it . \nafter seeing antz , i vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again . \nhopefully , children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel . \nas an animated film , antz is probably the best you will find to date . \nvisually , it's as stunning as what dreams may come . \nthe best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters aren't limited by gravity . \nthey can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible . \none great moment involves a mass of worker ants bunching up to form a wrecking ball . \nthe animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball . \nhowever , the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom of a young boy's shoe . \nit's truly a great example of film making at its finest . \nwith computer technology , the animators have carefully made the ants' faces look similar to the actors providing the voices . \nthe best example would have to be barbatus ( danny glover ) . \nat one point , you can even see the pores on his face ( although , i doubt ants have pores . . . \ndo they ? ) . \nbarbatus also has a touching but rather gruesome scene as he has his final words with z without a body . \nyoung kids may be disturbed by the site of a dismembered head , but a good deal of humor is derived ( more appropriate for adults , of course ) . \ndisney's a bug's life looks good , but i don't know if they will be able to best dreamworks' newest animated feature in terms of animation . \nif not , then dreamworks will have done something no other studio could do : go head to head with the big mouse , and knock him down ( yes , anastasia was good , but not nearly as good as even the worst of disney ) . \nvocal talent is always essential to an animated feature , and antz has one of the best line-ups seen since toy story . \nin fact , it far exceeds that one . \nwoody allen has always been funny , but here he transcends most of what he's done in the past few years . \nwithout a body , his comic timing is the most noticeable thing . \nin fact , i'm pretty sure that the writers let him improvise a lot of his lines . \nsharon stone as bala shows off some of her comic ability , though for the most part , stone works best as a dramatic actress . \nsylvester stallone ( teamed up with stone once again ) is beginning to solidify his statement that he wants to be an actor , not a typecast action star . \nafter a snub at the oscars last year , stallone is proving himself as the serious ( or comedic , as illustrated here ) actor that he is . \ngene hackman is superb as the gruff-talking general , almost doing another take on his crimson tide persona . \nchristopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice , and so many people will remember him from such hits as batman returns . \nanne bancroft has a minimal role , but she's effective nonetheless . \ndanny glover has a small role , but he does a very , very good job . \ndan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick , euro-trash bees--both are very unrecognizable , especially aykroyd . \njennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls in love with weaver , although most people won't recognize her voice either . \nmany people will recognize grant shaud's voice as the foreman . \nhe played miles on the tv show murphy brown . \nthis is definitely a huge cast with some high-profile names , and it will definitely help it's grosses . \nof course , you can probably tell where a lot of the $60 million budget went to , also . \ndirectors eric darnell and lawrence guterman are relative newcomers ( though guterman did direct a 1994 feature , headless ! ) . \nbut both show an incredible talent for this type of a picture . \ntense at times , and very funny throughout , the two hold this film together like professionals . \nthe screenplay by todd alcott and chris weitz is quite simple in plot , but it contains a lot of subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults . \nkids will delight in the animation , while parents can laugh heartily at the humor . \nmost of it will go over young children's heads . \ndoes that mean you shouldn't take kids to see it ? \nnot at all . \nthey will have a lot of fun watching this one . \nwhat is great is the themes that are given to us . \npart social commentary , part romance story , and part moral drama , antz gives everyone something to talk about , whether it be the animation , or the discussions of individualism and community . \nthankfully , it's not subtle in either aspects . \nantz is rated pg for mild language and some intense action . \nsometimes the language can be pushing the limits for a family movie , but the violence is what should keep kids at home . \nthe battle scene has ants melting in acid , and bugs being speared to death . \nand the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in the beam of sunlight . \nbut other than that ( and some sexual innuendos ) , it's a perfect choice for some wholesome fun at the theaters . \ni doubt many children will understand the sexual innuendos unless they are old enough , but it's still advisable to leave really young children at home . \nhave i confused you enough ? \nif you do take your kids , i recommend seeing the film with them , because more than likely , you'll enjoy it the most . \n", "that's the question i asked myself when venturing nervously into \" the wedding singer , \" the latest film to star the saturday night live alumnus . \ndoes he draw laughs from his sad , puppy dog expression and don't-hate-me-for-being-a-simpleton observations ? \nor do fans giggle when he screams at the top of his lungs at people ? \nor is it just the fact that he sings songs with silly lyrics that bowl audiences over ? \nwell , there's a little bit of all of that in \" the wedding singer \" and while i exited the theater still not one hundred percent sure of mr . sandler's thing , i did have a surprisingly good time . \nthat's because , in a nutshell , \" the wedding singer \" is one of the sweetest movies you're ever likely to come across . \nthat's right . \nsweet . \nthe humor in the film runs the gamut from dumb to mildly amusing to laugh-out-loud hysterical but the tone ? \nwell , it's just lovely . \ni have to admit i was half-expecting farting armpit humor , gratuitous nudity , superfluous , cloying subplots , and some nasty , unnecessary violence . \ninstead ? \nwell , i've said it before . \nsweet . \nthe year is 1985 and sandler plays robbie hart , the eponymous wedding singer , a job aspiring rock stars often settle for . \nwhen robbie's fianc ? e dumps him at his own altar , robbie gets depressed and turns to a plucky waitress called julia ( drew barrymore ) who has some problems of her own ( she's marrying a hunky junk bonds dealer who , unbeknownst to her , isn't that big on monogamy ) . \nit isn't giving anything away to say that robbie and julia fall in love . \naww . . . \nsandler and barrymore are a good match and they're assisted by some terrific cameo appearances , including steve buscemi and jon lovitz , whose individual scenes are perhaps the funniest in the film . \nwriter tim herlihy ( with uncredited assistance from carrie fisher ) keeps the story bubbling along to its predictable conclusion . \nit doesn't all work but it's handled with such light-heartedness that robbie and julia coming together generates more smiles than groans . \nherlihy and director frank coraci have done a great job of recreating the sights , sounds , and affectations of the 1980s . \nthe soundtrack--an ever-present force in the film--is packed with wall-to-wall hits of the period , new wave upon new wave of songs from billy idol's \" white wedding \" to the smiths' \" how soon is now ? \" \nto culture club's \" do you really want to hurt me ? \" \nthe mix of music and fashion would make \" the wedding singer \" a great double feature with \" boogie nights . \" \nif you grew up listening to the cure and a flock of seagulls and the psychedelic furs , then \" the wedding singer \" is bound to put a nostalgic hop in your stride . \nif you're a fan of the lovable , laughable adam sandler , well . . . \nlet's just say that \" the wedding singer \" might well be the only film in recent memory to make * me * want to rent \" happy gilmore . \" \n", "jarvis cocker of pulp once said that he wrote common people after noticing mike leigh box-sets on the video shelves -- he had a feeling that economic deprivation was becoming a tourist experience for the well-off . \nmaybe it's a classic case of displacement : it's easier to see jarvis' own lyrics ( obsessed with acrylic and wood chip on the wall ) as a fetishization of lowlife , rather than leigh's films . \nbut it's worth being reminded that drab interiors and a couple of working-class characters don't make for a guarantee of 'authenticity' , let alone a good film . \nit's the triumph of secrets & lies , then , that it goes beyond gestures of sympathy for the common people into a probing of just what it means to seek 'authenticity' and honesty in everyday lives . \nfollowing her adopted mother's funeral , hortense , a young black optometrist , sets out to find her birth mother , and is disturbed to find out that she is white . \nit is cynthia , a factory worker who lives in a shabby house with her perpetually moody daughter roxanne . \ncynthia's younger brother maurice is a successful photographer who has not seen his sister for ages , largely because of his wife's animosity towards her . \nhortense calls up cynthia , who initially breaks down in tears and refuses to see her . \nbut their mutually suspicious meeting gives way to a warm friendship eventually . \ncynthia invites hortense to come along to a party , which maurice is hosting . . . \nsecrets & lies has a simple enough theme at its heart -- as one character puts it , \" best to tell the truth , isn't it ? \nthat way nobody gets hurt . \" . \nbut if the film delivers much more than a trite message , it's because we are also shown how hard it can be to face up to ugly truths , even while the evasions and unspoken grievances slowly choke us . \nhence , cynthia's difficulty with acknowledging ( first to herself , then to others ) that hortense is her daughter . \none of her first reactions to seeing hortense is a sincere denial that she has ever \" been with a black man \" , before a long-suppressed memory seizes her . \nat the party , cynthia's pretense that hortense is her factory co-worker leads her to ever more convoluted lies , as agonizing as they are funny . \nlittle lies seep into every corner , like maurice pretending that he's \" just dropping by \" when he visits cynthia after much deliberation . \nmaurice's job as a photographer gives the film opportunities for side comments on the main theme - a sad-looking bride that maurice coaxes to smile , a couple who pose awkwardly with a prominent wedding ring and argue about his spectacles . \none of the most startling images is of a beautiful woman with large scars on her face : she says she needs the photo to look \" as bad as possible \" to collect insurance money , yet the short scene leaves you wondering about what untold story lies behind the scars . \nthere are occasionally hilarious moments , as when cynthia attempts to give her daughter some unwelcome advice on contraception , \" i've got a dutch cap floating about somewhere upstairs \" ; or when cynthia stares at her own rather pedestrian legs and tells roxanne , \" if you've got it , flaunt it , is what i say . \" \nas played by brenda blethyn , cynthia comes close to being a caricature , with her nervous , somewhat disconnected way of talking . \nbut she's really just right for the role of someone who inspires sympathy and yet strains the tolerance of those around her , precisely because she's so needy of love , perhaps . \nindeed , the whole cast gives warmly rounded , detailed performances . \nthe script was developed partly through improvisations , and the fusion of cast , script and director shows best in the party scene - seemingly everyone is talking at the same time , and yet many subtle observations are being made throughout . \nin a very different way , but also using a long single shot , the scene of hortense and cynthia's first meeting in a lonely caf=8a achieves a touching intensity , all the more for their reticence and unspoken feelings . \nthe film's climax - with all the secrets and lies finally spilled out in ibsen-esque revelations , and everybody hugging each other - is the one thing that seems false about this film . \nhowever , it's a film that truly earns its happy ending after the misery and repression of the character's lives . \nwhen cynthia says near the end , this is the life , innit ? , you get the sense that , following the cynicism of his last film naked , leigh has rediscovered that life can be sweet after all , without comforting illusions . \nthe flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video . \n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \n * * * * * perfection . \nsee it twice . \n", "richard linklater's \" slacker , \" made in 1991 for a budget of only $23 , 000 , immerses itself in the twentysomething , college-town culture of austin , texas . \nmost of these characters are either unemployed or work jobs that are apparently too menial to be worth mentioning . \ntheir lifestyle is a sort of passive resistance to the idea that people should go out and actively pursue a career after graduation ; they seem content to sit around spouting off about the inadequacy of american democracy , the pervasiveness of slave morality , the subtle messages in pop culture , and such . \nask them what they've been doing lately , and they'll more likely than not reply , \" oh , you know , just hanging out . \" \nlinklater uses an interesting technique to examine these characters : the camera follows one person for a few minutes , then someone else walks by and the camera follows that person , who walks into a diner just as another person is walking out the door . \n . \n . \n . \nit's certainly a lot of fun listening to these characters talk : some of them are clearly very intelligent and have some genuinely insightful ideas , some of them are just plain weird , and some of them think their ideas are a lot more profound than they really are . \nthe opening monologue , delivered by linklater himself to a taxi driver , tosses around ideas about alternate realities that nicely set up the meandering structure of the film . \nother characters along the way offer observations about everything from dating relationships to the history of anarchist philosophy , while groups of pseudo-intellectuals kick around ideas about the nobility of sitting around and doing nothing or the subtle bribery-based morality in \" scooby-doo . \" \nfor the most part , however , the best moments are the ones involving the slightly unhinged types . \nnear the beginning , a paranoid man follows a pedestrian for several blocks , warning him about government conspiracies involving everything from global warming to secret colonization of mars . \nanother man seems to be collecting televisions , keeping at least fifteen sets running at the same time and playing tapes of a graduate student who recorded himself having a nervous breakdown and destroying the camera . \nand in a scene that drew a big laugh from everyone present when i saw the film , a man tries to achieve closure after a failed relationship by reciting poetry on a bridge and then throwing a typewriter into the creek below . \nthe only problem with \" slacker \" is that it starts to run out of steam towards the end . \nsince linklater only spends a few minutes with each character , the introduction of the new characters gets repetitive after a while . \nthere are only so many times you can hear , \" hey , what's going on ? \" \n \" not much , what are you up to ? \" \n \" nothing really , just hanging around , \" before it gets on your nerves ; the film might well have benefited from a slightly slower pace and a little bit more characterization . \nand the dialogue in the second half of the film is by and large not quite as interesting as that in the first half ; a jfk buff , for example , seems like a pale imitation of the previous conspiracy theorist , and many of the characters just generally aren't as weird or unique . \ninstead of depicting a city populated by mostly normal people and then showing us the strangeness that we might not have noticed at first , linklater shows us the oddballs first , then stops and reminds us that ordinary people live there too . \n \" slacker \" is a good film and a wonderfully offbeat and entertaining comedy , whatever its flaws , and its status as a cult classic is well-deserved . \ni just can't help but think it might have been even better if linklater had slowed down a little bit and filmed these scenes in reverse order . \n", " \" a breed apart \" casts rutger hauer as a crazy , bird-loving recluse who picks his feathered friends over kathleen turner . \na bit hard to swallow ? \nthat's only the first of many improbabilities in this film . \nhauer stars as a man obsessed with keeping the birds on his island safe , while boothe plays a guy hired to steal a couple of rare eagle eggs by a rich egg collector . \nturner is the woman caught between the two men . \n \" a breed apart \" isn't a bad movie , exactly . \nindeed , i found myself rooting for both the hauer and boothe characters , even though their goals couldn't be more different . \nthe problem with the film is that there are just too many inconsistencies . \nfor example , early on in the film , hauer physically assaults two drunken rednecks shooting at \" his \" birds . \nlater on , the rednecks come back for revenge with four other people , and hauer kills a few of them . \ni have a tough time believing that the police wouldn't get involved at that point . \nanother problem is the silly love-triangle that develops . \ni didn't care one way or the other who ended up with turner . \ni was more interested in finding out which of the two men would be victorious in their respective missions . \nhowever , despite this uninteresting sub-plot , turner did manage to give a great performance as the woman who reminds the two men that sometimes there's more to life than money and birds . \nas for hauer , he's an actor i've always admired . \nhe has a penchant for picking strange and unusual characters . \nand this one is no exception . \nhe's frequently seen riding around his island on a white horse , wearing pirate's clothing , and holstering a cross-bow . \ndespite all his eccentric mannerisms , though , hauer always manages to let the human side of his character shine through . \nfor example , there's a scene in which he barks at turner and her son because they came onto his island a day early . \nhe comes off as crazy loner in that scene , but a few minutes later , he is apologizing to turner , and we believe his intentions . \nsoon after , we find out he's a vietnam vet , and his actions become fairly clear to us . \n \" a breed apart \" isn't a great movie by any means , but it does contain good performances by all three leads , and it's worth seeing for that reason alone . \n", "titanic is so close to being the perfect movie it's upsetting that it isn't . \nthe film , which cost $200 million+ to make and could of put 20th century fox into a lot of finicial trouble if it 'sunk' ( pun intended ) is a labour of love for cameron , who wrote and directed the film . \nwe all know that big budget dosen't mean great film ( see waterworld ( 1995 ) ) but titanic is far superior to kevin costners waterlogged epic . \nbut sadly , titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece ( although it is one of cameron's best films ) \nthe film starts with present day explorers searching the runied titanic . \nthey find a safe , and inside a picture of a woman . \nthe woman in the picture ( an old winslet ) tells the explorers that the picture is of her . \nthe explorers invite her over , and she then tells her story of titanic . \nin the flashback , dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson , who , after winning a poker game , wins two tickets to board the grand ship titanic , leaving liverpool to go to america . \nalso boarding the ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater ( winslet ) who is being forced into a marriage with a man she dosen't love at all , cal hockley ( zane ) so her family can remain rich . \nshe nearly commits suicide on the ship , but jack comes to the rescue , saves rose , they fall in love , and cal gets jealous and eventually tries to kill them . \noh yeah , and the ship sinks . \nand that is the main problem with the film , and which stops it from being a work of genius . \nthe story and script ( both by cameron ) are both weak . \nthe story is full of cliched characters , ( the creepy man who the nice girl has to marry , the poor boy with heart , the stuck-up mother ) and poor dialogue ( the script consists of lots of in-jokes of how the boat won't sink , and most of the dialogue is pretty basic ) it's a shame really , as the audience does have to sit through 3 hours of this film . \nwithout good dialogue , a film could become a very long , very boring film ( like camerons own terminator 2 , 1992 ) but , luckily , there are some redeeming features that make the story and dialogue problems just disappear . \nfirstly , there's cameron's direction . \nthere are some great sweeping shots of the titanic , and some clever fades between the flashback titanic and the ruined titanic . \nbut the scenes cameron directs especially well are the disaster scenes at the end . \nthere is a lot of mayhem and panic , all done very well by cameron . \nit's a scary sight , watching bodies fall from great heights into the watery depths below . \nthanks to cameron's direction , then , the audiences attention is held for the full 3 hours 15 minutes . \nto support the directing are the excellent cast , working very well with their underwritten characters . \ndicaprio is good , although he only looks 16-17 years old . \nhis performance of a over excitiable , yet also well mannered boy is excellent , and he also has some funny lines . \nwinslet is great also , and her transistion from a well mannered rich girl to a rebelous young adult is pretty smooth . \nzane is deliciously evil as cal , saying every line with a sneer and a flicker of the eye lash . \nthe audience really does come to hate him . \nhe may be playing the same character he plays in every film he's in ( like dead calm , 1988 ) but he does it really , really well . \nalso worthy of note is kathy bates ( edward scissorhands , 1990 ) as a loud mouthed american . \nfinally , the icing on the 'great things' cake are the special effects . \ncameron is a whiz with effects ( just watch aliens ( 1988 ) , terminator 2 and true lies , 1994 ) and they are used very well throughout . \nthe sweeps of the ships are awesome , although digital domain , who did the effects , cannot animate human movement too well . \nthe humans seem to move to 'smoothly' , there's just something odd about them . \nyou can tell that they have been animated on a computer . \nof course , the ship sinking scenes are awesome , with bodies flying all over the place , and the scene where the ship splits in half has to be seen to be believed . \ntitanic is one of the only films where effects have reinforced the film . \ntitanic , then , is a wonder of directing , acting and cgi , but not writing and story . \nagain , like most of camerons films , the editing is loose ( cameron edits himself ) , and the film could of come in under three hours with a few more cuts . \ntitanic , then , although not the godfather of movies it could of been , is a wonderful attempt at creating a work of genius . \nenjoyable , scary , and even sad , titanic is a film cinema was invented for , filling the screen with incredible images , and assaulting the ears with awesome sound . \na superb film , but sadly not perfect . \noverall rating= ( \n", "on seeing the outrageous previews for bulworth one wonders what plot could possibly allow beatty get away with making those statements ( in case you missed it , warren beatty plays a politician on the campaign trail . \nhe says to a black congregation \" . . . if you can't cut down on malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind someone other than a running back who stabs his wife , you're never gonna get rid of me . \" ) \nwell , there is such a plot , and it works very well in this comedy . \nbeatty plays jay billington bulworth , a long-time democratic senator from california . \nthe movie opens on a painfully repetitious montage of bulworth's latest commercials condemning affirmative action . \nthe montage is ironically intercut with pictures of martin luther king and bulworth in his youth working with jack kennedy . \nwhen we finally lay eyes on bulworth he is morosely weeping in front of his tv , having gone without food or sleep for days . \nhis campaign is entering the final weekend before the primaries but his depression has sunk in too far for him to care . \nfirst he calls a lobbyist from the insurance industry to get a bribe - a $10 million life insurance policy in his daughter's name . \nthen he calls an associate to arrange for his own assassination . \nhis assistant murphy ( oliver platt ) is oblivious to bulworth's suicidal state and drags him to his speaking engagements . \nbulworth halfheartedly reads his speech at an african-american church , then takes questions from the audience . \nhe is hit hard with questions about his voting record . \nhe had promised money to help rebuild the community after the riots , and it hasn't shown up . \nsince he's a dead man anyway , he figures he'll answer truthfully : he and bill clinton and newt gingrich came to l . a . for the photo opportunity . \nthey made some promises that improved their public image for a while , and then counted on the media and the public to eventually forget about the promises they made . \nthe shock and outrage from the congregation grows , the questions keep coming , and he keeps shooting back honest , if ugly , answers . \n ( before i go further , i'd like to make a distinction that the denver post failed to make , and that is that characterizing african-americans as malt-liquor drinking o . j . \nfans is not part of bulworth's \" truth . \" \nthat line is in the trailers but it should not be praised like the other political confessions he makes in the movie . \nwhen the critics praise beatty for speaking the truth about politics , this line is not what they're talking about . ) \nthe experience is liberating . \nwith nothing left to lose , bulworth is no longer restricted to burping generic platitudes out of both sides of his mouth . \nhe can say whatever he wants because he's going to be dead anyway . \nwhy not tell the people the truth about being a sleazy politician - that he is bought and paid for by lobbyists , and that racism among the populace protects politicians from being the target of charges of classism ? \nbulworth's candor wins him three volunteers from the church , one of whom , nikki ( halle barry ) , he gets a crush on . \nhe feels so good afterwards that he actually eats something . \nchicken wings , appropriately enough . \nbulworth shows up late for his meeting with some movie studio executives . \nwhen one of them asks where he stands on government regulation of movie and tv ratings , bulworth drifts to the topic of the quality of filmed entertainment . \nwith so much money and so many talented people working so hard , he wonders , why can't hollywood make a quality product . \n ( you go , warren ! ) \nwhen they become indignant and ask why he's talking to them if he has such a low opinion of their product , he callously admits that it's because they are rich jews . \nthat night he drops the three african-american volunteers at their nightclub , and he decides to go in with them . \nhe stays up all night drinking , smoking pot , dancing , falling in love with nikki , and learning to scratch turntables and rap . \nthe next day , he shuns his prepared speech and instead raps to the suit-and-tie fundraisers . \nfrom then on , at all of his political appearances , he raps his political truth . \nhis rap is not bad for a middle-aged white guy . \nhe's not very good , but it is his first try and at least he's not embarrassingly bad . \nhis lobbyists are not amused , but the rest of his constituency seems to like the new bulworth . \neventually , the movie's plot ( remember he hired a hit man ? ) \novertakes the politics , which is too bad . \nscreen time is spent with bulworth trying to cancel the request for his assassination while the hit man seems to be closing in on him . \nthere are even a few gratuitous chase scenes , bulworth fleeing his killer . \nthese scenes may have been necessary to keep the events of the film moving along , but it distracted and detracted from bulworth's political ranting , which was much more interesting than the ever-present , obvious-looking assassin . \nstill , most of the movie is original and very enjoyable , and beatty deserves most of credit for bringing it to the screen . \nas the story and screen writer , he came up first with a good structure , then with good dialogue to back it up ( jeremy pikser co-wrote the screenplay ) . \nas an actor , he was able to convincingly portray bulworth's depression , then liberation and rebirth . \nas a producer ( there were four others ) he was able to keep the movie free from hollywood's indulgent formulas ( except for those inexcusable chase scenes ) . \nsomeone else probably could have directed , but since he was there anyway , what the heck . \nit's too bad that there aren't more movies like this around - movies that tackle political corruption in a way that challenges viewers to pay more attention to real politics . \nafter all , much of the inspiration for bulworth is straight out of the news . \njust a little perception and insight and you could write your own bulworth rants . \njust don't expect to be popular with the insurance companies . \n", "american pie acknowledges a cold , hard fact that most movies don't : it is very difficult to get laid . \nits four virgin heroes are jim ( biggs ) , a chronic masturbator , kev ( nicholas ) , who desperately wants to deflower his girlfriend ( reid ) , oz ( klein ) , a lacrosse player whose approach requires some fine tuning , and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) , a germphobe ( his crass nickname is hilarious , but i won't spoil it here ) who pays a classmate to spread rumours about the size of his member . \njim , kev , oz and finch attend a high school in suburban michigan full of so many impossibly beautiful women it's no wonder they're horny all the time . \nafter a party at their studly friend stifler's ( seann william scott , in the film's sharpest performance ) house leaves them sexually unsatisfied , the quartet make a pact : to \" lose it \" by graduation-specifically , prom night , which is only a few weeks away . \namerican pie is in the tradition of bachelor party or revenge of the nerds . \nalmost every conversation these characters have revolves around makin' whoopee . \nall women are there to be ogled . \n ( alyson hannigan's perky music student is the only memorable female of the bunch . ) \nsituations abound that defy logic only to arouse and/or amuse its core audience , adolescent boys . \n ( to arouse : nadia's ( shannon elizabeth ) internet striptease-an unexpectedly raucous ( and guiltily pleasurable ) sequence . \nto amuse : jim's lusty encounter with a hot apple pie . ) \nwhat differentiates american pie from those dirty eighties comedies , aside from a very nineties obsession with bodily fluids * , is a cast that's light years more appealing than that of , say , just one of the guys . \ntwo more standouts : klein and \" sctv \" 's eugene levy . \nklein plays a kind-hearted athlete for the second time in a row , after alexander payne's underappreciated election . \ni hope to see more of this warm actor with the disarmingly honest face very soon . \nlevy's is the most crowd-pleasing performance , and indeed , it's nice to see him back on the big screen in a role that makes wonderful use of that expressive brow . \namerican pie also wants to emulate the teen flicks your parents _would_ let you watch growing up . \nit skillfully employs a broad mix of pop tunes , much like john hughes' movies did , and even pays homage to the breakfast club a couple of times , most evidently when the prom band covers simple minds' \" don't you ( forget about me ) . \" \nthe picture ultimately has a healthy , if obligatory , attitude towards safe sex-even at their most libidinous , american pie's protagonists first whip out a condom . \nthe filmmakers prove that socially responsible raunch is possible . \nfor its familiarity and for its charming leads , i recommend american pie , but the buzz on this film had me expecting something . . . fresher . \nas far as the new teen cinema goes , it's at the top of the heap . \n * don't say i didn't warn you about the party scene . \n", "the 1998 summer movie season is still in its infancy . \nbut after diasappointing films such as \" godzilla \" and \" fear and loathing in las vegas \" , it would be nice to see a really good film . \nbut i doubt you could have expected this . \nthe truman show is one of the most unique films i have ever seen , and it deserves a spot on the \" decade's best \" list . \nthere is no way to isolate any single component of this picture and proclaim , \" yes , that's what makes this film great . \" \nthe blend of peter weir's masterful ( and in many ways brilliant ) direction , peter biziou's stunning photography and jim carrey's performance is what makes this film work so fantastically . \nthere is something strangely beautiful about every shot in the truman show . \nit may be the use of color or the placement of characters in the frame , but everything about this film looks intentional and perfect . \ncarrey has made a very wise choice . \nby playing mild-mannered truman burbank , he allows himself enough room to be comical , and therefore not alienating his true fans , while still showing a vulnerable and human side . \nthat is a side which has been missing from nearly every major character he has played in his numerous commercial successes . \ntruman burbank was born to an audience of millions . \nhe was chosen before birth to be the focus of a 24 hour television show . \neverything in his environment is controlled by a team of technicians , led by the show's director , christof ( played by ed harris ) . \neveryone in truman's life is an actor or an extra . \nthey are all being watched by millions of people around the globe , people who can tune in at any time of the day to see what is happening in truman's life . \nbut he is the only person that is not aware of it . \nthe classification of the truman show may be tricky . \nthe audience reacted to many of truman's revelations with laughter . \ni did not laugh much during the film because i was so emotionally wrapped up with the character . \nthe things that made the audience laugh gave me glassy eyes , because what was happening to him , indeed what had been done to him his whole life was wrong . \nso is this going to end up labeled as a comedy ? \na drama ? \nit really depends on the audience . \nbut to me , the truman show was a touching , sad tale about the extents to which a corporation will go to exploit human life for the entertainment of others . \nbut above all else , the truman show was a stunningly beautiful picture with humor , heart and scary realism . \noscar predictions in june are pointless , but if the truman show had been released on schedule in late fall or winter of 1997 , as originally planned , james cameron would be oscar-less . \n", "one way of telling if a film is good or not is by the length . \nif a film is only 90 minutes , but feels like 300 minutes , then it's crap . \nbut if a film last 2 1/2 hours , and feels like 90 minutes , then it's excellent . \nboogie nights falls into the latter catagory . \nthe director , anderson , delivers a funny , hip , yet sometimes violent film , which flies along . \nmark whalberg , a . k . a \nmarky mark , plays eddie adams , a seventeen year old with a certain 'gift' in the midriff area . \njack horner ( reynolds ) is a adult film director , who decides that eddie would be great in the adult movie business . \nafter running away from home , eddie joins jack , changes his name to dirk diggler , and starts making erotic movies . \nin the movie business , dirk meets a whole load of characters ( which the film introduces very quickly and slickly ) such as scotty ( phillip seymour hoffman ) , rollergirl ( graham ) amber ( moore ) and floyd ( phillip baker hall ) , and little bill ( william h . macy ) all the characters are well written , well played , and the audience gets to know them pretty well , thanks to the excellent script . \nwe learn about ambers grief about not being able to see her child due to a divorce , rollergirls hard time at school , and little bills wife , who sleeps with everyone except her husband . \nbut the best thing about the excellent boogie nights is paul andersons direction and writing . \nthe direction is fast , thrilling , and never holds up . \nthere are some great shots , some lovely steadiocam and handheld camera sequences , and lots of other neat directional touches . \nthe writing is fabulous , with some intelligent dialogue , some funny dialogue , but none of the dialogue is crap , like most hollywood films ( such as the lost world : jurassic park ( 1997 ) , or tommorow never dies ( 1997 ) . ) \nboogie nights really is a spectacular feat of direction and writing , on par ( and sometimes betters ) quentin tarantino's films resevoir dogs ( 1992 ) and pulp fiction ( 1994 ) \nthe soundtrack is also excellent . \nlike american graffiti ( 1973 ) , the film features some great old songs on the soundtrack , which heightens the atmosphere , and gives the film an extra lift . \nalso , the costumes are great . \nthe clothes really do look like what people wore in the seventies and eighties . \nthe film , although excellent , does have some flaws . \nfirstly , wahlberg , although excellent , cannot do highly scenes which require him to be angry . \nin both scenes where he has to act angry , his acting is so 'off' , the scenes tension and anger is lost . \nbut the rest of the cast are excellent . \nburt reynolds is brilliant , julianne moore shows real emotion , and william h . macy is great aswell ( but he always is . ) \nanother flaw with the film , though , is that the ending seems a bit tacked on . \nit seems anderson saw the film was going on a bit , and needed to wrap up quickly . \nit's a shame , really , as the rest of the film is perfectly paced . \nbut they're small niggles really . \nboogie nights is an excellent film . \nsuperb directing , writing , acting and music , all combine to make one spectacular film . \nwhatever you do , do not miss out on boogie nights . \n", "it's ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the original director's cut of the film . \nfilms such as aliens , the abyss , the wild bunch , blade runner , and terminator 2 are all prime examples of a filmmaker's integrity , later chopped up or mucked with by the studio . \nthe advent of the dvd format has provided a more accessible way to get these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of such classic films . \nthe dvd release of the original international version of luc besson's 1995 masterpiece the professional , which is known as l ? on around the world , is a prime example of how a good film can become an instant classic as a director's cut . \nfor years , i have heard of an \" international \" version available only in laserdisc format , which has eluded me for years . \ni even bought a laserdisc player from my uncle don for 100 bucks just to watch certain directors' cuts - including l ? on . \nbut after countless searches in laserdisc stores , i could never find it . \nuntil now . \nthe film follows the story of l ? on , played by jean reno , a professional hit man for an italian mob crew run by danny aiello . \nhe lives next door to a ferociously independent 12-year-old girl named mathilda - played by then newcomer natalie portman , whose father is involved in drugs and crooked cops . \none day , a crew of the cops - lead by gary oldman in an over-the-top performance - kills her entire family while mathilda is out buying groceries . \ntaking pity on her , l ? on hides her in his apartment when she returns to save her life . \nmathilda learns of l ? on's hit man profession and decides to follow in l ? on's footsteps as a \" cleaner . \" \nshe then falls in love with him and manages to reawaken emotions within l ? on he has kept locked away as part of his profession . \nat this point , the differences in the american version and the international version really kick in . \nthe international version contains an additional 24 minutes of footage that pertains directly to the relationship of l ? on and mathilda , footage that american censors deemed \" too explicit . \" \ni assume that american censors feel that defining character development is too much for american audiences to handle . \nthe best part of this extra footage is that gives better understanding of both mathilda's and l ? on's motivations pertaining to later actions involving oldman and his crew of bad cops . \nthere's even a previously unseen cameo by the great french actor jean-hugues anglade - star of queen margot , besson's la femme nikita , and killing zoe . \nwith these additional scenes replaced , l ? on and matilda's relationship brings you emotionally closer to the film and draws stronger bonds between the characters that were murky in the american version . \nthe most ironic thing about the international version of the film is that with the inclusion of the missing scenes , the film becomes primarily a heavy , emotional drama punctuated with big action scenes at the beginning and the end of the film . \nthe film betters reflects the serious drama of french cinema but is laced with pieces reflecting the brutality of american cinema . \nmy advice to everyone out there is to throw away your copy of the professional , throw down twenty bucks , and pick up this newly restored cinematic masterpiece . \ndirector/writer : luc besson producer : luc besson , claude besson starring : jean reno , natalie portman , gary oldman , danny aiello \n", "while it was part of former yugoslavia , my country , croatia , used to be almost completely ignored by western films in general . \nwords \" croatia \" and \" croatians \" were unheard , even in movies whose plots actually took place on croatian locations . \nthe rare exception was the dogs of war , 1980 adaptation of frederick forsyth's bestselling novel , yet that rare occasion only added insult to the injury , by mentioning croatians in most unflattering context . \nin a single line they are referred as a bunch of mean people , probably terrorists , who happen to remove parts of arm dealers' stomachs when they are unsatisfied with the quality of merchandise . \nsame line also illustrates the milieu where the movie takes place - dark and violent world of shady international deals with the blurred boundaries between business , politics and crime . \nthe movie protagonist , shannon ( christopher walken ) is a mercenary who spent the best years of his life fighting numerous little wars all over the globe . \nhis latest job is a intelligence mission for powerful mining corporation that demands information about political climate in west african nation of zangaro . \nshannon arrives in that country only to find oppressive regime of president kimba , bloodthirsty madman whose brutality crushed any opposition and scared almost any westerners away . \nafter being arrested and tortured by kimba's secret police , shannon leaves country with a help of british journalist north ( colin blakely ) . \nupon return , he is approached by mining company again , but this time they want him to plan and execute the coup d'etat against kimba . \nshannon reluctantly agrees and assembles small group of his surviving mercenary friends who begin meticulous preparation for another small war . \nthing that separates the dogs of war from conventional action movies , especially those made in 1980s , is its authenticity , almost close to documentary . \nit shouldn't surprise anyone , because the author of the novel , frederick forsyth , made reputation by blending fiction with real life , thus creating interesting , exciting yet very believable plots for his books . \nthose plots were also responsible for few very successful 1970s thrillers , and one of them , zinnemman's the day of the jackal , is now considered a classic in that genre . \nthis one deals with soldiers of fortune , ancient tradition that was resurrected in great turmoil of 1960s and 1970s and filled the void left by vanishing colonial empires . \nunlike wild geese , that used it as a pretext for conventional action adventure , script by george malko and gary de vore ( author whose death last year became real life mystery ) is serious , and instead of action puts emphasis on characters and prosaic details of their work . \nthe movie doesn't try to romanticise the mercenary profession nor glorify mercenaries as some kind of superheroes ; they are simply shown as deadly yet expendable tool of powerful forces with questionable agenda . \nchristopher walken played in many movies , yet very rarely we can see him in a leading role . \nhis performance in this film perhaps isn't breathtaking , yet adequate . \nhis notoriously expressionless face is perfect illustration of the disillusioned , world- weary man whose alienation from the \" normal \" way of life becomes complete and only remaining ideal is loyalty to the shrinking circle of friends . \nalthough the movie doesn't lack capable actors , their roles are miniature compared with walken's , and only colin blakely as cynical reporter has opportunity to portray his character . \nhowever , those who look familiar faces would find them plenty in the dogs of war - tom berenger , paul freeman , jo beth williams , victoria tennant ( in brief cameo ) , and biggest surprise is ed o'neill ( of married with children fame ) as shannon's reluctant colleague . \nthis was the first major production for john irvin , and it shows why he earned the reputation of capable , yet second class director . \nwith the good script he can make very good movie , with the bad script he can make real mess . \nluckily , the dogs of war had a good script . \nirvin's direction was very ascetic and it gave the movie almost documentary feel . \nthe only distraction is dramatic music of geoffrey burgon , used on the wrong places . \nin the final battle scene , where we can see mercenaries at work , irvin shows us that modern warfare means superior firepower and tactics , unlike 1980s ramboesque fantasies that rely on macho superheroes . \nunfortunately , by making battle realistic irvin made it somewhat less attractive and his sloppy editing also didn't help . \nbut , despite those shortcomings , this movie remains interesting and rare combination of action thriller and gritty , realistic political drama . \n", "the happy bastard's quick movie review \nanalyze this \nhow does one do a comedy focused on the mob ? \nwell , a few years ago , there was a sly little comedy called the freshman , which had marlon brando doing a romp of a send-up of his famous don corleone character and , recently , the utterly stupid ( in a bad way ) movie mafia ! \nfailed to really get the joke . \nthis time around , however , warner bros . may have gotten it right with analyze this , a movie that hits its targets more than it misses . . . and \nfor plenty of reasons . \nthe story goes like this . \na mobster ( robert deniro ) finds himself receiving several panic attacks as of late , fueled by the stress of an upcoming mobster meeting and a near-death following a drive-by shooting . \nit's these attacks that prompt him to hire a psychiatrist ( billy crystal ) who's mostly reluctant to take the mobster's case for two reasons . \nfirst , of course , he's a mobster , but secondly , he's trying to get married and enjoy a quiet honeymoon with his wife ( lisa kudrow ) and kid . \nand , of course , he can't rest worth for a moment because the mobster's goons are always needing the shrink for something , be it a quick consultation or dream analyzation . \nfortunately , the movie is played out for plenty of laughs . \ndirector harold ramis ( who also helmed the comedy multiplicity , which wasn't half bad ) keeps the tone peppy and light , even if it's sometimes sprinkled by slight dramatic moments ( shootings can't always be taken for laughs , you know ) . \ndeniro does some of his finest comic work since the king of comedy , giving off a somewhat similar performance to his role in goodfellas , but with a bit of a lighter heart . \n ( a scene where he tries to display his anger over the phone and fails miserably is hilarious . ) \ncrystal plays an excellent straight man to deniro's character , uplifting him from such bombs as father's day and my giant . \nkudrow is also a hoot as crystal's wife-to-be , who's on the verge of a breakdown thanks to deniro's presence . \nis the movie perfect ? \nnot really , thanks to a simplistic ending and some slightly wasted moments with a character portrayed by chazz palminteri ( he's a comic actor , too , come on , give him some more ! ) , but it is an enjoyable romp that lets deniro do something different but same for a change , taking his dramatic act to a new field of comedy . \nkudos to crystal and kudrow for not just making it his show , either . \nline of the movie : crystal : \" when you said you needed family therapy , this is not the family i had in mind ! \" \n", "this is a film about secrets , some that are innocent like those of a cute little farm girl , frances boyd ( ashley ) . \nothers that are between a married couple that is impacting their relationship , like the problems of infertility affecting this upwardly mobile couple , geoffrey gaines ( stephen ramsey ) , the medical researcher working for a big corporation called fex and striving to get a patent for his experiment and become recognized in his field , and his artist wife , lillian ( miriam healy-louie ) , who reluctantly stands behind her husband suppressing her natural artistic tendencies in order to make the marriage work . \nand , still other secrets that have a greater implication for the world and are deadly in a political sense , of science carried out by the big corporations like it was a business run for the bottom line . \nreceiving a summer grant to study \" chemo-electric therapy , \" geoffrey and his wife are hoping that a summer spent away from the intensity of the big city will bring back the romance that is dwindling from their marriage and that the casualness of the country atmosphere will give them more time together , as their three-year marriage has become shaky because he is more interested in his work than he is in her . \nhe has slyly managed to keep his work as secretive as possible by locking himself in the lab , which is off limits to her , as he secretly goes about conducting experiments on rats and mice , convincing her that what he is doing is to benefit humanity with possible new treatments and cures to illnesses . \nhis main argument is , that this is what the public wants , they don't want to hear about how some animals had to die because of these experiments , they just want the benefits of science . \nthat he is depicted as a monster creating another monster , much like frankenstein was created , is the argument skewed by the director against his bad science ( science as a business ) as opposed to the good science ( science that cares about the small farmer ) , which is represented by the handsome and almost perfect gentleman , alex vine ( david ) , a young ecologist who chooses to work in the field , trying to get the farmers to go back to organic farming . \nhe is hired by the university to monitor the dangers of pesticides and all the chemicals the farmer is almost forced to use to survive financially , as it is doing irreparable harm to him and the consumer because of all the health risks attached to this new way of farming , methods that have just come about in the last thirty- years and are being pushed by the big companies to enhance their profit margins . \nthe third view in all this is the artist's , represented by lillian , who points out that the artist's work is shown in public and scrutinized constantly , \" why shouldn't the same be true of the scientist ? \" \nshe argues that the artist is the watchdog for the public , questioning what is good or evil in society , something that bad science has completely ignored . \ngeoffrey , impatient to get ahead with his research , feels bogged down by the bureaucrats in his firm who fail to provide him with the three chimps he needs to experiment on , as he contacts one of the company's higher ups to argue his case , but decides he can't wait any longer for their help , so he sets an animal trap in the countryside and catches chester , the gorgeous pet dog of frances , a dog that means so much to her and her family because he saved her life . \nwhile out in the field with the bloodied trapped dog already in the back seat of his car , he is spotted by alex and one of his co-workers , and nervously invites them to dinner with his wife , afraid that alex will spot what he is doing , as he rushes away from the area . \nin the dinner scene that was , unfortunately , flatly done , but was nevertheless the heart of the film , as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat , a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything . \nthe scientists engage in a rational argument , highlighting their different points of view , while lillian reacts in an emotional way , siding mostly with david's view but coming at it from a much different angle . \nit was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies . \nthat the director's point of view is absolutely right , is beside the point . \nthe point is that the characters lost their humanity and became one-dimensional characters . \ngeoffrey was likened to a hideous monster , alex vine was likened to his last name , the one who holds fast to the ground ensuring that the plant has stability , while lillian was likened to the muse of poetry and art , the inspiration for goodness and beauty . \nalex has been spending a lot of time together with lillian , as these two seem to share the same views and are physically attracted to each other , but when the time is ripe for an affair to take place between them , lillian changes her mind and decides not to go up to alex's apartment . \ngeoffrey is already suspicious of alex and considers him an enemy , and the marriage seems to be coming apart and all his cunning tricks to possess her are no longer working , as it is now impossible to see any good in him and there becomes no reason why she would remain with him . \nthe relationship has disintegrated way beyond the point of her just feeling lonely . \nthe dog is discovered by alex and her in a deplorable state after geoffrey is seen by them electrically shocking it , and mercifully the dog dies . \nthe only thing left for her to do is walk out of the marriage , but she also fails to respond to david's loving gesture for her to stay with him , instead opting to head back to the city . \nthe farmer whose dog was tortured to death comes into the scientist's lab and knocks him cold while he was in the middle of a phone conversation with one of the higher-ups who told him all the animals he needs are on the way . \nwhat is progress ? \nwhat can one expect out of life ? \nis the small farmer about to become extinct ? \nthe answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art , which are both closely related to the american natives vision of a world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in a peaceful way . \nthat this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions , leaving no room for deeper arguments , is the shame of this decent and smart film , that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so black and white . \nno telling said a lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in ; it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic . \nthere is something about listening to a lecture that turns off the rebel in me , as i don't like being hit in the head with the truth but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically . \nthat is not to say that i found the film without considerable merit , that inspite of its shortcomings , it was worth seeing because of its visual statements , though they were also not too subtle , they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed to show that there is a mental war going on currently , of those who believe one way is right and others who differ with them , and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference . \nthe stakes in this ecological struggle are that high . \nperhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film , was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene . \nit was the image that lillian spent her time painting all summer and had the same affect for her as did the animal faces in picasso's guernica had for him . \nboth artists envisioned the horrors that man could do against the world , and represented this unspoken pain on the faces of the animals so that anyone who cares to really see what is going on , will not mistake which side of the fence he or she should be on . \nthe pain that lillian feels , as she forgets about her desires to raise a family , and she stares at her painting of the cow and the song , \" make the world go away \" blares out from the background , after she has learned that frances' beautiful and loving dog has been brutalized by her monster of a husband , all in the name of science , had a raw power to it that personalizes the dangers of bad science . \nperhaps , the most pertinent question the film asks , requires an answer that must be resolved by the farmers and the consumers who are most caught in the changing world and its new way of doing business , as the question becomes , can science be happily married with art ? \n", "this british import follows the ( mis- )

tables on the jocks with some clowning around , but he takes it too far , and is embarassed in front of the entire school . \nthe next scene is brilliant . \nmaggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally . \nshe tries to talk to him as if nothing happened . \nhe rails back against her , in a cruel unfair fashion . \nin lesser movies this would've turned into a confrontation between the two characters . \nbut maggie is written smarter than that . \nshe understands what lucas is feeling and knows exactly what to say to console him . \nnext we are introduced to another great character named cappie ( charlie sheen ) . \nhe is a jock with a typical cheerleader girlfriend . \nwhat's interesting about him is that he sticks up for lucas and protects him from the other jocks . \nof course anyone with a brain can tell what's gonna happen next . \ncappie will cause conflict in maggie and lucas' relationship . \nthis begins in classic scene in the school laundry room when cappie and maggie are alone . \nshe's been assigned to show him how to operate the washer/dryer so he can clean his shirt . \nmaggie is charmed by cappie's tender undertsanding demeanor , not to mention his shirtless body . \nthis scene is so delicate and sweet , but cappie still has a girlfriend , preventing either one from acting on their desires . \ndesperately trying to puncture the tension , cappie begins to kick basketballs around the room . \nit's not long before cappie does break up with his girlfriend ( in the films only subpar scene ) . \nlucas finally figures out what's going on when he tries to pick maggie up for the dance . \nthis causes him to take severe actions to prove himself to maggie and himself , such as try out for the football team . \nthe last third of the film revolves around this attempt . \nwhile the idea seems cliched , the way it is executed is not . \nthere are many surprises during the last half hour which lead to an ending so emotionally involving it should make the most heartless of cynics get choked up . \ndave grusin's memorable score , played at the perfect moments , certainly helps . \nlucas is filled with great performances . \nforget everything you know about corey haim . \nback in 1986 he had talent , and that is proven here as he delivers a perfect fully 3-dimensional performance filled with anger , humor , and pain . \nkerri green is very appealing as maggie , showing us why she cares about lucas so much and why he is so attracted to her . \nsheen's cappie is almost too good to be true , but sheen makes him beleivable , especially when he explains the reason why he protects lucas . \nthere are other wonderful minor characters such as ciro popitti's ben , a friend of lucas , whose diminutive stature does not mean he will take crap from the jocks . \nalso turning up in a few key scenes is winona ryder as rina , the girl who admires lucas from afar . \nwhen people talk about the great teen angst films of the 80s , you hear john hughes this and john hughes that . \nlucas seems to be lost among the crowd of his so-called classics . \nbut hopefully , like with heathers and say anything , lucas can begin to find it's own loyal following and help people realize there were more to the 80s than anthony michael hall and molly ringwald . \nit deserves more than that , but i don't want to be greedy . \n", "in arguably the most anticipated movie this century , george lucas has achieved a very mixed reaction to a sure blockbuster . \ndespite the fact the script and plot is a bit of a let down , the entire movie on the whole can be considered a milestone in technical excellence , in the sound and special effects department . \nin terms of characters , by far the most outstanding and interesting is queen amidala ( natalie portman ) , whose mature performance far exceeds her tender 14 years of age . \nshe is one ? hot' babe who defines true ? woman leadership' . \nshe not only has a presence , but knows how to take command of the situation and save her planet from ruination . \nno thanks to the jedi knights who although led by the force , lack leadership qualities in terms of thinking up a plan to do anything . \nthe young obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) who has a bad hair day in every scene , gets to kill a bad guy in the end , but lacks a love interest to make him a desirable sort of hero . \nin fact all the jedi knight are a bit asexual - there must be something about the force which makes them all hermits and loners . \ni mean it would be interesting to see yoda's girlfriend for a change , if he has one . \nnot much better is qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) who mostly broods , and has a better hair do than obi-wan , but only to find the young anakin skywalker and make the biggest mistake of his life . \nalso fascinating is george lucas ? metoclorian' theory , which claims that micro-organisms live within our cells and tie us to the fabric of the universe . \nand it is the high concentrations of these organisms in an individual which make them particularly powerful in the force . \nmore humerous are the claims to the immaculate conception of darth vader , no doubt a concept stolen from the christian faith , except there will be no christmas to celebrate the birth of this dark emissary of the force . \noverall an experience which is not to be missed because of the very fact that it's predecessor almost command a viewing of this inferior successor . \nby all means not the pinnacle of the star wars phenomena but an adequate addition to the clan . \nwatch out for the next one , it should be one steamy encounter between queen amidala and anakin skywalker - who i believe should be portrayed by ? leonardo di caprio . \n", "felix ( sami bouajila , \" the siege \" ) lives a contented life with his boyfriend daniel ( pierre-loup rajot ) in the little town of dieppe in northern france . \nwhen he is laid off from his job , after discovering the address of the father who abandoned him before he was born , he decides to journey to marseilles , in the south , to find the man he never met in \" the adventures of felix . \" \nwriters/directors olivier ducastel and jacques martineau made their debut with the musical comedy \" jeanne and the perfect guy , \" embracing that typically american genre . \ntheir second effort , \" the adventures of felix , \" once again borrows from america with a tale of a young man who hits the road to find himself . \nfelix is happy with his life in dieppe , but when the ferry company he works for falls prey to the economics of the chunnel , he is out of a job and at loose ends . \nwhen he goes through his late mother's papers he learns that the father he never knew is living in marseilles , hundreds of miles away . \nfelix makes the snap decision to journey to the south , puts together a supply of \" cocktails \" for his hiv virus , kisses daniel goodbye and heads off on foot . \nhe refuses to use trains and wants to avoid big cities as he hitchhikes across france to find his destiny . \nalong the way , a series of chance encounters with various strangers teaches felix that family is not always made up of blood relations . \non the road , he witnesses a race-related mugging that turns into murder and , frightened for his own safety , runs away without telling the police . \nfollowing this harrowing experience , he has his first chance meeting that begins the unconscious construction of his ideal family . \nhis journey brings him to rouen , and the film's first title section , \" my little brother , \" where he meets jules , a young art student who becomes smitten with felix . \nthey steal a car and develop a chaste , brotherly affection before felix must move on . \nhe next meets elderly mathilde ( patachou ) , in the chapter titled \" my grandmother , \" and soon learns that she , too , has a fondness for the same tv soap opera that felix has grown addicted to . \nshe wants him to stay with her , but he must continue on his way to find his father . \nin the weakest chapter of felix's road trip , titled \" my cousin , \" he meets a railroad worker ( philippe garziano ) and has a brief sexual encounter before heading off , once again , toward marseilles . \nhe next helps a stranded lady motorist , isabelle ( ariane ascaride ) , and shags a ride with her and her three kids ( each with a different daddy ) in the sequence titled \" my sister . \" \nhe is torn by the inner turmoil of not going to the police about the murder he witnessed and isabelle comforts him just as a sister would . \non the final leg of the journey titled \" my father , \" he meets an older man , a fisherman ( maurice benichou ) , who enlightens him about the real facts of life and family while they fly felix's kite , just like a father and son . \n \" the adventures of felix \" has a number of things going for it as we follow felix on his journey of discovery . \nfirst and foremost is the charming performance by sami bouajila as felix . \nhe is a likable guy , fighting his hiv with his doses of \" cocktails , \" and lights up the screen as he makes the long walk , often with dance and song , to find his father and himself . \nas he encounters each member of his new family , promising each that he will send a postcard when he arrives at his final destination , he grows a little bit more spiritually and emotionally . \nbouajila does a terrific job holding center stage on the screen . \nthe cast of characters making up felix's new-found family are nearly as charming as the star , each in their own way . \npatachou , especially , is wonderful as the grandma character and a kindred spirit to felix . \nariane ascaride , along with her kids , gives a perf that really makes you think of her as the sister that the young man never had . \nonly the \" cousin \" chapter lacks the emotional depth of the rest and feels like a perfunctory addition to felix's \" family . \" \n \" the adventures of felix \" does not reinvent the road movie , but it does provide a charismatic telling of a young man's journey to find himself and , to his surprise , his discovery is dramatically different than he expected at the beginning . \nit helps that cinematographer matthieu poirot-delpech's crisp lensing compliments the story perfectly as felix moves across the french countryside . \ni give it a b+ . \n", "i know that \" funnest \" isn't a word . \n \" fun \" is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective . \nbut that's the word that came to me right after viewing \" chicken run . \" \nno wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like \" that was the funnest movie i've ever seen ! \" \nso to hell with webster's -- \" chicken run \" is one of the funnest movies i've seen in a while . \ni can't remember the last time i've seen anything funner . \nthe chickens at tweedy's farm are up to something . \nliving in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box . \none night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer . \nrocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs . tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm's egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan . \nshe orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , \" chickens go in ; pies come out . \" \nwhat sort of pies ? \nchicken pies , of course . \nco-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : \" creature comforts , \" \" the wrong trousers , \" and \" a close shave . \" \nthe latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures . \npart of what made the \" wallace \" films brilliantly entertaining was park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new . \n \" the wrong trousers , \" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and \" a close shave \" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories . \nbut in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived . \nnow teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in \" chicken run . \" \nthe plot is largely lifted from \" the great escape \" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement . \nthing is , the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from somewhere else ; \" chicken run \" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done . \npart of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? \npark and lord milk the incongruity for all it's worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is . \nbut they're * chickens * , so it's funny to us . \nanother thing that helps \" chicken run \" ( and most of park's films ) succeed is the animators' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they're cribbing . \nthere are references to \" the great escape , \" obviously , and \" stalag 17 . \" \nthe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both \" raiders of the lost ark \" and \" indiana jones and the temple of doom . \" \nthere's even a nod to \" the blues brothers , \" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson's nationality and film history . \nthe \" braveheart \" reference is a hoot if you catch it . \nwhen you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , \" chicken run \" is downright brilliant in its execution . \nconsider this : since july of last year , i've seen dozens upon dozens of \" blair witch project \" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online . \nout of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome . \nwhy ? \nbecause once you got past the thought that \" they're parodying that 'blair witch' movie , \" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose . \nthey were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing . \nconversely , \" chicken run \" doesn't lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . \nif you've never seen \" indiana jones , \" the chase sequence is still fun . \neven if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character . \npark , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it's understood , and as a result , \" chicken run \" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either . \nenjoyment of this movie doesn't require knowledge of film history , but if you've got it , \" chicken run \" is that much richer . \nthe voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it's hard not to fall in love with every one of them . \nginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on \" absolutely fabulous \" ) nails it . \nshe has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer . \nthe characters' inevitable romance doesn't feel contrived , but sweet . \npoor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn't any help . \njane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence . \nthey even come up with an inspired riff on something that's baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . \none might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of \" chicken run , \" it comes as a delightful surprise . \nthe film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens . \nthe animation is first-rate . \nremember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable \" chicken run \" really is . \nthis movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail . \nas in such top-notch family fare as \" a bug's life \" or \" toy story 2 , \" \" chicken run \" has something to offer in nearly every frame . \ncertainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they'll catch all the details . \nanyway , the movie's just a boatload of fun . \nfunnest damn movie i've seen all year . \n", "after the press screening of \" moulin rouge , \" i stood in the lobby of the theater listening to the reactions of my friends and colleagues . \neveryone seemed a bit numb , understandable after sitting through a barrage of often-incongruous sounds and images . \na pal of mine simply said that he loved the film and could hardly wait to take his wife to see it . \nanother enthusiast immediately began to analyze the production , while a woman who flat-out hated the movie gave him the skunk eye . \nwhen one fellow quietly stated \" i've never really been a fan of musicals , \" the statement surprised me because , even though the story is told almost completely through song , i didn't think of it as a musical . \nthere is so much going on in \" moulin rouge \" that \" musical \" seems too small a term to cover it . \n \" moulin rouge \" is the kind of creation that sends critics scurrying off to the big tub o' adjectives in search of proper words to describe the experience . \naustralian director baz luhrmann , the man behind \" strictly ballroom \" and \" romeo + juliet , \" fills the heads of viewers with unique camerawork , opulent imagery and songs ranging from \" the sound of music \" to \" smells like teen spirit . \" \nsumptuous and beautiful , vulgar and overdone , \" moulin rogue \" travels through the looking glass while an ethereal stereo loaded with 50 years worth of catchy tunes operates on the \" random \" setting . \noh , and it has a story as well . \n \" it was 1899 , the summer of love . . . \n \" christian ( ewan mcgregor ) is a penniless young writer newly arrived in paris , \" to write about truth , beauty , freedom and love , \" where he encounters a group of bohemians , led by henri de toulouse-lautrec ( john leguizamo ) . \nchristian meets satine ( nicole kidman ) , a courtesan from the legendary moulin rogue , and his world transforms from black and white to technicolor . \nat once fragile and vivacious , the dazzling red-haired woman sweeps him off his feet without even trying . \nchristian instantly falls in love with her and satine finds herself smitten with him as well , which is quite a hindrance for someone in her profession . \nworking with the bohemians and moulin rogue impresario harold zidler ( jim broadbent ) , christian writes an opus modestly named \" spectacular spectacular . \" \nzidler quickly finds a backer , the wealthy duke of monroth ( richard roxburgh ) , but there's a catch ? the duke also wants the hand of the fair satine . \nas if all that isn't enough , satine has a cough , and while a cough in the real world probably indicates a cold , it rarely turns out to be anything that simple in movie land . \nlike a teeter-totter , \" moulin rogue \" moves up and down between the ridiculous and the sublime . \none of the loveliest moments comes as christine and satine commune outdoors at night , becoming part of a defiantly unrealistic parisian cityscape straight from a book of fairy tales . \ntogether they dance , while serenaded by the man in the moon ( alessandro safina provides the vocals ) , apparently transported from the classic georges m ? li ? s silent film to guard the nocturnal sky . \nother scenes merely traffic in everything-and-the-kitchen-sink overload . \nthe cavorting of toulouse-lautrec and his comrades gets strained at times and some of their overt comedy , accompanied by cartoon sound effects , is overly reminiscent of the frenzied farce that sitcoms like \" bewitched \" beat into the ground . \nof course , sensory overload was exactly what baz luhrmann had in mind . \n \" we never heard from baz to turn it down , \" one of the actors told the los angeles times . \n \" it was always , 'more ! \nmore ! ' \" \nthe director even sent a note to his cast reading , \" i dare you to make me say you've gone too far . \" \nthe musical numbers reflect his attitude . \none knockout piece , the \" elephant love medley , \" incorporates the beatles' \" all you need is love , \" u2's \" in the name of love , \" dolly parton's \" i will always love you \" and elton john and bernie taupin's \" your song . \" \nneed more ? \nhow about \" diamonds are a girl's best friend \" spiced with portions of \" material girl ? \" \nluhrmann's cast offers a wide variety of approaches that , together , add up to something messy , but often wonderful . \newan mcgregor is extremely likable as christian , emphasizing the sincerity of the love-struck poet . \nmcgregor's singing voice is robust and adds vigor at just the right moments . \nonce labeled the \" ice queen , \" nicole kidman melts that characterization with a sizzling , yet tender , performance . \nshe handles the songs adroitly , although her voice sounds a bit thin in the upper range . \nveteran character actor jim broadbent is suitably larger than life as ringmaster zidler ? wait until you see him perform \" like a virgin . \" \nas the buffoonish duke , richard roxburgh proves to be the film's weakest link , although i'm sure he was simply following instructions . \ni suspect \" moulin rogue \" will be one of those love-it-or-hate-it films . \nwhile i didn't completely love it , i most certainly liked it a lot . \nover the course of a year , i see well over 300 movies , and most of them look like xeroxes of each other . \n \" moulin rogue \" is an original , and an original , even a flawed one , is a thing to be cherished . \n", " \" living out loud , \" is the type of motion picture we don't often see : it is a film about mature , intelligent adults , instead of the usual american film , in which children basically dress up in grown-up clothing and parade around acting like immature seven-year-olds . \njudith ( holly hunter ) , a fortysomething living in new york city , has been having a difficult time with life lately . \nshe is extremely depressed about her recent divorce to her husband ( martin donovan ) , who had been cheating on her . \nshe cannot sleep , haunted by terrible memories , often imagines off-the-wall things to try and make the world seem like a better place , and the only place she can really go to feel happy is to hear one of her favorite singers , liz bailey ( queen latifah ) , perform at a local club . \njudith's life does start to brighten a little when , one night when she gets home to her apartment late , strikes up a conversation with the elevator operator , pat ( danny devito ) , a lonely man in his fifties whom has lost his daughter recently . \nboth of them create a sort of emotional connection with each other , seeking comfort with the other person , but while pat starts to form a deep love for her , judith only wants to remain friends . \n \" living out loud , \" which was written by richard lagravenese ( \" the bridges of madison county \" ) , who is also making his directing debut here , is a wonderful film from beginning to end , one that is honest , genuinely funny , and poignant . \nthe three central characters , that of judith , pat , and liz , are all written to be free-thinking , complex human beings , and are all likable , but flawed , people who are constantly interesting , as is the film itself . \none highly original element of the film is that judith occasionally imagines things occuring in her mind in the way she wishes they would happen . \nsometimes it results in comedy , and sometimes it turns out to be subtle and truly touching . \none sequence that stands out is when judith is at a restaurant by herself , reading a novel . \nan older woman comes over to her , mentions that that is a great book she is reading , and then goes over to join her own friends . \nas the woman sits down , she looks over to see judith by herself , and motions for her to come join them . \ninstantly , we realize this was simply in judith's mind , as we see the same woman just sit down at the table and begin talking to her friends . \nholly hunter and danny devito both give the performances of their careers here . \nhunter , of course , was brilliant in 1993's \" the piano , \" for which she won an academy award , but in this film she is even better , i think . \nshe finds the right note for each scene and holds it . \nand devito has never had such a humanistic role before , which i was surprised about . \nusually he is used as the butt of a joke , or as a caricature , but in this film , has a living-and-breathing , sympathetic person to play . \ntopping it all off is latifah , also a singer , who is quickly turning into a respectable actress herself , and has a juicy , natural supporting role as , in some ways , judith's role model . \nanother joy of the film is that it does not somehow form a contrived , \" happy \" ending , but , in staying with its realistic tone , manages to be upbeat , but truthful . \nthe last shot is an especially powerful image . \nnothing is said , but just the image of someone walking down a sidewalk says it all . \nthe relationship that results between judith and pat is true-to-life and sincere . \nas we watch these two people talk , and get to know each other , all that we wish for them both is to be happy , even if that does not include for them to become romantically involved . \nand as , \" living out loud , \" which is one of the best films of the year , proves , sometimes a friendship is the strongest bond anyone could possibly ask for . \n", "`oh behave ! \nfelicity shagwell is one shagadellic babe . \ndo i make your horny ?

direct the screen version of a popular novel . \nthe novel was a summer smash , topping best-seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads . \nthe only problem : the novel wasn't very good . \nit was far more pulp than pulitzer . \nbut the director realized that , no matter how pedestrian the prose , this book really grabbed people - that the author , while not a great writer , was a fantastic storyteller . \nso he took on the project , convinced he could make something happen on screen . \nthe director ? \nfrancis ford coppola . \nthe book , of course , was mario puzo's the godfather . \nthe rest , as they say in showbiz , was history . \nby bringing up the godfather , i don't mean to suggest that robert altman's the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness . \nbut the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material . \ncan you get any more questionable than john grisham ? \ndepends on whom you ask . \nbut there's no question that grisham's work grabs people . \nlike puzo , grisham is a better storyteller than a writer - unlike fellow hack michael crichton , who is a good idea man but who can't tell a well-constructed story from a can of spam . \nso something in grisham's unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman , who at 73 years old remains one of america's greatest living filmmakers . \nthe result is a gripping thriller that , while falling short of classic cinema , deserves its place in the altman canon . \n>from its opening shot to the closing credits , the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread , with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe . \nthis terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch . \nwitness said opening shot : we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing , undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear . \nwe roll over the hills into the town of savannah , then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone . \nright away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises . \npay attention , boys and girls - this shot was not conceived by john grisham , but by altman . \nthis is what a great director can do for questionable source material . \nthe sports car belongs to rick magruder ( kenneth branagh ) , the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases . \nmagruder has just won a high profile case and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office . \noutside after the party he meets one of the waitresses , mallory doss ( embeth davidzt ) , just as she realizes her car has been stolen . \ndriven by southern chivalry , a driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress , magruder offers her a ride home . \nthere he learns more about mallory's life than he bargained for . \nher car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon ( robert duvall ) , a ted kyzynski-style whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter . \nmagruder , perhaps influenced by mallory's decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him , is sympathetic to her plight , and offers to help her get her father committed - right after he sleeps with her , of course . \nthis simple offer of help leads magruder down a dangerous path with a black end . \nhe succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in a mental hospital , and for a moment all appears well . \nbut then dixon's crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup - and suddenly magruder finds himself , mallory and his own children in danger . \nthe cops won't lift a finger to help a liberal attorney . \nhis only allies are his faithful assistant lois ( daryl hannah ) and his bumbling private-eye sidekick clyde ( robert downey jr ) . \nif this predicament wasn't bad enough , hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos . \naltman may provide the atmosphere , but branagh's performance holds the gingerbread man together . \nan accomplished actor when he isn't directing himself in vanity productions , branagh does a fine job of making rick a sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives . \nis his offer of help to mallory an act of kindness , or of egotism ? \nmagruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it - and by then it's too late . \nas the plot unfolds , magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are . \nand life is never so bad that it can't get worse . \nif you're familiar with altman's work , you'll recognize several of his signature techniques . \ncharacters are not introduced in establishing shots , but rather are allowed to wander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent . \ncrucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows , making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action . \ndialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style . \nand of course there's my favorite altman technique - the obligatory nude actress shot . \nthanks to altman , here are some of the actresses i've had the pleasure of seeing naked : sally kellerman , julianne moore , madeline stowe , even frances mcdormand . \nand now i can add embeth davidtz , who looks quite healthy in the altogether . \nthe naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film . \nis it old-school sexism , or a clever in-joke ? \nyou be the judge . \nbut back to the picture at hand . \nin the hands of a mere mortal , the gingerbread man would have been a routine thriller , no better or worse than the countless others we've all endured . \nin the hands of a master like altman , it becomes an exercise in existential doom , in its own way far more successful than scorsese's cape fear remake , which tried for the same result . \nwhat may prevent it from enduring with altman's greatest work is a weak third act - in fact , there really is no third act in grisham's story , so it appears that altman had to throw in the hurricane just to jazz things up . \nbut there are true moments of riveting suspense , and great performances by branagh , davidzt and downey jr - more than enough to see you through . \nthat polygram so hated this picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman , and then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back , should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are . \nthey probably wanted it to look more like a time to kill . \nand that , my friends , should make you very afraid . \n", "october sky is a rare oddity in cinema : a self-proclaimed \" uplifting \" film that is actually uplifting ! \nbased on the autobiographical book by homer hickam , rocket boys , october sky tells the struggle of four boys reaching for their dream . \nit's 1957 , and for the boys of coalwood , west virginia , there's not much hope of a rosy future . \ncoalwood is a coal mining town , and , except for the few lucky ones who manage to escape on a football scholarship , most of coalwood's boys are destined to work in the mine . \nbut , in october 1957 , an event happens that sparks one boy to dream . \nthe launch of the soviet satellite sputnik sets homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal ) to dream a future of rocketry and space travel . \nof course , homer's parents ( chris cooper and natalie canderday ) aren't quite sure what to make of their son's unusual interests . \nhomer gets his strongest encouragement from miss riley ( laura dern ) , a teacher in his school who also informs him about the scholarships offered to the winners of a national science fair . \nand so , with stars in his eyes , and thoughts of scholarships in his head , homer enlists the help of three other boys ( william lee scott , chad lindberg and chris owen ) and begins to build a rocket . \nbut , do these four backwoods boys even have the slightest hope of escaping their destiny ? \nthere is a lot that could have gone wrong with october sky . \nnearly every sequence flirts with becoming syrupy and cliched . \nhowever , miraculously , october sky avoids nearly all of these pitfalls , making the exact right moves at the exact right times . \na film emerges which manages to be powerful and moving without slipping into the gauzy haze of nostalgia or sliding down the sugarry slope of sappiness . \njake gyllenhaal is outstanding as the kid at the center of this film . \n>from the outset of the film , he is immediately likable , and never seems too corny or brainy as to alienate the audience . \nunfortunately , while october sky focuses on homer , the other three kids get the short end of the stick . \nthey remain little more than placeholders reading \" insert friend here \" . \nof the adults in the film , chris cooper is the most fully realized character . \nthe film never paints him as merely the villainous parent standing in the way of his child's dreams , but , instead , shows the multihued portrait of a man who wants the best for his family and town , but is too stubborn to realize what that is . \ndirector joe johnson deserves much credit for successfully navigating the many obstacles that october sky manages to dodge . \nhowever , there are still a few occasions when he allows things to proceed just a step too far . \nscenes which were natural and inspiring start to become contrived and artificial . \nhowever , these lapses are minimal , and johnson quickly steers the movie back on course . \nthe problem with many so-called \" uplifting \" films is that they attempt to force their mediciney goodness down your throat . \noctober sky never resorts to that level , and yet , manages to become a truly uplifting film purely on its own merits . \n", "this three hour movie opens up with a view of singer/guitar player/musician/composer frank zappa

predominately male cast . \nboth films follow young men as they illicitly fight the traditional system for their own desires . \nand both films are seen through the eyes of one narrator , who eventually realizes that these men have to be stopped . \nwhile boiler room writer/director ben younger does not get his point across as well as david fincher does for fight club , he does contribute another impressive work to a series of films aiming to represent the new generation . \na generation which has seen the internet prosper and where everyone wants to be a millionaire . \npaying homage to oliver stone's 1987 classic wall street , younger is almost modernizing the tale by using younger , hipper actors to play the greedy villains as opposed to the older , more experienced types . \nas is true in real life , younger minds are becoming richer and richer from their knowledge of more standard technology . \nboiler room dismisses the notion of ingenuity and shows that greed and desire for power come in all ages . \nanother similarity with fight club is that both films are not action flicks . \nsome people are convinced that an all-male cast automatically means there must be gory violence , here is proof that this is not true . \nif you want to see an action movie starring ben affleck , go see reindeer games this weekend . \nif you want to see a smart , insightful film with excellent acting and a clever script , see boiler room . \ngiovanni ribisi gives an outstanding performance as the film's narrator , seth . \nafter dropping out of college and running a lucrative gambling center for college students in his apartment , seth is offered a high paying job by a wealthy man ( nicky katt ) . \nhe agrees to take the job ( in which you are guaranteed to become a millionaire within three years ) of selling stock to well-off americans from the mid-west over the telephone and begins to fit in quite well with his co-workers . \nlearning tricky techniques to deceive innocent people into buying shares of a good in production , seth figures this is too good to be true . \nafter stumbling into a room at the wrong time , he knows there is something no good about this company . \nat this point , seth is left with the ultimate choice ; continue with the american dream and make millions or tell the authorities that something fishy is going on . \nribisi is believable as seth especially when he shares scenes with ron rifkin , playing seth's dad . \nthe two have perfect chemistry as a troubled father and son trying to impress each other and simultaneously impress themselves . \nthe transitions from anger to sympathy that these scenes contain are the standout segments of the entire film . \nthe supporting cast of greedy co-workers is also flawless . \nben affleck shines in a short but sweet performance as a recruiter for the company , nicky katt is fabulous as the ostensibly friendly boss who eventually becomes extremely jealous of seth , and vin diesel gives his best performance of his career as the foil character of nicky katt . \nthe energy of the cast as a whole makes boiler room well paced and never boring . \nthe only major error in the film is that nothing major happens . \nthere is no big plot twist or climatic point to make the film more memorable . \ndue to the lack of a major event , boiler room never finds a suitable genre to fit into . \nthe movie is not intense enough to be a thriller , the romantic segments involving seth and abby ( nia long ) are not properly finalized , and the dialogue isn't funny enough to make it a comedy . \nin having trouble to characterize the movie as a whole , boiler room is slightly confused at times . \nit doesn't seem to know which category to fit itself into . \none satisfying concluding scene could have changed the whole film for the better . \notherwise , the movie is fun to watch thanks to its lively cast of young actors . \n", "ok , let's get one thing straight right away : maximum risk is no battleship potemkin ( although it does have some russians in it ! ) , but it's not too bad , really . \nit's the new film from ringo lam , the latest hong kong filmmaker to defect to hollywood , and stars that minor league schwartzeneggar from belgium , jean-claude van damme ( who , you will recall , also starred in john woo's maiden hollywood effort , hard target ) . \nin lam's film , van damme plays alain moreau , a french cop ( at least his accent makes more sense here than it did in hard target ) who discovers that he was separated shortly after birth from a twin brother who was adopted by russians . \nthese russians defected to the united states and moved into a black neighbourhood in new york ( where , i suppose , they thought they wouldn't be noticed ) . \nthis brother , mikhail suverov ( played in his few scenes by . . . well , \nyou know ) , becomes deeply involved in the russian mafia and the fbi ( almost the same thing , i guess ) , and is killed in france ( in the movie , things happen so fast that you don't have too much time to think about how weird this all is ) . \nmoreau does what any good surviving twin brother would do and goes to new york to find out why mikhail was killed , and why everyone in france who knows anything about him is also being killed ( we wonder the same thing ; i still do ) . \nin little odessa , he meets mikhail's girlfriend , alex ( natasha henstridge , last seen in species ) , who helps him solve the mystery and adds immeasurably to the mise-en-scene ( she has very nice breasts , and we get to seen them briefly in this movie ; it was rated r in the us but is pg here , so they must have seen more of her breasts than we do ) . \nthis film lacks the gloss and high production values of such other action movies as broken arrow , the fugitive , hard target , or anything starring arnold , but that works to its benefit , i think . \nafter all , one thing that's been missing from woo's hollywood films is that certain hong kong funkiness that we all know and love ( well , some of us do ) . \nmovies like this shouldn't be too pretentious , and that is part of the problem with some of these other films : they try to be too \" big \" in terms of special effects and sheer spectacle . \nmaximum risk has its share of car chases and explosions , but they don't overwhelm the movie or detract our attention from the narrative ( not too much , anyway ) . \nthe emphasis throughout is on the characters and their interactions ( even if , at times , they don't make a hell of a lot of sense ) . \nin fact , one of the more interesting aspects of the film is a minor character , a rather overeager new york cabbie ( frank van keeken from tv's \" kids in the hall \" ) , who begins as something of a joke but becomes an important part of the story . \nunfortunately , by the time we have come to really get interested in him , he . . . well , \nyou'll see . \nthe movie also features some set pieces of the type that we have come to expect from lam and his hong kong compatriots . \none is a fight in a russian sauna , with lots of sweaty , muscular male flesh ( this one will appeal to certain parts of the audience more than others ) , bullets in heads , and vodka . \nanother , my personal favorite , is a fight in a meat packing house , featuring pig carcasses and a chainsaw . \nand even the predictable car chases are more hong kong than hollywood , as they trash those quaint french cafes , vegetable carts , and , well , french people that , we all know in our hearts , deserve trashing just for being so damn quaint . \nof course , the movie does have its share of silliness . \nfor example , while beating the crap out of an obnoxious russian thug who obviously deserves what he's getting , alain stops long enough to look at his own reflection in the cracked mirror with which he has been whacking the guy on the head . \nin an unnecessarily dramatic moment , he apparently is shocked at what he sees , at what he has become . \nbut what has he become ? \na tough cop who beats the hell out of a guy who tried to kill him ? \ndoesn't sound too unreasonable to me , considering the genre . \nbut let's face it , any time van damme tries to be dramatic , he looks silly . \nso maximum risk is a little different from most other action films . \nwhile watching it , i was surprised , and a little disappointed , in the relative lack of pyrotechnics . \nbut watching some of these other action films is sort of like experiencing a sugar rush ; after the initial excitement , there's not much left . \nalthough it's short on spectacle , lam's film leaves a better and more lasting impression , i think . \ni'm more impressed by it now than i was while watching it , and to me , that's a good sign . \ngo see maximum risk , but don't expect a typical hollywood action movie ; expect a sort of funky hong kong-hollywood action movie . \nthe flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . \n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \n * * * * * perfection . \nsee it twice . \ndr t . white teaches film at the english language and literature department of the national university of singapore , but we don't hold this against him . \n", "trailing the success of brit humour in the movie industry with the likes of the semi-dramatic the commitments and the nearly slapstick a fish called wanda , the full monty is one film which delivered the depth of the former and the humour magnitude of the latter . \nthe film opens with a narrated documentary reel showing the improving economic and living standards of sheffield in the 60's , then cut to the harsh reality of the present . \nsheffield has become some sort of a semi-slum with the only visible increase in anything was the amount of layoffs from steel-factories ; a once flourishing industry . \ngaz ( carlyle ) spends most of his time in the worker's club , a sort of place where jobless people sit around to wait for job offers . \nhe and his `plump' friend dave ( addy ) as well as their former foreman gerald ( wilkinson ) have been sitting around the club for months without any `call for duty' . \nwhat seemingly was just a passing hard time for gaz suddenly transformed itself into desperation when he cannot afford the 700 pounds of child-support money to his ex-wife . \nsuddenly finding himself facing the possiblity of losing custody of his son , he goes on to concoct an enterprising wild-idea to get the money he desperately requires . \ndave and gerald too have problems of their own . \non top of his lack of employment , dave is also faced with the paranoia of his wife leaving him because of his current financial state as well as his`plump' appearance while gerald have been cheating on his wife by not telling her of his layoff for as long as 6 months , leaving home for `work' when he was actually a long-standing member of the worker's club . \nthere we have it ; people with real problems and a not-so-practical solution for them . \ngaz manages to get the support from them and sure enough they managed to get a few other poor jobless blokes to join in their gag : to perform a strip-act at the local pub . \nin gaz's own words while looking at an add for a strip-act featuring hunky `beautiful' men , `if women are willing to pay for this , they sure as well will pay for real-men' . \nthe full monty is very simple in nature and not a trace ambitious at all . \nit is a small film which delves in the harsh-reality of unemployment and the desperation it drives people to . \nit also is a very light movie to watch despite the theme it delves in because it has a lot of human-factor going for it . \nnever for once , was it trying to be manipulative at all , the full monty was true to itself all the way . \nwhile the hilarity level of this film soared unexpectedly high , audience will find that they are in no way being cheated of a laugh , something lacking in many comedy films ( wannabes ? ) from hollywood . \nother than carlyle , who acted as the psychotic begbie in trainspotting , the rest of the actors were definitely very new to me on-screen . \nhowever , the acting presented in this film is more than satisfying . \ncarlyle's work here is a stark contrast to his character in trainspotting , implying real acting skill and flexibility on-screen . \nkudos to the people involved in this film , especially to director peter cattaneo for being able to put together an excellent film which is has so much potential in ending up as your just-another-striptease . \nalready a critical and financial success for such a small film , the full monty is a humble film which deserves applause throughout . \nwhile titanic managed to feast the eyes and soul in an epic way , the full monty gives one the same satisfaction ? ? . in \nhalf the time . \n", " \" you'll go ape over tarzan because it's more fun than a barrel of monkeys ! \" \nokay , there's the quote in case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie . \ndisney's latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning , skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a sinking ship . \nfather , mother , and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins , and have soon built a treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson . \nit's amazing , the kinds of things you can do when you work to a soundtrack . \nbefore you know it , an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands of kala ( glenn close ) , a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard . \nagainst the wishes of her mate and family leader , kerchak ( lance henricksen ) , she takes on the infant boy as her own . \ntarzan is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild . \nmuch of tarzan's young life is spent trying to become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his \" father , \" which occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how well-meant his attempts . \nall he's looking for is acceptance , perhaps a goal easily identifiable by young viewers , but one which will ring true with a lot of adults . \nwhen you really think about it , this story fits right into the disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end . \nlook back on past disney animated features and you'll see the trend . \ngrowing up , tarzan ( voiced by alex d . linz as a child , and by tony goldwyn as an adult ) has a couple of friends . \none is an ape named terk ( rosie o'donnell ) , and the other is a paranoid hypochondriac of an elephant named tantor ( wayne knight ) . \nboth provide the requisite comic relief ( timon and poombah from the lion king immediately come to mind ) and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the disney mold . \ni'm beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one of these films . \njust fill in the blanks ! \ncan you see it ? \n \" now we have to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief , but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it . \nwe've already had a fish and a crab , and we've had a candle and a teapot , a genie and a dog , a few stone statues . . . . have \nwe had an ape and an elephant yet ? \nwell , there we go ! \" \nof course , there's gotta be romance somewhere along the line , so jane ( minnie driver ) gets introduced about halfway through . \ntogether with her father dr . porter ( nigel hawthorne ) and the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , jane is on an expedition to find and study the wild gorillas of africa . \nshe discovers the man raised by apes and is enchanted almost immediately , and soon shares an amusing version of the compulsory \" you tarzan , me jane \" scene . \nthankfully , those aren't the exact words . \nhowever , i found it distracting that tarzan is going \" ohh ohh ee ee \" one second and then tells jane his name in this manly voice with perfect diction . \nhow does he tell his name to another ape ? \n \" ohh ohh ee - tarzan - ee ee ohh ? \" \nwell , regardless of my picky nature , the romance actually works as only disney romance can : purely contrived , but for some reason rather believable . \nbut hey , tarzan's a young adult . \ndo you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane ? \nisn't that illegal in most countries ? \noh , well . \ni don't think disney will be using my quote anymore . \ntarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not a musical . \nthere's lots of music to be sure , but not a single character song in the whole hour and a half of running time . \nwe instead get more of a phil collins concert , as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material . \nthis isn't really a bad thing , as the songs are very high-energy and catchy ( i found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day ) ; it's just different . \ndo yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system , because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie . \nwith each new feature , disney animation gets even better . \nnot necessarily by leaps and bounds , but since they put out a new film each year , a steady rate of improvement is apparent , and this definitely shows in tarzan . \nthere are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near 3-d effect , and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying . \nthe way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers , and had me thinking this isn't just tarzan , it's \" extreme tarzan . \" \nhowever , tarzan does not seem to have what i call its \" chandelier scene , \" which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort , utilizing a computer-assisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking . \nlasting but a few seconds at most , it's been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast , in which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail . \nas usual , the voice talent is up to snuff , convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters . \nthe one poor choice in casting , however , was rosie o'donnell . \ngoing into the film , i didn't know she was even a part of it , but when terk started talking , i recognized her voice immediately . \nher performance was fine , but through the rest of the film i kept thinking , \" that's no boy ape , that rosie o'donnell . \" \ndistracting to say the least . \ni'll admit i've never read the edgar rice burroughs story \" tarzan of the apes , \" so i couldn't tell you how true this film stays to the book . \nbut unless you're a purist , you should have few objections to this film . \nwith solid performances , action , adventure , a bit of romance , and great music and animation , tarzan should appeal to the kids and to the kid in all of us . \nnote : when i wrote my review of mulan a year ago , i went off on the promotional and merchandising tie-ins prevalent with the release of a disney animated feature . \nthis time , i'll just say that i went to mcdonald's yesterday to treat myself to a mcflurry , and tarzan was on the cup . \n'nuff said . \n", "you've got mail is a timely romance for this impersonal , computer-driven decade . \ntwo people who've never met confide in each other via e-mail without revealing their true identities . \nnora ephron's contemporary update of the shop around the corner retains the basic plot : two people who despise each other unwittingly become enamored with each other through their anonymous correspondence . \nephron , who co-wrote the film with her sister , delia , as well as directed it , knew what she was doing by reteaming tom hanks and meg ryan as the at-odds couple . \nryan is kathleen kelly , owner of a small children's bookstore , while hanks is joe fox , who heads up a chain of mega bookstores ( think barnes & noble ) . \ntheir charm and chemistry are the glue that binds this film , even through some of the script's rough spots . \nfor the ephrons invested so much effort in their protagonists that they give short shrift to the talented supporting cast , including parker posey , greg kinnear , jean stapleton and steve zahn . \nyet no one is really going to complain because the ephrons know their audience - and what the paying public wants is hanks and ryan . \nand the two are kept busy . \none , the other or both are in

soundtrack adds to this date-night special . \noverall , you've got mail is a lush and cute outing , taking advantage of the star appeal of its two leads . \nit's a nice holiday movie , one for holding hands and snuggling . \ncommitted to lifelong learning through effective communication \n", "according to hollywood movies made in last few decades , life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to a human being . \neven worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark , god-forsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience . \non the other hand , it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america , because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view . \nthis film is amarcord , 1974 comedy by famous italian director federico fellini , which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages , and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life . \nthe film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense . \ninstead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs , as well as series of local , often very colourful characters . \nalthough many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator , movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist , 14-year old boy titta ( played by bruno zanin ) and chronicles his sexual frustrations , obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca ( played by magali noel ) , problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family , as well as troubles his father ( played by armando brancia ) have with mussolini's fascist regime . \namarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film , and it probably explains why it is very popular , even among those people who actually don't like federico fellini's work very much . \nevery member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film , because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible . \ndistortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film - word \" amarcord \" is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase \" i remember \" in local italian dialect . \nin the same way the word is distorted , so is the past in memories of those who remember it . \nafter the premiere , fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film , but it doesn't matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellini's childhood or not ; any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film . \nfellini's views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film . \neven the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images . \ncharacters look like caricatures , actors playing them often deliberately overact , and women , especially those who fuel titta's sexual fantasies , often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions . \nevery now and then , scenes that depict 1930s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movie's characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters' visions . \nbecause of that , almost everything in this film looks different , and in most cases better , than it would have looked in the real life . \neven the fascism gets fellinian make-over - fellini views mussolini's totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle ( explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history ) and opportunity for comedy . \nwhen fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents , even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour . \nunlike many of his italian colleagues in 1970s , who had used 1930s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda , fellini doesn't care that much about politics . \nlack of self-righteous moral perspective is compensated with fellini's humanistic approach to his characters . \neach of them , regardless of age , gender , social class or physical appearance , is given opportunity to express his or her views , dreams and fears . \nfellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection , even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people . \nbecause of this warmth and democratic spirit , amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of 20th century , and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable , melancholic and even tragic moments . \nfellini couldn't produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie . \nvignettes aren't memorable because of the characters only ; fellini uses camera , painting film in bright colours , especially in the scenes that depict character's fantasies . \nfellini also knows how to use locations , whether such location happens to be luxurious hotel , bright-coloured beach or rural countryside . \neven the down-to-earth streets of rimini , where everyone knows everyone , gets magical dimension during the snowfall . \non the other hand , lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene . \nthis atmosphere is also provided by incredible talent of composer and fellini's long-time associate nino rota . \nhis amarcord theme is probably one of the most recognisable , most popular and most relaxing and uplifting pieces of film music ever produced . \nthat music alone should be the reason to view amarcord as one of the indisputable classics of seventh art . \n", "written by mark rosenthal and

un-creative movie . \nbut , as a vetern , i can say quite honestly that creativity doesn't count for as much as it should . \nso that saves mighty joe from my wrath , although my colleagues and cohorts and surely bashing this film at this very moment . \nthis is not the film to take a girl on a date to . \nit's not the film for you . \nit's the film for you and your family . \nwhen you're right alongside your kid , all of the normal rights and wrongs slip away . \nthe same thing happens when you watch a horror movie or an action flick . \nit becomes fun . \nall you have to do to enjoy mighty joe young is shut up and watch . \n", "notting hill's trailer is awful : a laughless , schmaltzy montage . \nthe movie was desperately marketed to the anti-phantom menace crowd , the same lovelorn females who ignored the love letter . \nand it apparently worked . \nperhaps the presence of julia roberts-whose allure beyond those perfect teeth still escapes me-had a lot to do with notting hill's opening weekend success , but the film's staying power is based on word of mouth . \nallow me to spread some more good buzz for notting hill . \ngrant stars as william thacker , a travel-bookstore owner who works and resides in a tiny english district called notting hill . \ninto his shop one day wanders famous actress anna scott ( roberts ) . \na common thief , some spilled orange juice , and some stilted conversation leads to their first , highly impetuous ( or is that improbable ? ) , kiss . \ndays later , william sneaks into her hotel suite under the guise of a magazine journalist , and so begins a passionate , albeit surreptitious , affair . \n ( aside : notting hill's portrayal of press junkets is deadly accurate . ) \nonly anna's celebrity-or william's lack thereof-threatens to drive a wedge between them . \nrichard curtis has tapped into fantasy we all have considered , and for at least its first half-hour the picture's \" beauty and the beast \" -like scenario is ( romantic ) escapism of the highest order . \nas with groundhog day or pleasantville , while watching the high-concept comedy notting hill one constantly imagines him/herself in the lead ; it's william's ordinaryness that entices the spoiled and bored anna . \ncurtis ( who previously penned four weddings and a funeral ) is also smart enough to know that the unlikely couple's situation is not enough to fuel two hours' worth of entertainment , so some of notting hill's finest moments revolve around william's eccentric friends and family . \nby now , dear reader , you've probably heard a lot about rhys ifans' performance as william's imbecilic welsh flatmate . \nyes , he's a crowd pleaser , a walking sight gag , but his character is not nearly as involving as the wheelchair-bound ( and appropriately named ) bella ( mckee , the anguished waitress of naked ) or max ( tom mcinnerny ) , her lousy chef of a husband . \nin the movie's best sequence , william , anna , and company sit around bloated from max's latest concoction and hold a contest : the last brownie on the table goes to the diner with the saddest life . \nthe scene ends only as a british writer would end it . \nif anything , fantastic bits like these dull the main plot's dramatic impact . \nroberts and grant , especially , are appealing , but their relationship is convolutedly interrupted too many times ( four weddings' suffered similar flaws ) , and william and anna ultimately only have one thing in common : they're lonely . \n ( worth noting in roberts' and grant's favour : the ubiquitous \" i'm just a girl , standing across from a boy , asking him to love her \" episode is not nearly so syrupy as it appears in clips , and it features some of the best emoting either actor has ever done . ) \nnotting hill is nonetheless enjoyable ; on the visual side of things , i especially appreciated michell's playful changing-of-the-seasons number . \nif only ( and this is a surprisinly minor gripe ) he had lopped off the egregious epilogue ; for a story that thrives on what we bring to it , the filmmakers work too hard to tidy things up , leaving our imaginations in the lurch . \n", "[note that followups are directed to rec . arts . movies . current-films and rec . arts . movies . startrek . current \nonly , not to rec . arts . sf . movies . \n-moderator] \nstar trek : first contact a film review by michael dequina copyright 1996 michael dequina \nstar trek : first contact ( pg-13 ) anyone familiar with the series of star trek movies knows of the \" even-odd pattern \" --the even-numbered installments of the series are good while the odd-numbered ones are , well , not-so-good . \nthe pattern continues with the new star trek : first contact , an energetic sci-fi adventure that ( coincidentally ? ) is the eighth entry in the hugely popular series . \nin this first trek feature to feature only cast members from the late star trek : the next generation television series , captain jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the rest of the 24th-century crew of the starship enterprise--commander will riker ( jonathan frakes , who also directed ) , android lt . cmdr . \ndata ( brent spiner ) , lt . cmdr . \ngeordi laforge ( levar burton ) , lt . cmdr . \nworf ( michael dorn ) , dr . beverly crusher ( gates mcfadden ) , and counselor deanna troi ( marina sirtis ) --travel back to 21st-century earth while doing battle with the borg , a race of cybernetic beings that share a collective mind with the borg queen ( alice krige ) . \nthe borg intend to alter history and assimilate all of humankind into their race--starting with the earth-orbiting crew of the enterprise and a 21st century stowaway ( alfre woodard ) . \nthis is an interesting plotline that is sure to mesmerize trekkers everywhere and engage everyone else , but , unfortunately , it only makes up the star trek half of the script by brannon braga and ronald d . moore . \nthe other half of the title--first contact--refers to a subplot that takes place on 21st-century earth , where riker , troi , and laforge meet legendary scientist zephram cochran ( james cromwell ) , who is about to embark on the first warp speed flight in human history , which directly leads to the first contact with extraterrestrials . \nwhile this story does tie into the main plot and pays off interestingly in the end , it is nowhere near as involving or exciting as the borg battles on the enterprise . \nnot helping matters is the tiresome cochran character , an eccentric whose drunken schtick starts out funny but becomes too one-note after a while . \nin the end , though , the first contact subplot doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the film as a whole . \nthe story is typical sci-fi fantasy , but the conviction of the cast--most notably the always-phenomenal stewart--makes you believe and care . \nfrakes , making his feature directorial debut , keeps the action swiftly rolling along and delivers the action goods , even upping the violence a notch ( this is the first trek film to bear a pg-13 rating ) to greater effect . \nst : fc has a bigger budget than the last trek outing , the middling star trek generations , and it definitely shows on screen--the production design and especially visual and makeup effects are outstanding ( in particular those involving the borg queen ) . \nbraga and moore's mostly sharp script will please both trek devotees and the rest ; the references to the borg storyline in the tv series , the continuity with the previous film ( e . g . \nthe ongoing saga of data's emotion chip ) , and a fleeting star trek : voyager crossover will make trekkers squeal with delight , but such points are made easily accessible to those less familiar to the trek mythos . \nparamount was reportedly worried about the staying power of its trek franchise with the next generation cast now carrying the helm . \nbased on the entertaining success that is star trek : first contact , i'd say the studio has nothing to worry about ( at least not until this cast retires and the crew of the wan star trek : deep space nine takes over . . . ) . \n", "slavery is bad . \nafter hundreds of years , we've finally figured that one out . \nthis almost universal belief is the both the strength and weakness of director steven spielberg's latest \" serious \" film . \nduring the late 1830s , a portuguese slave ship carries a cargo of black men and women kidnapped from their home on africa's west coast to cuba to be sold into slavery . \nfifty-three of them are stuffed into the \" la amistad \" ( from a spanish word for \" friendship \" ) by their new spanish owners . \nfreeing himself from his chains , senge pieh ( djimon hounsou ) , renamed cinque by his masters , leads a bloody revolt . \nafter killing most of the crew , the africans force the remaining sailors to return them to their home - or so they think . \ninstead the ship heads up the coast to the united states . \nthe amistad is boarded by an american naval ship and the revolutionaries are put on trial in connecticut for murder and piracy . \nthe legal question becomes are they free men fighting justly for their freedom or are they property . \nif they are property , who do they belong to ? \ntheir masters ? \nthe spanish government ? \nsalvage rights of the officers who captured the ship ? \nthe us government ? \nthe defendants are pawns in several games . \nabolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) want to free them , but tappan sees them primarily as a means to further the cause . \ntheir lawyer roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) views the case as a simple one of property rights and a chance to make his share of legal fees . \nsouth carolina senator john c . calhoun ( arliss howard ) pursues the case for the political advancement of the southern states . \npresident martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) is willing to force the result towards his own political ends . \nwhen the verdict looks to free the africans , van buren replaces the judge with one more sympathetic to his wishes . \neven that doesn't work and the new judge frees the kidnap victims . \nat the urging of calhoun , the president then appeals the case to the supreme court , populated by a majority of slave-owners . \nthis little-known ( try finding it in any history text book ) incident from america's past would have gone down a darker path were it not for former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) who is persuaded to argue the case before the supreme court . \nthe slavery issue is easy pickin's for spielberg . \nmuch like his \" shindler's list \" ( which followed \" jurassic park \" as this follows \" lost world \" ) , the moral sides are not difficult ones to choose . \nnazis and slave traders : both treat groups of others as less than human . \nit's not hard to see who the bad guys are . \nwithout that question to ponder , the director's job is more difficult . \nhe has to make the story interesting . \nspielberg succeeds for the most part . \nthe visual aspect of the film is beyond reproach . \nwhere the movie falls down is a bit more subtle . \nthere are very few _people_ in the tale . \nin fact , cinque is the only character who is fleshed out . \ntappan and joadson are \" abolitionists \" : symbols but not humans . \nvan buren is a weak politician but nothing else . \nthe rest of the \" slaves \" barely exist other than dressing for the set . \nlike many other films about people of color , almost all the major players are white . \nthe film's salvation lies in the acting strength of everyone involved and the powerful presence of hounsou . \nthe former model's first major role is a winner . \nwithout speaking more than five words of english , he conveys more emotion than most actors with a thousand lines of dialog . \nthe other stand-out is hopkins who seems to be making a career out of portraying american presidents ( he also played the title role in \" nixon \" ) . \nthe impassioned speech by the doddering old man who phases in and out of rationality is among the best court-room drama ever on the screen . \nthere are some other great moments . \nespecially impressive are the african's struggle to understand what is going on in the strange land . \ntheir interpretation of the bible based solely on the pictures and their own experiences is poignant . \nas grand as the epic is , it would have more impact had it focused more on the experience from the point of view of the africans . \nmore humanity in the fight for humanity would have made it a four-star film . \n ( michael redman has written this column for a real long time and is just now getting around to seeing some 1998 films . ) \n", "reflecting on \" bedazzled , \" a lively comedy about the devil who seeks to possess the soul of a pathetic loser , one sinful thought remains in my mind . \nif hell means having to spend an eternity with elizabeth hurley ( who portrays the fiery demon ) , then use that pitchfork and point me the way . \nwith her pouty lips , irresistible british accent , and wild display of haute couture , hurley crackles with naughtiness and fills your mind with temptation . \nit's practically impossible to turn this beelzu-babe down . \nher next target is elliot ( brendan fraser ) , a tech support geek who is clumsy , awkward , and just too eager to please . \nto aptly picture him , you would have to remember a saturday night live skit featuring \" steve the copy guy \" who effortlessly irritated his co-workers with his unpolished social skills . \neugene , thus , is loathed and feared by his co-workers , who do their best to stay out of his way . \nyet , beyond his annoying mannerisms , he's a lovable oaf . \nhe wishes that he could get closer to allison ( frances o'connor ) , a co-worker with whom he is infatuated but who has never taken notice of him . \nhowever , the odds of him getting together with her are about the same as a snowball's chance in hell . \n \" dear god , \" he prays . \n \" i would give anything to have that girl in my life . \" \nguess who then shows up ? \nshe makes an offer that is too hard to refuse . \n \" seven utterly fabulous wishes for one piddling little soul . \" \nthere's even an escape clause . \nif elliot's wish doesn't go exactly the way he likes , he need only 'beep' her ( one guess as to what the three-digit number is ) and he gets to start over . \nthe remainder of the film consists of elliot's various fantasies that incorporate his personal desire to have enormous amounts of wealth , power , fame and allison's love . \nbut when he makes sweeping statements such as \" i want to be very , very powerful and very , very rich and married to allison \" , he'll soon learn that the devil is in the details . \nfor example , ( and we've seen this several times in the trailers ) , he is granted his wish , but finds out that he's a columbian drug lord and that allison , while married to him , has her eyes on someone else . \napparently , the devil is just as eager to skew his fantasies as she is to possess his soul . \nhis other wishes also end up with some strange but funny twist that short-circuits his new life . \nsoon , elliot wishes that he had never made that deal . \ngiven the mischievous nature of the devil , \" bedazzled \" has many amusing moments . \na lot of the credit goes to fraser who turns in a great comic performance . \nhe ably assumes various personas . \nhis funniest segment is when he wishes that he could be the most sensitive man in the world . \nallison becomes so frustrated with him that she practically urges him to take advantage of her . \nhurley also heightens the humor quotient , especially in the transitional scenes when fraser waits to start his next wish after bailing out of the previous one . \nit's clear that she's having a good time with it all . \nyet , while the filmmakers work hard at creating funny scenes , they conspicuously avoid developing the allegorical underpinnings between good and evil that could have added more heft to this story . \nbut that would be playing with fire . \nwhat they've got works , so you can easily accept it for the pleasant little comedy that it is . \n", "the muppet movie is the first , and the best movie among the ever-growing list of muppet movies . \nthe muppet movie tells the story of how our hero , kermit the frog , came to be a star . \na delightful movie for all ages , the muppet movie is * bursting * with cameo appearances by countless hollywood stars of the 80's and today . \nthe muppet movie begins in a movie theater , where all of the muppet stars are anxiously awaiting the first showing . \nonce everyone is settled down , the movie inside of the movie begins . \nit starts out with kermit in a swamp , playing his banjo and singing ( this shot required jim henson to spend hours underwater ) . \nkermit is discovered by bernie , a big-time hollywood agent who happens upon kermit by accident . \nbernie believes that kermit holds much potential to become a big star in hollywood . \nkermit ponders the idea of becoming a big movie star , where he could \" make millions of people happy \" . \nkermit decides to leave his swamp and make the trip out to hollywood . \nalong the way , kermit befriends his now famous muppet companions , beginning with fozzie bear , who had been spending his days doing stand-up comedy at the el sleezo cafe , owned by james coburn . \nthe two decide to team-up and continue on their way to hollywood . \nbut , doc hopper ( charles durning ) , the owner of a chain of french fried frog leg restaurants has a different idea . \nhe wants kermit to be his spokesman , but kermit is humiliated at the idea and spends the movie avoiding him and his assistants . \nthe trip continues , with kermit and fozzie meeting miss piggy , rowlf , gonzo , the electric mayhem band , and more muppets who all share the same wish : to make it to hollywood . \noh , and even more celebrities continue to appear . \nkermit and miss piggy continue to

kermit is finally able to elude doc hopper and proclaim his freedom . \nlord lew , a big-time hollywood producer portrayed by orson welles , gives kermit his shot at stardom and gives him the go-ahead to produce a movie . \nthe muppet movie is definitely a movie that is fun for all ages . \nit is also a sure-deal as one parents can watch , and enjoy along with their kids . \n", "all great things come to an end , and the dot-com era embodies that perfectly . \nbeneath a mound of bankruptcy paperwork lies the remains of a former dot-com darling , the company kozmo . com , \nan online convenience store stocked with ice cream , porn videos , and other basic necessities of a urban dweller , all hand-delivered by couriers within an hour . \ndesigned in 1997 by two college roommates -- joseph parks , a 27 year old goldman sachs banker , and yong kang - kozmo flamed out in three short years , raising more than $280 million in venture capital funding and from partnerships with such bigwigs as starbucks and amazon . com . \nby december 1999 , the company boasted 4 , 000 employees in 11 cities , its barking ceo park attracting all kinds of media attention . \nthe company was set for an ipo in may 2000 . . . \nuntil april 14 , 2000 , the day the stock market took its first big dive , ending the internet era . \nby april 13 , 2001 , kozmo was out of money and ceased operations . \nunlike the earlier , similar documentary startup . com , which chronicled the rise and fall of another dot-com , govworks , e-dreams focuses both on its original founders , especially park , and on the common folks that ran the day-to-day operations . \nthe contrast is amazing , showing how a cult persona can convince anyone that any idea is the next big thing . \nthe film's director , wonsuk chin ( too tired to die ) , expertly juxtaposes upper management company meetings with on-the-spot interviews with the bike messengers , general managers , and floor staff that kept kozmo humming . \nthe film's images give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise . \nthe most satisfying part of the film comes in understanding , to a degree , the expectations of numerous ceos commanding these titanic-type businesses . \nin the film's final interviews with park , we learn what happens when the money dries up and backers don't return phone calls . \nin the end , the name of the game was profit , and if you couldn't make money , even the dreamers got the axe . \nscreened at the 24th annual mill valley film festival . \n", "since their film debut in 1984 with the tightly wrought texas thriller \" blood simple , \" joel and ethan coen have been one of the most eclectic , original , and downright fascinating creative teams in modern hollywood . \ntheir films are highly stylized , deeply embedded in a particular time and place , and their characters are more often than not everyday people who get caught up in highly unusual circumstances . \nin \" the big lebowski , \" their first cinematic offering since the multiple academy award-winning \" fargo , \" the action takes place in los angeles during the gulf war , and the hero of the story is jeff lebowski , aka the dude . \nthe dude is played by jeff bridges -- one of hollywood's most underrated actors -- in the best stoned performance since sean penn stumbled through the halls of ridgemont high . \nthe dude is a simple man who has never quite made it out of the sixties . \nhe has shaggy , shoulder-length hair , a grizzled goatee badly in need of a trim , and he wears mostly stained tee-shirts , long shorts , and gellies without socks . \nhe smokes a lot of pot , drinks a lot of white russians , and is more than content to spend the majority of his time bowling with his two buddies , a slightly psychotic vietnam vet named walter sobchak ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) , one of those guys who always wants to be part of the conversation , but never quite makes it in . \none day , the dude is confused with another jeff lebowski ( david huddleston ) , this one being a millionaire philanthropist whose trophy wife , bunny ( tara reid ) , owes a lot of people a lot of money . \nthe main plot and all its accompanying side-plots and coenesque diatribes are far too complicated to get into here . \nsuffice to say that the dude becomes deeply involved with the big lebowski when bunny is kidnaped and the dude is asked to be a courier for the ransom money . \nby the time all is said and done , walter has become deeply involved , as has the big lebowski's daughter , maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist performance artist , a pornographer named jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) , and a group of german nihilists led by peter stormare , who was so great as the silent but deadly kidnaper in \" fargo . \" \n \" the big lebowski \" plays like an amalgam of all the coen brothers' earlier efforts . \nit shares their previous films' strong sense of time and place , as well as their send-ups of movie genres and political and cultural ideologies . \n \" lebowski \" has the same kind of crazed caricatures that made \" raising arizona \" such a hoot ; it has surrealistic dream sequences ( one of which involves a busby berkley-like dance number ) that characterized the ending of \" barton fink \" ; and it has the same kind of cartoonish look and feel that pervaded \" the hudsucker proxy . \" \nthe film was shot by veteran cinematographer roger deakins , who has worked with the coens on three other films , \" barton fink , \" \" the hudsucker proxy , \" and \" fargo . \" \ndeakins always gives the coens' films a distinctive visual style , and here he does a brilliant job of capturing the bright colors of seedy los angeles in the early nineties , whether that by the obnoxious blue bowling suit worn by the dude's main competitor jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , or the strikingly manic dream sequences , one of which involves the dizzy spectacle of watching a strike from a bowling ball's point of view . \nif \" fargo \" was the coen brothers' most restrained effort in years , \" the big lebowski \" marks their return to over-the-edge filmmaking . \nit is overflowing with style and attitude , which helps make up for the scattered plot fragments that never quite come together in the end . \nthe coens fill the screen with lighting , set design , music , and hilarious performances from all the leads , especially bridges and the always reliable john goodman , who shows real comic timing in his untimely 'nam-inspired outbursts and his intense dedication to his adopted judaism . \nwith joel directing , ethan producing , and both writing , the coen brothers seem limitless in their capacity to turn our world inside out . \ntheir talent lies not in their ability to reflect the norms of reality , but in their potential to dig out the darkest corners of life and bring them to light . \nthe coens rejoice in the oddballs of the world , and they put them center-stage to show that it's not just guys like the dude who are nuts , but the entire planet . \n", "lean , mean , escapist thrillers are a tough product to come by . \nmost are unnecessarily complicated , and others have no sense of expediency -- the thrill-ride effect gets lost in the cumbersome plot . \nperhaps the ultimate escapist thriller was the fugitive , which featured none of the flash-bang effects of today's market but rather a bread-and-butter , textbook example of what a clever script and good direction is all about . \nthe latest tony scott movie , enemy of the state , doesn't make it to that level . \nit's a true nineties product that runs like greased lightning through a maze of cell phones and laptop computers , without looking back . \nalthough director scott has made missteps in the past , such as the lame thriller the fan , he's generated a good deal of energy in pictures like crimson tide and top gun . \nthat vibrant spirit is present here , shown in well-timed and carefully planned chase scenes that give the movie an aura of sheer speed . \nenemy of the state also features an unprecedented use of amazing cinematography -- director of photography daniel mindel throws a staggering amount of different views , angles , lenses , and film stocks at the audience that goes a long way toward involving the audience in the movie . \nenemy is truly a visual experience , and that's only one of the reasons it's such a fun watch . \nthe movie lights up with an aging senator visited by nsa deputy chief thomas reynolds ( jon voight ) . \nreynolds wants a new communications act passed to allow the government free reign in the use of surveilance equipment , but the senator plans to bury the bill in committee . \nreynolds has the senator offed , but not before the murder is caught on a naturalist's camera . \nby an extremist chain of events , the tape ends up in labor lawyer robert dean ( will smith ) 's posession , and it's not long before he's running from reynolds' cronies . \nit's only with the help of an ex-spook named brill ( gene hackman ) that dean is able to get to the bottom of things . \nthe acting is top notch , and the three principles - smith , hackman , and voight - are generally more mature and excellent all around . \nsmith puts aside the wisecracking act and becomes a normal human being ; voight tones down the amount of sneer he puts into his character for greater ominpotence ; and hackman is simply over the top in the mysterioso role . \nsmith's regular joe comes off particularly well , as he runs from authorties for reasons that he knows not . \nthe supports are also in fine form , lending credibility to the main roles and advancing the plot in key areas . \nthis is , for the holiday crowd , the hot ticket ; as well as anyone looking for a serving of genuine action in a market that is otherwise lacking . \n", "this film is based on the campy tv show from the 1960's under the same appellation . \nmind you , most people ( including yours truly ) who will see this movie will not have seen any episodes from the original series . \nthe movie is really a stand alone in that regard . \nthe family robinson . . . lost in space . \nplot : set in the year 2058 , the family robinson is chosen to sail out into space in search of other planets that might contain the natural resources earth needs in order to survive its future . \na colonization process , if you will . \nthey are joined by able pilot west ( leblanc ) , and evil uninvited stowaway ( oldman ) , who does not want to see the trip conclude on a successful tip . \neventually , their trek goes awry , and all are \" lost in space \" . \n \" how do get back to earth ? \" \nis the question that infests the rest of this sci-fi epic . \ncritique : this film reminded me a lot of the fifth element ( 6 . 5/10 ) from the summer of 1997 . \nit's a film with a lot of flash , but very little actual substance . \nadmittedly , there isn't an annoying character like chris tucker from the other film , but this film does run a little too long , and did lose me in regards to its complex time-travel / multi-dimensional story line . \nhaving said that , the special effects in this movie were amazing , and the overall look and feel were also way above average . \nyou really felt like you were in the future , and riding through space with these poor souls . \nunfortunately for this chosen family , their 10-year old son is the smartest one in the group , and the father is too wrapped up in his work to notice the rest of his family ( ever heard that one before ? \nyawn ! ) . \nthe acting is ok , and i was especially surprised at the solid performance by tv friend's matt leblanc who shows us all that he's definitely more than just a pretty face . \non the down side , the family riff-raff that cuts through most of the picture is lame and time-consuming ( even though we gotta give them credit for \" trying \" to develop characters in a sci-fi pic ) , the story line is hard to follow , the evil character in the movie actually tells people that he's \" evil \" , and the movie goes on for about 20 minutes too long . \non the slick side , many of the special effects are really cool ( the sequence in which the family is \" paralyzed \" during the hyper-drive is awesome , and the animated monkey that joins the family halfway through the flic is mucho cool ) , the credit presentation at the end of the film is slamming , and the adventures that they fall into are somewhat thrilling ( i will also admit that \" somehow \" they got me to semi-tear up near the conclusion of this picture . . . . very \nodd . . . . . ) . \noverall , if you're a big sci-fi fan , check this movie out for the special effects and challenging narrative , and if you're not , i would still suggest seeing this movie , but then you could probably wait until it comes out on video so that you forward past some of the boring parts . \nlittle known facts : this film will always be remembered as the movie that knocked titanic ( 7/10 ) out of the top spot at the box-office after 15 straight weeks at number one

popular protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , but , in many ways , the alien franchise itself--box office receipts were anemic , thanks to poor audience word of mouth ; and the critics who rallied around the first two installments , 1979's alien and 1986's aliens , savaged david fincher's slog of a sendoff ( myself included ) . \nhence , weaver , director jean-pierre jeunet , and the others behind alien resurrection faced a two-fold challenge--not only somehow resurrect ripley , but also rescue this once-profitable series from the scrap heap . \ndespite the odds , they have succeeded , even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two . \nwriter joss whedon devises a quick , easy , and painless answer to the dead ripley problem--clone her , which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161 , the prison planet of the third film . \nthat done , the _real_ challenge presents itself--what do with her . \nalien introduced ripley as smart and resourceful ; aliens simultaneously toughened her up and made her more vulnerable , exploring her maternal side ; alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death . \nwhat could be next ? \nwhedon comes up with a clever spin : since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen , the blood used for the clone is also \" infected \" with alien dna . \nso the new ripley is , indeed , new--a human/alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength , a psychic bond with the deadly species , and a more predatory attitude . \nunfortunately , that is where alien resurrection's clever streak in writing stops . \nthe alien series is known for having stronger stories than most creature features . \nbut the story in resurrection is more of an afterthought . \nthe movie begins with a plot involving some military types attempting to train aliens to do their bidding , but once the creatures break free , it is once again ripley and a ragtag crew ( this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers , including tough waif call , played by a game winona ryder ) trying to exterminate them . \nand the alien ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited to its full potential ; i would have liked deeper exploration into the quandary of becoming one of the species she has spent her entire life trying to destroy . \nwhile the settling into tried-and-true formula is a little disconcerting , the formula is tried-and-true for a reason , and jeunet tackles the proceedings with giddy abandon . \nthe alien , after all these years , is still terrifying , and a new breed that is introduced is no less so . \nthe violence is appropriately grisly and extreme , and the action set pieces are suspenseful and exciting , most notably an extended underwater sequence . \nthe film is absolutely mesmerizing visually , thanks to the solid work done by production designer nigel phelps and cinematographer darius khondji . \nas technically adept as jeunet's direction is , perhaps his ( and , for that matter , whedon's ) greatest contribution is the infusion of humor into this notably downbeat and serious series . \na sense of humor may seem to go against everything this horror show stands for , but the self-awareness of the excess just adds to the fun . \nno , alien resurrection is not the great film that ridley scott's alien or the even greater film that james cameron's aliens was . \nbut after the dauntingly slow gloom and doom of fincher's alien3 , jeunet's resurrection is a welcome return to its roots as a wild , reckless thrill ride . \nthat is what made the alien series so popular in the first place , and that is what will keep the series popular in any future installments . \n", "most sequels don't do what they're supposed to do like \" toy story 2 \" does . \nfar too many of them end up re-hashing the original and adding very little . \nis it any wonder that most sequels fail to live up to their predecessors ? \nthankfully , \" toy story 2 \" is a wonderful exception . \ni can't remember the last time i saw a sequel as consistently fun and inventive as this one . \nit's yet another sign that pixar , the acclaimed animation studio behind \" toy story \" and \" a bug's life , \" is still at the top of its game . \nwoody and buzz are back in the sequel to the 1995 hit \" toy story , \" and things have changed a bit since the last one ended . \nwoody ( voiced by tom hanks ) is preparing to leave with his owner andy for cowboy camp . \nin his absence , he has assigned buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) , now comfortable in his role as a toy , to take charge . \nunfortunately , woody's trip is ruined when he is accidentally put into the family garage sale , and is stolen by an over-zealous toy collector ( wayne knight ) . \noff to save him are buzz and members of the old \" toy gang , \" including mr . potato head ( don rickles ) , rex the nervous dinosaur ( wallace shawn ) , hamm the piggy bank ( john ratzenberger ) , and slinky dog ( jim varney ) . \nwhile in captivity , woody makes a startling discovery : he is actually part of a collection of toys based on a 1950's children's show entitled \" woody's roundup . \" \nhe meets the show's other characters , which include jesse ( joan cusack ) , his cowgirl sidekick , the wise old prospector ( kelsey grammer ) , and bullseye , his trusty horse . \nthey have all been anxiously awaiting woody's arrival , as once their set is completed , they will be sold to a japanese toy museum , and finally escape storage forever . \nthis means woody now faces a difficult choice . \nwith his friends coming to rescue him , does he go with them and spend a few more years with andy , or does he go to japan and be immortalized forever ? \nas in the original film , \" toy story 2 \" contains first-rate animation , and pixar studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there . \nreportedly , the film was originally slated for a direct-to-video release , but after seeing the improvements that had been made , disney rightly decided to release it into theaters . \nthe film is well worth seeing on the big screen . \nthe colors are bright , the textures sharp , and even the human characters look more \" human . \" \nthe animation is consistently seamless , with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable . \nthere are so many impressive sequences that i'd find it impossible to list them here , but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al' s toy barn , the store owned by woody's captor . \npixar's rendition of the family dog is also nicely done , with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it . \nthe voice work is also perfectly complementary , and as with the first movie , does much to help further character development . \ntom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz , making you forget who is doing the voice . \nit was woody and buzz up there , not tom and tim . \nall the cast members from the original reprise their roles , and each is excellent . \nseveral new voices have been added , with joan cusack , kelsey grammer , and wayne knight doing fine work . \n \" toy story 2 \" is strong in characterization , and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie . \nwoody faces difficult choices , while buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasn't yet realized his status as a toy , forcing him to see what he used to be like . \nthe new characters are also developed quite well , especially jesse , who narrates a sarah mclachlan-aided flashback illustrating how she was loved , then forgotten by her owner . \nit may be computer-animated , and it may have sappy music , but it's downright touching . \nthe script , despite having a story and screenplay each credited to four different writers , is endlessly clever and inventive , especially considering that it's a sequel . \nthe reason \" toy story 2 \" works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the original's success by re-doing the same story and using the same characters . \nnot this one . \nwe get character change , new characters , and new issues brought up . \n \" toy story 2 \" is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself . \nthere is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here . \nthe humor is sharp and witty , with something to amuse both kids and adults . \nthere are funny asides to films such as \" star wars \" and \" jurassic park , \" among others , new takes on classic toys like barbie and rock 'em sock 'em robots , and appearances from other pixar efforts \" a bug's life \" and the 1997 short \" geri 's game . \" \n ( geri himself makes an appearance as a toy repairman who fixes woody's broken arm . ) \nthe action is fast and furious , and the chases ( in the street , in a toy store , in an elevator , on a baggage carousel , and in an airplane ) keep getting bigger and better . \n \" toy story 2 \" never grows stagnant , because there is always something new to hold your interest . \nthe more you pay attention to it , the more rewarding it is . \nit's rare to see a film like \" toy story 2 \" come along , because it's the kind of film that's almost impossible to dislike . \nit's created purely to entertain , and though i enjoy a thought-provoking drama as much as the next person , it's nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what movies first tried to do : send us out with a smile . \nit's a fair bet that the whole family will have smiles on their collective faces after seeing \" toy story 2 . \" it's the rare sequel that manages to expand on , and live up to , the original . \n", "expectation rating : a bit worse than expected ( mainly because i found the middle part to be a bit dull ) . \nroger ebert gave it a four star review , and while he is a critic that uses the full scale , and i often agree -- such as dark city being the best film of 1998 , he must have seen a better film . \ni read the book about five years ago and hugely enjoyed it . \nthe opening of a simple plan reminded me a bit of the sweet hereafter . \nthe landscape is snowy and cold , and is filmed what i feel is in a rather crisp manner ( which also reminds me of fargo ( which i loathed ) ) . \none can almost sense the cold . \nbut the movie far from the eye popping delights of the quick and the dead , instead raimi has made a more constrained film -- which probably is for the better . \nthis is probably not a movie that would have been improved by lots of odd shots . \nthe movie also reminded me of affliction , as the lead characters all seem to be hoping for and seeing a possibility to lead a better life than their father , and they see a chance for such a dream to come true . \nthis chance is uncovered in a snow covered field , where an airplane has crash landed . \nin the plane three men find ? the american dream . . . \nin a gym bag . ? \naffliction too was set in a snowy landscape . \nit really seems very simple . \njust hold on to the money until spring , and if no one claims it , they'll be safe to spend it and their hope of experiencing the american dream can come true . \nbut the snow melts , and so might several of the character's hopes . \nas in ? return to paradise ? , some of the characters are presented with a chance to do the right thing . \nbut doing the right thing might not result in a better result than something more selfish . \nthe movie's biggest strength is that it fact makes sense . \ni have seen many movies based on books that just seem like selected scenes from the book visualized , eschewing anything remotely resembling a coherent story -- for example clear and present danger . \nthe biggest problem seems to over-familiarization with the story . \nthe writer perhaps feels that he doesn't have to present scenes that are clear to him , but the lack of which only baffles an audience which has not read the book . \nthis is definitely not the problem with a simple plan , even though the screenplay is by the book's author . \nthe movie is always clear on where it's going , and always makes sense . \ni'm sue a lot was cut , but really i can't remember what . \neven a minor scene involving a man complaining that he has paid for too much grains is included . \nthe man only comes in on mondays , but he claims that he has been charged for one purchase too many . \nturns out . . . \nwell , see the movie . \none should be warned against seeing the trailer . \nit reveals several scenes from the ending moments ( which yes , like in the book , it is a downer ) , several plot developments , and much of the beginning . \nbut much of this is not spelled directly out during the trailer , so if you're lucky , you'll have forgotten about all of this when you see the movie . \n", "in 1912 , a ship set sail on her maiden voyage across the atlantic for america . \nthis ship was built to be the largest ship in the world , and she was . \nshe was also build to be one of the most luxurious , and that she was . \nfinally , she was built to be unsinkable and that unfortunately she was not . \nto get a ticket for this voyage you either : spent a life's savings to get to america to start life anew , were part of the upper class and had the money to spare , or finally were lucky enough to have a full house in a poker match by the docks like jack dawson . \njack dawson makes the trip , and happens to be at the right place at the right time . \nrose dewitt bukater , a first class passenger , climbs the railings at the aft of the ship with thoughts of jumping . \nthus is started a tale of romance and intrigue , and a tale of death and tragedy . . . \nthis movie is about a tragic event that took place a great many years ago , an even that should not be taken lightly as any other bit of historical trivia . \nthe movie titanic shows what happened , maybe not with a 100% degree of accuracy , but it still shows it very realisticaly . \nnow the titanic is both a story on its own and a backdrop for a story . \nit serves as both admirably , brining forth an interesting story that although simple in its most simple premise is very captivating . \nthis movie is very emotional simply because of what it is , but that alone is not enough . \nthe story is brought out with a certain style that makes is so much more emotional and so much more effective . \nmovies such as this will not be forgotten all too quickly and unfortunately then are not something that is produced by hollywood with any great frequency . \nthe attention to detail that was paid is remarkable . \nthe whole premise for the telling of the story is interesting , with the showing of brand new footage from the wreck of the titanic adding much flavor to an already good movie . \npart of the magical chemistry behind this story is the acting , and for this movie its extremely good acting from the whole cast . \nthe performances put in by the main stars is something to be admired . \nthe characters were played out so memorably that both leonardo dicaprip and kate winslet should receive at the least nominations for their roles . \nlooking at the acting done in the movie it seems as if they aren't acting but are actually the characters in the movie . \nthe casting for the movie could really have been better , in my humble opinion that is . \none character that will most likely not be mentioned by any other review or commentary about this film is that of the ship itself . \nyes , you read correctly , the ship is a character . \nhow is the titanic a character ? \nyou ask well simple , a ship had a certain character about it and as most sailors and boats men will tell you . \nthis character is everything about the ship from its specifications to its luxuries and the titanic was no stranger to this . \nmr . cameron brings the ship to life in an almost literal sense . \nall this adds to the movie in a certain way that most hollywood productions cant seem to grasp . \nnow , to produce the effect that i mentioned above and to sink the ship itself are feats that are accomplished by special effects wizards . \nthe effects in this movie range from marvelous costumes to beautifully rendered scenes of the ships sinking . \nin some respects you cannot tell that the effects are there , you simply think that what you see is what happened or what is happening ( if your imagination is good ) . \nthe technical wizardry done in this movie is just spectacular and actually getting new footage from the wreck of the titanic is unique . \nthe movie will leave you amazed at the effects , and that is a feat since there is no monsters or aliens in this movie , just humans and an oversized ship . \nthe movie will amaze you and it will pull on your emotions , the theater that i went to had a few people leaving with tears in their eyes . \nnow that is not a feat accomplished by most movies , now the fact that the tragedy actually occurred is brought home with something of a punch , i wont spoil the ending and say what happens regardless it is an interesting movie from beginning to the very end . \nthe historical value of this movie is quite high , and honestly is something that should be watched for the sake of seeing it and seeing the tragedy , for it is extremely well done . \nthe method of telling the story is also good , maybe not totally unique but effective none the less . \nregardless of anything mentioned above this movie is a grandiose production and the sheer size of the project undertaken is something to be marveled at . \nthe simple fact that the movie is smashingly successful at what it aims to achieve is just astonishing . \nif you get the chance to see this movie go ! ! ! \nit might not be the best movie in the world . . \nbut it ranks fairly highly and is well worth the time spent watching it . \nduring none of the 3 hours and 13 minutes of the movie are you bored nor does your attention wane from the movie . \n", "the start of this movie reminded me of parts from the movie stargate . \npeople are looking around in an egyptian temple reading about some dangerous thing that is going to destroy earth in the future . \nafter a sort of confusing bit involving fake-looking cyborg things , the movie jumps into the future and the movie improves by leaps and bounds . \nthe basic idea behind the movie is that every once in a while ( make that every 1000 years or so ) an evil force comes to destroy earth . \nthe things needed to defend against this menace are the four elements of nature plus the fifth element . \nthe plot in this movie really isn't that important to the thing though . \nthis movie has very good special effects , for the most part . \nthe techno-ish music in the background fits the mood very well . \nbruce willis is an illegal taxi-cab driver in a futuristic new york city . \none day a lady draped with a few bandages drops down into his trunk . \nthis movie is about what happens . \nthe plot twists are interesting and the movie never fails to present the viewer with a variety of different locations . \nalso there is a fair bit of action in the film , particularly towards the end . \nsome characters are just plain strange including a highly-energetic deejay in drag . \nbruce willis does his normal job of blowing things away like he always does . \nthe movie is definitely watchable and rarely slows down . \nit is one of those sci-fi films where you'll be saying \" cool \" followed by a \" what the hell ? ! ? ! \" . \ni give the fifth element . \n", "note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \njames toback's return to directing after a eight-year layoff , two girls and a guy , is a film which is comprised , more or less , of just that : one guy , blake ( robert downey jr . ) ; two girls , carla ( heather graham ) and lou ( natasha gregson wagner ) ; one primary setting ( blake's absurdly spacious bachelor apartment ) , and a great deal of dialogue . \nembracing a near real-time approach , this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr . toback for his bantering characters . \nfortunately , the film's cast is up to the challenge , and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters , while admittedly variable , are occasionally wickedly amusing . \nthe film's setup is fairly generic in nature , and opens rather unpromisingly . \nwe meet self-possessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou , both waiting outside a soho loft . \nas they engage in idle chatter , it is revealed that they're both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport , and it doesn't take long for them to come to the realisation that they're being two-timed by the same guy . \nmore indignant with him than catty with each other , the duo break into blake's loft and await his arrival for a confrontation . \nit's when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride . \nplayed with magnificent bombast by mr . downey jr . , blake is a cad , all right , but a captivatingly dynamic , blusterous , and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights . \nit's fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat , and perhaps the film's best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return , allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others , but by his own innate behaviour . \nwhether he's flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi , or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds ( carla , lou , and his unseen sickly mother ) , it's never less than wildly entertaining and insightful . \nthough at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one-man show -- a typical afternoon in the life of blake , if you will -- carla , and then lou , reveal themselves , and the sparks begin to fly . \n ( one of the great touches in the film is how blake , when startled by carla's unannounced appearance , begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat's out of the bag . ) \ndouble-teamed by the understandably aggrieved women ( who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful -- they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy ) , an increasingly-flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even self-righteous declarations against their verbal jabs . \nsurprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters , two girls and a guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was off-limits for this film . \nhowever , it'd be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lou's outrage to full feature-length , and it's as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel . \nthe dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever , the film's tempo loses its liveliness , the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion , and several sequences fall flat . \nsubtle and not-quite-subtle allusions are made ( a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall ) , and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale . \none key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla . \ntwo girls and a guy was embroiled in a bitter , long-running dispute with the mpaa with regards to this scene -- contractually-obligated to deliver an r-rated film , mr . toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaled-down versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc-17 rating in favour of an r -- and while admittedly titillating , the net effect of the vignette on the film's thematic narrative is rather dubious . \nif anything , two girls and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr . downey jr . , whose versatility is put to the test in this film . \nhe plays the gamut from indignant to humbled , from self-assured to disconcerted , yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered . \nit's a wonderful performance in a role custom-tailored for him ; mr . toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr . downey jr . was arrested on drug charges , and it's hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character -- in a monologue to his mirrored reflection , blake's self-chiding to \" get [his] shit together \" is disquieting in its resonance . \nwhile mr . downey jr . 's showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film , both actresses are solid in more broadly-observed roles . \nms . graham is quickly becoming one of america's more daring actresses , involving herself in three successive risky projects -- two girls and a guy and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank , while lost in space has a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman . \nshe's quite appealing here , playing a character at once both dainty and sultry . \nmeanwhile , ms . gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely to find it either annoying , or , like me , endearing . \nshe tones it down substantially as the film progresses , but i found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox . \nthe film was reportedly shot in eleven days , filmed mostly in sequence , and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout . \ntwo girls and a guy has an agile , spontaneous sort of feel , and one senses that mr . toback encouraged a good deal of improvisation from his three actors . \nwhile the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact , it doesn't feel constricted ; the expansive apartment setting is well-used to vary the background , and mr . toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his characters in an effective manner . \ntwo girls and a guy falls short of its potential , but thanks to some stellar work by mr . downey jr . , it's still often an enjoyable , bitingly funny romp , particularly as we watch the surprisingly-resilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour and even turn the tables on his girlfriends . \n \" i'm an actor , \" he tells them at one point , using the ol' tried-and-tested occupational-hazard defense . \n \" actors lie . \" \nbut not , they all seem to agree , denzel washington . \n", "robert altman's cookie's fortune is that rare movie that does not depend on sentimentality to be uplifting and to make its viewers feel good . \nit is a sunny , delightful , dreamy comedy , filled with lovely performances , skillful direction and topped off with an understated , clever , extraordinary script . \nas this is an ensemble piece , it is forced to start of slowly as it introduces us to its characters , all of them residing in a southern town called holly springs . \nfirst we meet willie ( charles s . dutton ) , an honest man with a slight drinking habit . \nwe then see that willie takes care of an elderly lady nicknamed cookie , who is slowly losing her grip on sanity and is being filled with loneliness , despair , and want of her dead husband . \nwe cut to camille ( glenn close ) who is obsessively directing a play with her sister cora ( julianne moore ) . \nthen we briefly get acquainted with emma ( liv tyler ) , an apparent relative of cookie , who is a down-but-not-out teen outcast , still full of love and hope even though she has no real place to live . \nwe also fleetingly see emma's lover jason ( chris o'donnell ) , an ambitious but far too excitable young cop . \nwe are now about one quarter through the two hour picture , and robert altman decides that it is time to set the plot in motion . \nwe see the ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at a picture of her husband . \nshe exclaims \" here i come ! \" \nand then puts a pillow to her face and shoots herself . \nsoon after , her niece camille stops by to get a fruit salad bowl , comes upstairs , finds cookie dead and flips out . \nconvinced that suicide is a disgrace and that she will have none of that in her family , she eats the suicide note and convinces her slightly slow ( yet sweet ) sister that it was a murder . \nshe makes sure that she stages it like a murder as well ; scattering jewelry all over the floor , breaking a few cabinets , windows and doors , and then throwing the gun out in the back yard . \nthe only reasonable suspect is willie , who immediately gets taken into custody , and put in a jail cell ( they all know he didn't do it , so the cell stays open and he plays scrabble with the sheriff and the faithful emma ) . \nmeanwhile , the unperturbed camille continues her none-too-subtle manipulations trying to further cover up for the murder while at the same time making her easter play a success . \nso begins cookie's fortune , a film aptly described by critic scott renshaw as \" a southern spin on fargo , \" except that this one is far funnier and much more enjoyable than the coen brothers' darker , somewhat disturbing and slightly overrated escapade . \nrobert altman's slight picture is in some ways reminiscent of something like midnight in the garden of good and evil as well , in that both films focus ( on and off ) on the eccentricities of the residents in a southern us town . \nindeed , most of the characters in cookie's fortune are loads of fun to observe , and a portion of them are fascinating and surprisingly multi- dimensional . \nglenn close turns in an insubstantial ( in terms of her career ) but magnificent performance as the conniving camille and is also the source of a good portion of the many laughs that we enjoy in this movie , and she is perfectly cast as the prolific \" aunt alexandria \" character , endlessly obsessed with family dignity . \nthe equally essential role of willie is handled with an intangible grace by veteran thespian charles s . dutton ( mimic , a time to kill ) \nthere is nothing like a movie which leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside hours , even days after the film ends . \ncookie's fortune is such a movie . \ni loved the light , kindhearted approach altman ( whose last project was the dark , intense drama the gingerbread man ) took towards the tricky subject matter . \ni enjoyed the talented ensemble cast . \ni even liked the trite \" in the south everybody is related to everybody \" cliche that is inevitably employed by the time this movie draws to a close . \ni'm not sure why cookie's fortune had such an all-around pleasing effect on me . \nperhaps it's that good ol' southern charm . \n", "well i'll be damned . . . \nthe canadians can make a good movie . \nthe world is coming to an end . \nwe don't know why or how , but apparently there is no way to stop it . \nthe world has had this information for months , as most of the rioting and other assorted chaos has passed

themselves for the end . . . \nsome engaging in activities they've always wanted to do , some gathering with family and friends , and others just seeking to be alone . \nthese people's lives however all intersect during their final six hours . \nwriter-director-star don mckellar has crafted a highly unique and emotional film . \nall of the main characters are compelling as they try and do whatever it is they need to do on their last night on earth . \ncraig ( callum keith rennie ) tries to fulfill all his sexual fantasies , a gas company employee ( david cronenberg ) calls every customer letting them know the gas will be flowing until the very end and thanks them for their business , and patrick ( mckellar ) just wants to be by himself but isn't having much success . \neven minor characters keep popping up where you least expect them to , tying everyone even closer . \nthings seemed a little hokey towards the beginning of the film , but ultimately everything comes together nicely ( although it's not a happy film . . . \nsome moments are understandably gut-wrenching ) . \nthe story is enhanced by some unexpected humor and very realistic performances , particularly from sandra oh , whose character is just trying to get home to her husband before the end . \ni have absolutely no problem that the reason for the end of the world is never given , nor does it bother me that the world is ending at exactly 12 midnight ( in toronto anyway ) . \nbut i do wonder why the sun never sets . \ncome midnight , the sun is still shining brightly . \nmaybe the sun is crashing into the earth . . . \nwho knows . \nalso , it's comforting to know that in mankind's final moments on the planet , people will still gang up on the street for the sheer purpose of pushing over a car or a bus ( that's not a shot at this film mind you . . . \ni know people are just stupid and truly would be out in the street tipping over cars ) . \nlast night is available on dvd

campaign to shadow tommy's tours and , with the help of her manager , phyllis stein ( andrea martin ) , is trying get a law suit going against the star for stealing her songs . \nhedwig and the angry inch get gigs , not coincidentally , at a chain of seafood restaurants that just happen to be next to the forums where tommy gnosis is playing . \nthings finally come to a head , so to speak , in new york city . \nthe popularity of the off-broadway musical and its offshoots have garnered a ready-made audience base for \" hedwig . \" \nthe wit , humor , music and search for identity has great appeal to young adults , but the charismatic presence of mitchell makes this a cut above what it could have been . \nit is this one-man/woman show that casts its spotlight on its \" internationally ignored \" rock star and mitchell is outstanding in the role . \nthere isn't a lot going on with other characters , though there are amusing little sidebars , like hedwig's backup singer/lover , yitzak ( miriam shor ) , deciding to break away from the band to join a polynesian road show of \" rent \" as a puerto rican drag queen . \nthe low budget that the moviemakers have for the production belies the quality of the film . \nattention to details - hedwig's costumes and outrageous \" cabaret \" -like makeup ; the seedy trailer park setting ; and , the kitschy seafood restaurants - are loads of fun to watch and lend the appropriate air to the proceeds , all on what has to be a beer budget . \n \" hedwig and the angry inch \" may not be for everybody , but the energy of the effort , the songs , the imaginative sets and costumes and a fast steady pace make it a pleasure to watch . \nif you're a fan of contemporary , edgy music , it is an even bigger draw . \ni give it a b+ . \n", "niagara niagara ( r ) bob gosse's niagara niagara follows a blueprint not unlike a lot of young-lovers-on-the-road movies . \nwild marcy ( robin tunney ) and calm seth ( henry thomas ) meet cute , literally running into each other while shoplifting at a local store . \na mere couple of scenes later , the two embark on a journey to toronto from their small , unnamed american town in pursuit of a rare doll that marcy desperately wants . \nalong the way , true love inevitably blossoms . \nwhat sets niagara niagara apart , though , is that marcy is afflicted with tourette's syndrome , a neurological disorder that causes sudden muscle and vocal tics . \ntunney , displaying an acting range not hinted at in the teenage witch thriller the craft , delivers an astonishing performance that won her the best actress prize at last year's venice film festival . \nto term her work a tour-de-force is not to imply that she attacks the scenery ; tunney's effectiveness lies in her modulation and vulnerability , which makes her depiction of marcy's illness--which often causes her to act violently--that much more convincing and tragic . \nshe and the nicely subtle thomas develop a sweetly innocent and beguilingly off-kilter chemistry . \ntheir journey hits a few rough spots creatively along the way , mostly the fault of writer matthew weiss . \na detour involving a kindly widower ( michael parks ) who takes the couple in brings the story to a screeching halt , and the key character of a trigger-happy pharmacist ( stephen lang ) is highly unbelievable . \nbut these missteps do not blunt the power of tunney's bravura turn , which carries niagara niagara to a level of poignance it would not have otherwise achieved . \n ( opens march 20 ) \n \" i didn't know what to expect .

in 1991 . . . or , \nmy thoughts after meeting him on november 21 , 1997 \n", "notice : this is a review and analysis of exotica . \nthe first part of this piece is the review , the second part contains some analysis of the movie which might be construed as spoilers . \nif you have not seen the movie and after reading the first part you intend to do so , then save the second part for the discussion afterwards . \nstarring : bruce greenwood , mia kirshner , elias kosteas , don mckellar , arsinee khanijian , sarah polley director : atom egoyan screenplay : atom egoyan \nexotica is a film that grows on retrospection . \nexotica keeps the viewer guessing about the relationship between the various characters in the film . \nall of the people know each other , but apart from that , there seems to be no other reason why to select such set and follow them in this fictional account . \nthe director hints for possible solutions , using a multi-line plot , so popular with critics in mystery train , and used to good advantage by quentin tarantino in pulp fiction . \nexotica reaches a whole new dimension using this technique . \nat the end it is surprising to see how well the pieces of the puzzle fit together , in spite their apparent unconnectedness and even misleading features . \nthe out-of-chronological-order technique has become ever so popular , perhaps even de rigueur , for biographical films . \nsimilarly , we can now expect to see more movies in the future which will use , to varying extent , converging multiplots . \non a first glance , once the multi-plot puzzle in exotica is solved , there seems to be little left to look at . \nbut perceptive minds which take the time to dig further will be rewarded with interesting views on life or rather , commentaries on views of life . \nexotica is very much worth seeing . \nit opened to critic's praise worldwide ( i first saw it in mexico city , last december ) . \nin canada , it broke records for a movie of its kind , which prompted the american distributor to go for a wide release . \napart from a strong plot , acting is very convincing , and the soundtrack seems as if made for the movie . \nthe spoon-fed-entertainment crowd may not appreciate this movie , and thus it might last little on screen . \nbut if you want to try a movie a cut above the crowd , with an originality that is ever so rare , by all means see exotica . \nanalysis ( * * spoilers * * ahead ) \nwhat is behind the complex plot in exotica ? \nfirst , a common theme of the quest for gratification by monetary means . \nthe lone tax-auditor , the repressed homosexual pet shop owner , the pregnant woman which runs the nightclub , the rich man which has the club remodeled , the audience at the movie theatre , all use personal wealth to buy palliative relief for the penuries of the soul . . . . \nthen we have the quest for gratification through visual means by most of the same people , including those who sit watching exotica . . . . \nin that regard exotica stands for onlookers at a nightclub , for the rich man looking through silver mirrors , and poor-rich people looking at other's people lives through a silver screen . \nexotica also stands for unwanted society attention into the lives of other people , such as the tax auditor and the pet shop owner . \nexotica is the customer agent looking at the pet shop owner , which in turn is looking at the core of the problems between the strip dancer and the tax auditor through the detached eye of a gay person ( no attraction to the strip dancer ) , and only interested on avoiding jail ( no personal relationship with the tax auditor ) . \nin exotica everybody is watching , and what is worse , everybody knows . \nsecond , exotica is about isolated people holding back their feelings ; about people which by voluntary or involuntary means transfer their view of reality to other characters . \nthe strip dancer becomes the proverbial daughter , the dj becomes the proverbial killer by means of breaking the relationship between the father and the proverbial daughter . \nthe niece becomes the baby sitter , the baby sitter becomes the dancer , and the dancer becomes the proverbial daughter . \nthe pet shop owner becomes the proverbial dj , by finding the proverbial daughter . \na chain made of real and imagined links coming around full circle , just as everything comes around to a fitting whole at the end of the movie . \n", "i actually am a fan of the original 1961 or so live-action-disney flick of the same name starring hayley mills twice as a pair of twins , separated at birth by divorcing parents , never to come in contact with the other so the parents never have to meet again . \nand everyone should know how i feel about remakes , especially of films i happen to enjoy ( my fallacy : unless you're going to either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both , just wrack your brain and come up with a * gasp * new idea ) . \nthis remake was not originally on the top of my viewing list , and was actually quite the opposite . \ncontemporary live-action-disney films are not one of my favorties , anyway : they're usually unfunny , alienating , and a big fat bore , at least to anyone over the age of 11 and above the iq of 10 . \nthis one , however , is shockingly not bad . \nin fact , it's actually good . \nnot the original good , but what's great about it is that it doesn't necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit as it does become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was entertaining . \nbecause it's cute and innocent fun . \nbecause it has a pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with . \nbecause the lead star is immensely appealing . \nbecause the parents are also immensely appealing . \nand ( i'm repeating myself ) because it's cute and innocent fun . \nthere's nothing too risque about it , save the plot ( the idea of separating twins and denying them the truth for years is ominously selfish , but that is precisely the point of the movie ) , and it's aimed directly at either kids , adults who want to remember the original , or young adults who want to remember what it was like to be a kid . \ni , personally , am somewhere between the second and third . \ni can vividly remember when my taste in movies wasn't so weird or diverse ( the names godard and kubrick weren't even a glimmer in my right eye back then ) , when i would tune in every sunday night for a couple years to see abc's \" wonderful world of disney , \" where they'd show you a live-action and/or made-for-tv disney flick an hour per week . \ni can remember my mom taking my sister and i along with all my friends and their mothers to see all the rereleased disney films ( like \" lady and the tramp \" and \" pinnochio \" ) . \nand , most sadly , i remember every single christmas , without fail , there were a barage of children's animated half-hour shows , made exclusively for the christmas season , that i wouldn't dare missing . \ni can even remember seeing the made-for-tv \" parent trap ii \" on tv one night , and after i had seen that one over and over and over again , i saw the original \" parent trap . \" \nit's more of a late childhood movie , because it deals with the issue of divorce , but it deals with it in a disney-ized version . \nit's playful , and witty , and charming , and if i saw it for the first time right now , having never experienced that part of my childhood , i'd probably dismiss it . \ni'd probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if i hadn't seen the original at such a perfect age . \nwatching it , i could remember what fun it was to watch a disney film , and how divorce for me started to get me thinking about the possibilities of my seemingly-perfect parents splitting up , and how it affected my adolescence . \nand also how it brushed that fear off with a smooth stroke , and pointed out that even in the most fucked-up of situations , things could always work out if you , well , manipulate things a bit , at least for the better . \nthis new version did that for me , but it's also charming in its own way . \nit has a new cast , a contemporary feel , and , for the first time in awhile for a live-action-disney flick , a tone that isn't corny or condescending , but just right . \nthe moments that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way . \nand for the first time since the original film , the kids actually know better than the foolish adults . \nthe story is basically classic by now , repeated almost as many times as kurosawa's \" the seven samurai \" : a pair of twins ( played here by lindsay lohan , just like they were played by hayley mills in the original ) are separated at birth by their divorcing parents . \none , annie , is sent to live with the mother ( natasha richardson , resembling her mother , vanessa redgrave , more than i had ever noticed ) in london , where she lives with her parents and her devoted , foppish butler ( simon kunz ) , as she works as a swingin' fashion designer . \nshe grows up refined and classy , but also with a keen knowledge in sports and poker-playing . \nthe other , hallie , is sent to northern california with her father ( dennis quaid ) to live on a vineyard with their pseudo-maid ( lisa ann walter ) , and grows up rugged yet charming . \nthey both meet at the same camp , one that annie wants to go to to become more rugged . \nthey feud because they look all-too similar , and are thus in tight competition , which results in some nasty pranks , which winds them in seclusion together in a private , out-of-the-way cabin . \nthere , they become friends , then learn about eachother . \nonce they know everything , they concoct a scheme to switch places so the one can meet the other parent , whom they've only heard of . \nthey learn about eachother's lives in detail , they make sure they look alike ( which requires hair cutting and , notoriously , ear-piercing - a scene which is like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene in \" pulp fiction \" ) , and when the end of summer comes , they switch and hope for the best . \nlindsay lohan doesn't necessarily copy the acting style of hayley mills in the original . \nbut she comes off just as appealing as she did once . \nshe does , though , add a couple new things : she makes the california twin a little more appealing and the london twin a bit more frank and snobbish than the snotty and proper original , respectively . \nshe also adds on an american and british accent to each one , with one faking the other accent throughout , and if you really take notice , you can see that the fake ones' accents aren't exactly perfect . \nshe's also incredibly appealing , not merely cute , which is especially notable since this is her first feature film , and we know how notorious child actors are , especially in their first films . \nshe makes a great protagonist , and it only helps that the supporting cast is equally appealing . \ndennis quaid , in fact , hasn't been this likable in about a decade - his big dumb smile and near cocky attitude is what has made him a notable actor in the past , not just that he's mr . meg ryan . \nditto natasha richardson ( except that she just hasn't ever been this likable period ) . \nthe two make a winning couple , maybe not so winning as maureen o'hara and the late brian keith in the original , but they still work for this film . \ninstead of the bickering that ensued in the original , the film adds another dimension and another angle to their characters that was amiss in the original : during the opening credits , we see glimpses from their courtship on the qe2 , where they fall quickly and madly in love with eachother , and when back together again , the film's more smarmy scenes come off as actually sentimental , but in that great way , not the migraine-inducing way as in many such films . \nthis all brings this new \" parent trap \" to a level of entertainment that hasn't really existed since , well , the original film years ago , still my money the best live-action-disney flick of all time . \nthis is because it has a form of intelligence and wit that makes such plot points as an otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot ( a gold-digging sharon stone type , played by elaine hendrix , who's deliciously tormented by the twins later on in the film ) a treat instead of a bore . \nlike the original , this film transcends all the crap that it very well could be ( case in point : \" it takes two \" starring the olsen twins ) because it treats the children as the smart ones , and the adults as the silly ones , not the other way around . \nand because , above everything , it knows exactly how to be charming without biting off more than it can chew . \nhowever , in comparison with the original , it could be a bit better . \ncertain scenes work well , but not nearly as well as they worked in the original . \ni liked the way the parents fought over past dilemnas and then fought over falling in love again better than i liked watching two old flames getting back together over a bottle of wine - somehow , feuding is always more cinematic and pleasing than mere reminscing , a lesson extracted from the howard hawks/cary grant films of yesteryear . \nand as much as this film transcends mere cutedom , compared to the original , this film almost drowns in cutedom . \nthe original , though not gritty , was far more stylized and just as suitable for adult audiences as it was for young audiences . \nas such , this remake may never be nearly as great or classic as the original film , but it at least knows how to treat its source material with dignity and respect , and how to create virtually the same effects without bordering on plagerism or petty annoyances . \n", "gere , willis , poitier chase each other around the world \nthe jackal a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman \nwhen the soviet union imploded , the western countries lost their shadow . \nwith the united states friendly with the russians , we no longer had an entity to blame for the world's problems . \nthis showed up in hollywood films as the communist government was no longer the easy bad guy . \nit's time to rejoice because we've found our new villain . \nnow it's no longer the russian government who sends killers out into foreign lands , it's the russian _mafia_ . \na perfect solution , it combines the dread of organized crime and the still-present uneasiness with the former eastern block countries . \nbest of all , the villains are still foreigners : fear of the other always plays best . \nso it is a crime lord in moscow that sends legendary hitman the jackal ( bruce willis ) to assassinate a highly placed us government figure in retaliation for the death of his brother during a nightclub raid . \nthe fbi is at a loss as to how to protect the target from someone they're not sure even exists . \ncoming to their rescue is former ira operative declan mulqueen ( richard gere ) who is temporarily released from prison to assist fbi agent carter preston ( sidney poitier ) and russian major valentina koslova ( diane venora ) . \nmulqueen's ex-girlfriend basque terrorist isabella ( mathilda may ) is the only person who has seen the elusive jackal . \n ( presumably there is an exclusive international terrorist club somewhere where the three met . ) \nthe film follows two parallel tracks as the jackal prepares for his $70 million hit and mulqueen attempts to locate him while preston makes sure that the irishman doesn't slip away . \ncrossing numerous borders and donning various disguises for both himself and his mini-van , the killer is always one step ahead of his pursuers . \nbeing very loosely based on the same book the 1973 thriller \" the day of the jackal \" , comparison between the two films is inevitable . \nthere is no doubt that the original is the better movie , playing the story for suspense rather than the current action/adventure . \nas a mystery , \" the jackal \" has enough holes in it to ruin the tale , but if you can accept it for what it is , there's entertainment to be had . \nholes ? let's see ? a pivotal clue for mulqueen is so obscure that he must possess psychic powers to pick it up . \nfor a 20-year veteran that can command the big bucks , the jackal is an incredibly poor shot . \nthe final scene between gere and willis occurs in a location that should be mobbed with police , but it's just the two of them . \nwillis' disguises usually look like bruce willis and are just as interesting as val kilmer's in \" the saint \" . \n ( and lest you misunderstand , that's not a compliment . ) \nbut the three stars are fun to watch . \nit's good to see gere in something other than a business suit . \nwillis has a mixed history in picking projects , but his characters are always watchable . \npoitier is by far the superior actor , but has limited screen time . \nthe problems in logic are flaws , but don't ruin the experience . \noccasionally there are movies that transcend their blemishes . \nthis is one of them . \n[the appeared in the 11/20/97 \" bloomington voice \" , bloomington , indiana] \n", "it's terribly unfortunate that \" stir of echoes , \" tautly written and directed by david koepp ( who made one of 1996's unsung treasures , \" the trigger effect \" ) , should be released little more than a month after \" the sixth sense , \" which is still going strong at the box office . \nthese two films are undoubtedly going to be compared ( judging from practically all of my fellow audience members last night ) , and although they have eerily similar storylines , \" stir of echoes \" is more of a straightforward psychological horror film , while \" the sixth sense \" is closer to a psychological drama . \nadditionally , while \" the sixth sense \" had a shocker of an ending that undoubtedly has been one of the major factors in its recent repeat business , \" stir of echoes \" is more conventional and predictable in its final twist . \nand where \" the sixth sense \" was disturbing , \" stir of echoes \" is just plain scary . \ni have a feeling most viewers are going to come away unimpressed because of the unavoidable similarities , and will foolishly forget to judge this film on its own respectable merits . \nadapted from a novel by richard matheson that was written some forty years ago , \" stir of echoes \" opens with a cute six-year-old boy named jake ( zachary david cope ) who is taking a bath . \nhe is speaking directly at the screen , but we immediately have a feeling someone else is there . \nfinally , he asks , \" does it hurt to be dead ? \" \napparently jake sees the ghosts of dead people , but unlike \" the sixth sense , \" this young child isn't the focus of the picture . \ninstead , tom witzy ( kevin bacon ) , a chicago lineman , is our protagonist . \njake is his son , and maggie ( kathryn erbe ) , whom has just discovered she is six weeks pregnant , is his hard-working wife . \none night while at a party with their closest friends , tom convinces maggie's new-age sister , lisa ( illena douglas ) , to try and hypnotize him . \nit unexpectedly works , and before long , tom is seeing things he wouldn't normally see , including a deceased teenage girl ( jenny morrison ) in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six months . \nseeking help from lisa , she tells him that , while he was under hypnosis , she told him that after he awoke , his mind will remain clear and free , like an opened door . \nshe didn't expect it to work , but it did , and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he sees . \n \" stir of echoes \" isn't a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination , but in the thick , atmospheric mood it conjures up , it is a terrifically eerie domestic horror-drama , and is not only effective on a technical level , but is impressive in its portrayal of a struggling working-class family . \nkevin bacon and , especially , kathryn erbe ( 1997's \" dream with the fishes \" ) , are top-notch and exceedingly believable as a loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems . \nafter tom is hypnotized and starts seeing ghastly visions , he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house , and instead of maggie not being understanding , she instead believes what tom says , and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through , does not try to stop his pursuit . \nbacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood stars like tom cruise and julia roberts , and therefore , are easier to relate to and always plausible as a struggling couple who have to work overtime at their jobs just to make ends meet . \nin a masterfully-done , entrancing sequence , tom is hypnotized by lisa , but instead of watching him , we instead see what he sees , starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness . \nlisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theater , and so , we , as audience members , are watching a movie screen from inside a theater , which is also showing a movie screen in a theater . \ntelling him to move closer and closer to the screen as a fuzzy word in black letters pops up on the screen , we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is \" sleep . \" \nnever before have i seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing and brilliantly-construed as this one . \ntruthfully , this set-piece , and another in which tom wakes up from a nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he has just dreamt , are worth the full price of admission alone , just to see them on the big screen . \nhaving loads of fun with her small role as maggie's sister , lisa , illeana douglas ( 1995's \" to die for , \" her last great character ) is a delight , but rarely used to her full advantage in feature films . \nfunny and enjoyably offbeat , douglas gets to utter the best line in the film : while talking to maggie about tom's visions of the girl , she remarks , \" i wouldn't be worried about him seeing another girl , although the fact that she's dead gives one pause . \" \nalso of note are jenny morrison ( 1994's \" intersection \" ) , who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character , and liza weil , remarkable in 1998's \" whatever , \" as morrison's grieving teenage sister , debbie . \nif the resolution of \" stir of echoes \" does not live up to its obviously frightful full potential ( and it doesn't ) , what comes before is both involving and appropriately gritty . \nthe music score , by james newton howard , and unsettling use of whispers and ghostly sound effects , successfully compliment and foreshadow the off-kilter frame-of-mind that tom is put into , and director david koepp proves once again that he is a director with a knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around realistically-written characters . \n \" stir of echoes \" isn't as good as \" the sixth sense , \" but why should it need to be ? \nboth films are fully capable of standing on their own two feet , and \" stir of echoes \" really is a spinetinglingly good horror film . \n", "usually when a blockbuster comes out , it's loaded with effects , stars , bad scripts , and plenty of action . \nmystery men may contain an all-star cast , and efects , but the clever script and characters are what really works , which is rare to see this year . \nthe film is based upon the comic book series \" the flaming carrot \" by bob burden , in which 3 wanna be super heroes try and fight crime , only to be out done by the real hero of champion city , captain amazing ( greg kinnear ) . \nthings go a little haywire , when the sinister casanova frankenstein ( geoffrey rush ) is released into the city , where he captures captain amazing , and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city . \nwell , the trio decide to take matters in their own hands , by saving the city , but first they need some assitance . \nthis is where the film takes a turn for the better . \nin the beggining , there were only 3 wanna be heroes . \n \" blue raja ( hank azaria ) , \" mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and \" the shoveller ( william h . macy ) . \nsure they were enterataining , but their acts grew old fast . \nthat is until they aquire \" invisible boy \" ( kel mitchell ) , and \" the bowler \" ( janeane garafalo ) and \" mr . splein \" ( paul reubens ) , 2 of which rescue the film from becoming a disastorous mess . \nthankfully , the original 3 heroes become amusing , with some support of reuben and garfalo on screen . \nthe whole premise is rather ridiculous , but packs a few punches to keep interest . \nfor one , the film is considerably clever . \nit literally pokes fun at super hero films , like batman and robin , superman etc . in fact , many scenes are similar to batman and robin , including the opening sequence , only altered in a humorous and superior way . \na part of the cleverness comes from the cast . \nsometimes a film with such talent is overblown , but the acting is what keeps it alive here . \nwhile azaria and macy were enteratining , 2 characters really stood out . \none was paul reuben . \nno matter how disgusting or revolting \" mr . splein \" may be , you still can't help but laugh . \nit' so incredibly moronic , it's just a riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions . \njaneane garafalo also was an interesting character . \nshe seemed to be the most outgoing and convincing character on screem , due to her enthusiasm , that kept the film flowing . \nmen is worth seeing alone , for those 2 troubled heroes . \non the downside , a few of the heroes and especially the villain never really lift off . \nkel mitchell and geoffrey rush , were both utterly useless . \ntheir parts were so limited , they'd be lucky at all to be on screen for more than 20 minutes . \nben stiller too was wasted , mostly because of his unlikeable power and dialogue . \nnone of these characters get a rise out of anybody , but happily they are lost in the charming flow of the film . \nas far as the budget goes , it was wisely spent on the cast , not the effects . \nwhile the set designs and action all look nice , i'm glad there was a seperate aspect , that the film focused on , and for that i applaud . \nslow at times , and rather pointless , mystery men still delivers . \nit forgets about money making , because it's not likely to make a bundle like it's proceeders , and that's what works . \nstupid ? \nmaybe , but for once i'm not disappointed . \nno one expected an intelligent film , but you get a film thats wit captures your attention and makes you forget this miserable year . \n", "review- peter jackson's the frighteners has received some notice for setting the record for most computer effects ever in a movie , and still coming in at the extremely cheap $30 million price tag . \nbut for those who were dismayed by this year's blockbusters like twister and independence day , the frighteners has much more to offer than special effects . \nand for those worried wether or not peter jackson would compromise to hollywood you can rest easily . \nthe frighteners is as far removed from hollywood as a high-profile movie can get . \nmichael j . fox stars as frank bannister , a con artist who can speak to ghosts . \nhe uses this ability to set up a scam in a small town where his ghost buddies scare the hell out of people , then he comes and pretends to get rid of them . \nthis is how he has made a living ever since his wife died in a car crash 5 years ago . \nfrank's latest customers are a young couple , played by trini alvarado and peter dobson . \nwhen dobson ends up dead , alvarado starts to take an interest in fox . \nbut dobson's spirit is still around as he refuses to beleive he's dead . \nthis leads to a very awkward and amusing dinner date between fox and alvarado , with dobson tagging along as a ghost . \nthings start getting complicated for fox when he is accused for a series of murders taking place in the town . \nfox sees someone named the soul collector crushing the heart of the victims , but noone else can see that . \nso when fox shows up to try and save each victim , naturally people suspect he is the killer . \nfox sees that alvarado is next on the soul collector's hit list , and the last half hour of the movie deals with fox's attempts to save her from this evil spirit . \nthere are many wonderful twists and turns in the screenplay written by peter jackson and frances walsh . \nthe movie starts off as a black comedy , and ends up a horror-action film . \nthe mix between these genres are perfect . \nno laughs are sacrificed in the name of horror , and vice versa . \none point of contention might be a lackluster score by danny elfman . \nbut that hardly seems like a flaw when you have such a diverse cast all in top form . \nmichael j . fox delivers one of his best performances to date as a man who hides the sorrow of his wife's death , and then is forced to confront this later on . \nalvarado , looking like andie macdowell , makes a great frightened , tough , and smart heroine . \nand jeffery combs , as a paranoid fbi agent , is brilliantly bizaare . \nthe frighteners never once feels like it is running long . \nthe first hour is as funny as any comedy this year , and the last half hour is as thrilling as any of the big budget blockbusters . \nthis movie is probably what casper would've looked like if david lynch directed it . \nit's easily the best film of the year , so far . \n", "before you read my review , you gotta know that i love woody allen . \nthis is a very important note because allen's films are generally an acquired taste and definitely not for everyone . \ni know folks who believe him to be a complete genius , while others see him as a dirty ol' schnook who keeps making the same movie over and over again . \ni love most of his films , but will admit to having been quite disappointed by his recent crop during the 90s . \nin fact , why he felt the need to make 10 movies in those 10 years is beyond me ! \nif you look at the quality of those films , you'll hear what i'm saying . \nthe only two films of his that i really liked during that time were bullets over broadway and husbands and wives . \nin fact , i secretly hoped that he would take some \" time off \" at the turn of the millennium , just to re-energize or something , but it doesn't appear as though he has any intention of doing that . \nso here i am again , reviewing yet another woody allen movie and hoping that it brings back the woody from the days of old . \nplot : the year is 1940 and woody allen is a top-notch insurance investigator . \nhis methods are very old-fashioned and apparently out of date . \na new employee ( hunt ) has just been hired to streamline the operations for greater efficiency . \nthe two do not like each other . \none night , they are both put under a hypnotic trance by a magician , and unbeknownst to them , placed under his control . \nsoon thereafter , jewels are stolen , words of love are exchanged and everyone is looking for an answer . \ncritique : a wonderful recreation of the 1940s style movies , with the fast-talking witty banter between co-workers , a catchy jazz score moving things along , film noirish elements such as the veronica lake-type sexpot , one-liners galore and a fluffy , if inconsequential plotline . \non the downside , the film actually starts off pretty slowly , with the first hour tossing only a few guffaws out there , but never really generating any kind of steady flow or energy . \nthe sets , on the other hand , were amazing , the production design and costumes were perfect , and the casting ideal , so i kept hoping that the film would pick up and not turn into yet another mediocre outing for the man . \nbut it wasn't not long before i was fully engaged by the characters , entertained by the many zingers delivered back-and-forth between allen and hunt , and actually interested in the resolution of the flick . \ni also appreciated how allen played the fine line between homage to the films of old , parody and actual reinvention ( note theron's entire female persona that is drenched in film noir- very cool ) . \nof course , films like this ( with little or no real tension in the plot ) need solid actors to keep you interested in the quick-fire dialogue , and once again , allen does a great job in playing his character , who for once , isn't his typical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husband dude . \nhe actually plays a \" macho \" guy here and handles it pretty well , especially the scenes in which he's hypnotized . \nbut the bigger surprise for me in this film was helen hunt , an actress who i was openly \" sick of seeing \" in movies late last year ( sorry babe , you were just in too many at the same time ! ) . \nanyway , she's really great in this film as the headstrong woman looking to a new era of equality amongst men , and doesn't miss a beat of allen's fast-paced dialogue . \ni didn't care much for her running joke about him \" dying \" whenever he left a room , but overall she was really good and i especially liked the way that her sweaters clung to her breasts as they did . . . yum , \nyum ! \nharumph , but i digress . \nso let's recap . \na great looking picture with a nice jazzy score , some funny one-liners , especially in the second half , a decent plotline , although you shouldn't expect a real mystery or anything , and some solid acting all around . \ni can't say that this is even remotely close to any of allen's best work , but i certainly believe it to be a step in the right direction , especially after the dinky decade of films that he just went through . \nit's probably better geared towards allen fans more than anyone else , but i would still recommend this film to anyone looking for a cute , \" old-school \" kind of vibe , with chemistry between the leads , zippy dialogue and a satisfying conclusion . \nlittle known facts about this film and its stars : annie hall ( 10/10 ) - celebrity ( 5/10 ) - everyone says i love you ( 5/10 ) - husbands and wives ( 9/10 ) - mighty aphrodite ( 5/10 ) - small

coming-of-age story for the new millennium as elle woods ( reese witherspoon ) , a perky southern california sorority queen , switches from fashion to law in order to win back her yuppy boyfriend ( matthew davis ) . \nthe girl-power story begins as this sweetheart of delta nu is unceremoniously dumped by a bonehead who says : \" if i'm going to be a senator by the time i'm 30 . . . i \nneed to marry a jackie , not a marilyn . \" \ndetermined to prove she's as smart a snobby brunette ( selma blair ) from country-club connecticut , elle not only applies to harvard law school but gets in , much to the amazement of family , friends and faculty . \nonce there , this flaxen-haired fish-out-of-water not only survives but tenaciously thrives , befriending a local manicurist ( jennifer coolidge ) , dazzling a professor ( victor garber ) and rescuing a defendant ( ali larter ) in a celebrated boston murder trial , plus finding a more worthy beau ( luke wilson ) . \nin the tradition of teen-comedy film-maker john hughes and his disciple amy heckerling , there's wit , cheerfulness , a fidelity of observation and a penchant for problem-solving . \nfirst-time feature director robert luketic is blessed with reese witherspoon who's joyously incandescent in this utterly formulaic light comedy written by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith , based on a soon-to-be-published novel by amanda brown . \nthe supporting cast is terrific , particularly raquel welch and holland taylor - and i particularly got a kick out of the gag of elle distributing scented resumes in pink , her signature color on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" legally blonde \" is a frivolous , funny , feel-good 8 . \nfilled with ditzy blonde ambition , it's a movie for high-school kids that their parents would be happy to have them see . \n", "what do you get when you combine clueless and dumb and dumber ? \nto answer the question , you get director david mirkin's new comedy romy and michele's high school reunion . \nromy white ( mira sorvino , mighty aprhodite ) and michele weinberger ( lisa kudrow , tv's friends ) have been inseparable buddies since they graduated from sagebrush high in 1987 . \nhowever , when former classmate heather mooney ( janeane garafolo , the truth about cats and dogs ) confronts romy about the 10 year reunion , she is astounded that she forgot . \nwatching pretty woman for the um-teenth time , they are reminded of how they wouldn't let julia roberts' character shop in the expensive stores because of her appearance . \nthen it hits them : they are not successful . \nwhat are she and michele going to do ? \nromy's instant solution is lose some weight off their already slender frames , \" bag a couple of boyfriends , \" and get jobs . \nromy says this will be easy , but michele retorts that if it is so easy , why hadn't they already done it . \nrobin schiff's script keeps the show moving with some nice one-liners . \none of the best has romy reminiscing about her life's battle against the bathroom scales . \n \" i was so lucky getting mono , \" she says looking at her thinnest high school picture . \n \" that was like the best diet ever . \" \nthe casting for the film is so perfect that one begins to suspect that the leads were chosen and then the script was developed . \nromy and michele use their high school yearbook to discuss the caste system at their high school . \nthe film's editor david finfer dissolves the stills from the yearbook to live action flashbacks which makes the past come to life . \nat sagebrush high , the hierarchy consisted of the a group ( cheerleaders ) , the b group ( drama club ) and the c group ( nerds ) . \nromy and michele were none of the above . \nridiculed as \" the weirdoes , \" they were constant targets for abuse . \neven though they were quite attractive , they had so much fun being together that they did not care about the others . \nthat they make their own outlandish clothes helped keep the wall around them . \ncomplementing romy and michele's lightness , is janeane garofalo as the dark , pudgy heather mooney . \nheather , who invented a new cigarette paper for cigarettes with \" twice the taste in half the time for the gal on the go , \" has the success and the money that they would like . \nheather was even more of an outsider than they were in high school . \ngarofalo's one-dimensional role is only a side show . \nthis is a two person film with the other characters there merely for the two leads to bounce their lines off of . \nthe genuine chemistry between sorvino and kudrow makes for a sweet and sometimes touching comedy . \nthey have so much fun acting out their parts , their enjoyment spreads to the audience . \n , \n", "martin scorsese's triumphant adaptation of edith wharton's the age of innocence is a stunning film for the quintessential new york filmmaker , the man who brought the streets of taxi driver and mean streets to life . \nit seems like an odd choice for scorsese to do a period piece in the early 1900's , but the fact that he pulls it off so brilliantly is a wonder , and a testament to the greatness of scorsese as a filmmaker . \nthis is a gorgeous visual experience that it surely one of scorsese's finest . \nnewland archer ( day-lewis ) is a prestigious lawyer who is engaged to may welland ( ryder ) , a somewhat empty and shallow new yorker , who belongs to a prestigious family and is quite beautiful . \nthe marriage is one which will unite two very prestigious families , in a society where nothing is more important than the opinions of others . \non the day that archer is to announce his engagement to may , countess ellen olenska ( pfeiffer ) , cousin of may , walks into archer's life . \narcher is immediately captivated , and finds himself in love with ellen . \narcher is also bound by the limits of new york society , which is an intrusive as any other in the world . \narcher finds himself having a secret love affair in his mind with countess olenska , attempting to keep her in his mind while trying not to lose his social status . \nthe film's subject matter may seem alien to scorsese , but the theme is definitely not . \nit is a theme of forbidden romance , guilty pleasures , and the consequences causes because of those actions . \nthere is a painstakingly flawed hero , and his choice between the life he wants , and the life he is destined for . \nin truth , it is a film about a society the audience doesn't know about , but wants to find out more , much like the society of goodfellas or even kundun . \nthe performances are absolutely breathtaking . \nday-lewis portrays more mental anguish in his face than one man should be forced to take . \npfeiffer is marvelous as countess olenska , a mix of passion and beauty that the audience would die for as well . \nryder is probably the gem of the group , for it is her quiet presence that overwhelms the plot , and slowly pushes day-lewis closer and closer to his eventual ending . \nthe supporting cast is also wonderful , with several characters so singular that they are indelible in one's memory . \nscorsese definitely has a passion for filmmaking . \nhis lavish and sumptuous set design and marvelous recreation of new york is a wondrous sight . \nhe literally transports the viewer to another world with incredible imagery . \nhis script is also excellent , slow in buildup , with a rapid conclusion and a fantastic ending that has to be seen to be believed . \nit is difficult to make a period piece gripping : scorsese , however , does it beautifully . \nthe famous cameras of the legendary director are also everywhere . \nhe is patient , but he films everything and anything remotely important . \nthe cameras sweep , pan , track , and do more than they've ever done , but they are so subtle , one doesn't realize he's watching all the scorsese hallmarks until a 2nd viewing . \nthe central tracking shot is probably longer and more complex than the famous goodfellas shot , but the viewer doesn't notice it , because we want to see more of this gorgeous world . \nthere are a few deft touches of filmmaking that are simply outstanding , and joanne woodward' narration is exquisite . \nnot a fast film like goodfellas , this shares more in common with kundun than anything else . \nand like kundun , this is a slow-starting film that truly shines , when given the chance to fully breathe and bloom in the end . \na beautiful film by a director continuing to challenge himself year after year . \n", "plot : a dude and his brother are driving cross-country and decide to fool around with a trucker on their cb radio . \nit isn't long before their little prank gets someone put into a coma

\nbut what's this . . . ? \nthe trucker is still on their tail and is now harassing all three of the young whippersnappers . . . ? \nyou bet ! \nbuckle up , dorothy . . . this is gonna be one bumpy ride ! \ncritique : a good ol' time at the movies ! \nhere's a film that actually gives away most of its plotline in its trailer and doesn't really bring anything \" new \" to the forefront ( if you've seen flicks like duel and breakdown , you've crossed this path before ) , but still manages to entertain you gangbusters , with realistic situations , believable characters , funny moments , thrills , chills , the whole shebang . \nlet's give it up for director john dahl , who continues to put out solid films every other year ( if you haven't seen red rock west , do yourself a favor right now , and jot it down on a piece of paper and rent it at your earliest convenience ) . \nand much like that film , this one has an excellent premise and sets everything up at an even pace . \nit gives you a little bit of background on each of the main three characters , and then shows you how one small prank , can lead to a whole lotta trouble for everyone ! \npaul walker really surprised me in this movie , since i've never much thought of him as anything more than a pretty face ( and damn , is it ever pretty or what ? ! ) \nbut here , he actually manages to put some depth behind the looks and that's always appreciated in films in which you are so closely tied to the main characters . \nsobieski is also good , but she isn't in the movie for as long as you'd think , but the man who really takes this film to another level , is steve zahn . \nif you've loved this guy as the \" goofball \" in most of his previous roles , you'll appreciate him even more here , as the dude who starts off as one of the most manic and excited human beings i've seen in quite some time ( \" this is so awesome ! ! \" ) , \nonly to turn into a man scared out of his wits by the end of the flick . \nand speaking of the ending , boy , does this movie deliver some chilling moments during its final 15 clicks or what ? ! ? \nthe arrow and i were practically in each others arms ( well , maybe i'm exaggerating , but you catch my drift ) as each minute brought about another turn of events which in turn , took it all to an even higher level . \nonce again , kudos to director dahl for being able to generate that type of intensity , suspense and tension , with a great score , editing , style and camerawork . \nplot-wise , i too did wonder how the \" bad guy \" was able to track them so well , but it didn't really bother me all that much ( you can assume that he had bugged their car ? ) . \nbut pretty much everything else in the story stuck like glue and i couldn't help but put myself in their shoes and appreciate their thoroughly desperate circumstance . \na great movie with an even cooler ending , this film will likely be remembered as one of the better thrillers of the year . \n \" this is amazing ! ! ! \" \nwhere's joblo coming from ? \namerican psycho ( 10/10 ) - deep blue sea ( 8/10 ) - eye of the beholder ( 4/10 ) - the fast and the furious ( 7/10 ) - final destination (

long for this epic-wannabe that plays more like a tv mini-series than a movie . \nthe story opens on the earp family farm , with young wyatt ready to run away from home . \nhe wants to fight in the civil war , but his dad ( hackman ) has different ideas and wants his son to study law . \ntime passes and wyatt heads west , returns home to marry , and , after a spell , begins his career in law enforcement . \nby the time he ( costner ) and his brothers ( madsen , david andrews , and linden ashby ) arrive in tombstone , wyatt has tried his hand at everything from hunting buffalo to dealing cards . \nwyatt earp is very appealing in places-- such as cast , costumes , and cinematography-- but an overstated story and overpowered score deaden most of the emotional impact . \nwho can be moved by scene after scene after scene of swelling strings and suffocating speeches ? \nsomber is fine-- just ask clint eastwood-- but this film that boasts not one , not two , but three , count 'em three , hammy death scenes ! \nstill , a little bit of earp goes a long way and the life and times of the legendary lawman are from uninteresting stuff . \nhis , uh , unusual relations with women , for example , are an intriguing contrast to his character's credo of \" nothing counts as much as blood . \" \nequally amusing is a buffalo-hunting ( and skinning ! ) \nsequence that is decidedly non-pc . \ndirector lawrence kasdan takes a refreshingly realistic approach to the gunplay . \nthe infamous gunfight at the ok corral is both brutal and brief , devoid of almost any theatrics . \ndon't look for much glorified violence here . \ndespite some large exclamation points in the story , the characters * do * come to life . \nthe diverse cast includes everyone from betty buckley ( ! ) to mackenzie astin ( ! ! ) . \nkevin costner is very good in the title role . \ndances with whitney nevers get as steely as the role requires , though , but his transformation from lighthearted law student to stoic sheriff is fun to watch . \nhe was tougher in a perfect world . \nhis foil is dennis quaid , who pulled a deniro by losing 40+ pounds to play the tubercular terror doc holliday . \ngaunt * and * gamely , he's a scene stealer who's seen too little . \nother familiar faces include tom sizemore ( looking like bruce mcgill ) , bill pullman ( looking like jeff daniels ) , and lea thompson ( looking like someone other than lea thompson ) . \nboth gene hackman and isabella rosselini appear and disappear like magic , while late entries catherine o'hara and jobeth williams are surprisingly solid . \nthough the story and score should've tried \" less is more , \" all other credits are technical tops . \nproduction designer ida random , art director gary wissner , and costume designer colleen atwood are some of the vips who helped spend what must've been an enormous budget . \nclearly no expense was spared . \n", "when i first heard that kevin costner was making a movie called \" the postman , \" i thought , \" an american version of 'il postino ? ' \nstarring costner ? \ngod help us ! \" \nwhen i found out that it was not a remake of \" postino \" but an postapocalyptic epic , i thought , \" 'landworld ? ' \nplease , god , make him stop ! \" \nas it turns out , \" the postman \" is a much better film than i had expected . \ndespite being set in 2013 , the movie is , at heart , a western : a band of thugs terrorizes peaceful villagers ; a wandering hero opposes the bandits and inspires others to fight back . \nthe setting , however , allows that familiar plot to take on greater significance : american society has collapsed due to plagues and wars , and survivors live behind barracades in isolated villages . \nthe struggle of a dead society to be reborn has a grand quality and deserves the epic scale costner grants it . \ncostner's nameless character , a wandering actor , rides in from the vast wasteland and is soon shanghaied into the service of general bethlehem ( will patton ) , a former copy-machine salesman turned bandit king . \nour hero escapes and discovers the body of a dead postman . \ntaking the uniform and bag of mail , he passes himself off as a representative of \" the restored united states . \" \nhe is shocked at the hope that he inspires in the people he meets . \none young disciple , ford lincoln mercury ( larenz tate ) , organizes a full-scale postal service . \nford spreads the postman's message of hope until bethlehem finds that the once-meek villagers are beginning to resist his rule . \nas war breaks out between bethlehem's army and the postal workers , costner's character steps into the legend he created and goes from self-centered loner to leader of the revolution . \nhis lie of the restored united states becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy . \n \" postman \" is an odd blend of a bleak setting and a message of wide-eyed optimism ( sort of \" sergio leone meets frank capra \" ) , but its treatment of hope and renewal is compelling . \nwhat could have been another knock-off of \" the road warrior \" ( like \" waterworld \" was ) surprises the viewer with a sensitively told story of nobility emerging from rubble . \ntate is the stand-out in the movie's large cast . \nford lincoln mercury ( self-named ) is the polar opposite of o-dog , tate's character in his debut film , \" menace ii society \" ( 1993 ) , and tate makes ford's innocent belief in hope as convincing as o-dog's cynicism and brutality . \nhis performance sells the movie . \ninterestingly , as tate moves from his usual street-smart roles to youthful optimism , the soft-eyed patton , who usually plays nice guys , proves a disarming villain . \nolivia williams makes her film debut as the postman's love interest , abby . \nwhen they first meet , abby asks him to father her child because her husband is sterile . \npredictably , the husband is soon eliminated by the bandits , and abby is thrown back into the company of the hero . \nhowever , their relationship develops slowly as the emotional conflicts of both characters are explored ( she , torn by grief , guilt , and anger ; he , resisting his destiny ) . \n \" the postman \" is costner's best work thus far . \nperhaps that alone gives us hope for the future . \n . \n . \n", "in zoolander , the world's most successful , influential and intellectually-challenged male model derek zoolander wonders , \" is there more to life than being really really really good looking ? \" \nobviously , the film's creator and star ben stiller asked a similar question when crafting a feature-length movie out of his hilarious vh1/vogue fashion awards short-film subject : can there be more to this film than being really really really silly ? \nno , of course not , and it never aspires to be anything more . \nmuch like derek , zoolander is a sweet simpleton of a movie . \nit's not complex in either its social commentary or its comedy , and it never produces any gut-busting laughs ( except maybe a scene when derek's model roommates all die in a tragic \" gasoline fight \" accident -- a riotously funny take-off of tommy hilfiger ads ) . \nbut it has a satisfying handful of strong chuckles , wild characters and performances , and mildly harsh potshots at the fashion industry to keep you amused . \nbetter yet , this exaggerated version of the original three-minute skit is only blown out to an efficient 95 minutes -- just enough time to string together its goofball plot without exhausting the gag . \nzoolander opens with several fashion bigwigs plotting to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia , since he wants to abolish child labor in his country and thus driving up their costs . \nfashion designer and criminal mastermind jacobim mugatu ( will ferrell ) drafts a plan to brainwash the dumbest fashion model to carry out the evil deed . \nenter derek , whose career is slumping as newcomer hansel ( owen wilson ) takes the spotlight . \non the trail of mugatu's plot is time magazine reporter matilda jeffries ( stiller's real-life wife christine taylor ) , and she's hoping to use mugatu's pawn derek to ultimately foil the scheme . \nmuch like the austin powers films , zoolander relies heavily on the strength of the talent involved , and this zany comedy features some of the funniest people in entertainment today . \nwilson is hysterical as the young , vain hansel . \nferrell nearly steals the show from everyone as the flamboyant , freakish mugatu in the same way dr . evil upstages everyone in austin powers . \njerry stiller -- ben's dad who's best remembered as frank costanza of seinfeld -- makes a priceless turn as derek's slimy agent maury ballstein . \neven ben stiller show alum andy dick shows up as a deranged , large-assed masseuse . \nas for ben stiller , it seems his derek has one gag : he's stupid , which plays out in some uproarious one-liners . \nunfortunately , taylor seems out of place and out of her league here . \nmaybe it's just because i can't stop seeing her as marcia brady ( who she played in both brady movies ) , making her unbelievable as a dowdy , brainy plain jane who hasn't had sex in two years . \nshe leaves me pining for the cynicism of janeane garofolo , who would've added real comic substance to the flimsy role . \nwhile zoolander is hardly highbrow , its screwball humor is welcome during these trying times , especially considering the gross lack of decent pickings in the theaters these days . \nzoolander's no masterpiece , but a very worthy distraction . \n", "originally titled 'don't lose your head' , this parody of the scarlet pimpernel story was the first carry on to be produced by rank film productions . \ntwo english fops , the 'powdered , be-wigged , be-ribboned' sir rodney ffing ( sidney james ) and his counterpart lord darcy pew ( jim dale ) decide to travel to revolutionary france in an attempt to rescue their fellow french royalists and aristocrats from losing their heads by the guillotine . \ndue to a series of machinations and disguises , they are largely successful . \nffing becomes known as 'the black fingernail' because he leaves a calling card behind which shows two fingers sticking up , one with a black fingernail . \nafter the fingernail rescues a prominent royalist the duc de pommfrit ( charles hawtrey ) , citizen robespierre ( peter gilmore ) orders the head of the secret police citizen 'the big cheese' camembert ( kenneth williams ) and citizen bidet ( peter butterworth ) to follow the fingernail to england and do away with him . \n ( in fact , darcy and ffing are their coachmen ! ) \nonce at calais , the fingernail meets jacqueline ( dany robin ) and they fall in love instantly . \nhe tells her his identity and gives her his locket . \nwhen camembert realises that the fingernail is nearby , he searches the inn at calais and captures jacqueline , thinking that she is wearing a diguise and is

to be of noble stock , calling themselves the duc and duchesse de la plume de ma tante ( with bidet their assistant ) and are invited by darcy to a ball held by ffing . \ndesiree finds out that ffing is the fingernail by wearing the locket around her neck , but she ends up falling in love with him . \nffing attempts to stall camembert so that he can return to the bastille to rescue jacqueline , camembert has her moved to the 'chateau neuve' , and a climactic sword-fight decides who will lose their heads at the end of the film ! \na more complex story than most carry ons , this film enjoys good production values ( sets , costumes ) and an on-form cast . \nsid james is excellent as the english fop and black fingernail , kenneth williams excels as the evil camembert , and peter butterworth expertly plays the substantial part of camembert's thick-witted crony . \nother acting honours go to joan sims who is perfect as desiree and charles hawtrey who is excellent as the french aristo pommfrit . \nalthough it suffers from a disasterously over-long sword fight at the end of the film , it is largely successful due to the performances of the main stars , its slick and professional production , and its better-than-usual script . \ndefinitely one of the best of the series and a joy to watch . \n", "if there is one thing that bothers me about hollywood films it's their predictable endings . \nthe devil's advocate has the atypical hollywood ending , when everything that should happen does . \nunfortunately for the devil's advocate , this ending nearly collapses in on itself , and ruins the entire film . \nnevertheless , the film does provide two and a half hours of pure entertainment ( note to self : kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film ) . \ni don't think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan . \nwell , it does contain this element , but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements ( and seemingly more interesting ones at that ) . \nthe devil's advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session . \nkevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is the defense attorney , working for a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl . \nhe ends up with a not-guilty verdict , despite an emotional testimony from the victim ( heather matarazzo ) . \nhe leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann ( charlize theron ) where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury . \nhe accepts ( mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive ) and he flies to new york with his wife . \nafter proving his worth for selecting juries ( and his perfect winning streak in court ) , the head of the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) , asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer . \nhe graciously accepts , where he is treated almost as a god . \nhe is given an incredible apartment ( which is bigger than my entire house now ) , and a hefty paycheck . \nhis life seems to be on the rise . \nand of course , his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline . \nhe is attracted to fellow employee christabella ( connie nielson ) , and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment . \nmary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice , especially if it is not wanted . \nmeanwhile , kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen ( craig t . nelson ) who apparently murdered three people . \nhe spends hours upon hours with this case , while forgetting his loving wife , who may or may not be going insane . \nall of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself . \nafter a while , things turn completely upside-down , as kevin's wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends . \na fellow employee is murdered in the park , and his mother ( judith ivey ) reveals information about kevin's real father . \nis it all just a big nightmare ? \nor is john milton really satan , playing tricks with kevin's life ? \nthe devil's advocate plays out fairly straight-forward , but for some odd reason , the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we don't expect . \nis this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed ? \nif so , the devil's advocate messes up completely , and ironically , i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now , than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early . \ni went into the devil's advocate expecting a shocking horror film , and that is exactly what i got . \ni was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally , and that is what i got . \nbut what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending ( did i mention that i didn't like the ending ? ) . \nthe producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending , they pull the rug out from under you . \nfilms like se7en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected , more or less . \nwe know it is going to end in an unpredictable way . \nthe devil's advocate , on the other hand , ends unpredictably , not from us knowing a lot , but knowing nothing at all . \nif that is confusing , i recommend watching the film , and then reading that again . \nas for the film overall , i enjoyed the entire first two hours , being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study . \nthe film runs like a well-built clock , slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax ( and an unpredictable one at that ) . \nand then you settle in for a nice resolution , which does not occur . \nit was at this point that i felt cheated . \ntaking us on a terror ride of intrigue , we follow kevin lomax around , as he is the centerpiece of the film . \neverything occurs from his perspective . \nhe is our representation on screen ( sort of ) . \nbut we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game . \ni don't want to spoil the ending , so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself . \nperhaps the most shocking thing about the devil's advocate is the extreme amount of everything . \nit earned its r rating for a reason . \nthere is plenty of nudity , sex , violence , gore , and then you have gore , violence , sex , and more nudity . \nthis film really isn't subtle about anything , showing us everything . \nit actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc-17 rating , as it is quite harsh . \nhowever , the movie does have its merits , and nudity and sex are among those . \ni don't condone sex and nudity in films , but if its there , i might as well enjoy it . \nthe biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch . \nthe confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining , but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife , mary ann . \nportrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron , mary ann's problems are incredibly intense , and i found myself wanting to witness her decline . \nthis may sound uncaring , but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her . \nshe is the most interesting character on the screen , who is forced into a world where she is not wanted . \nsomething the devil's advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity , especially for a film of this nature . \nthe story actually has something to say about humanity . \nin one of the last scenes , john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children ( he is satan , of course ) . \nhe comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity . \nthen , god sets up rules which contradict human nature . \nthis semi-religious bashing is more humorous than frightening . \nwhat milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud , partially thinking it was funny , but patially realizing it was true . \nthese moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil's advocate , giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing ( but i'm sure they came straight from the novel it was based on ) . \nwhen a film has something to say about our society , it deserves to be watched . \nthe cast of the devil's advocate is one of the highlights , as we see memorable faces , and they put spins on those memorable faces we don't expect . \nheather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case , and she does a great job . \nprobably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves . \nhe has proven himself an uneven actor ( successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic ) , but he tops himself with this performance . \ni have never seen him more believable to date . \nal pacino is of course the scene stealer . \nhis devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson ( the witches of eastwick ) and max von sydow ( needful things ) . \nhe could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes , but he remains completely believable ( if that is the correct term ) . \njeffrey jones ( mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller's day off ) also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon . \njudith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevin's past . \nconnie nielson is very effective in her role , and she also appears naked several times . \none familiar face with a twist was \" coach \" star , craig t . nelson , who gives a very good performance . \nthe devil's advocate is rated r for sexuality , nudity , violence , language , and some gore . \nat 144 minutes , this film moves along fairly quickly . \nfor the first two hours , i sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters . \nthe technical quality is also remarkable , with great special effects and a good musical score . \ndirector taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture , only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes . \ni guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film , and hackford gave me just that for a long time . \nbut just before the end , he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream . \npersonally , i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early . \n", "ingredients : down-on-his-luck evangelist , church \nsynopsis : sonny dewey ( robert duvall ) is a tireless texas pentecostal preacher who unexpectedly catches his wife ( farrah fawcett ) in bed with another guy . \nin a regrettable crime of passion he takes a baseball bat to the guy's head , and suddenly finds himself a fugitive for murder , and estranged from his wife and two kids . \nto atone for his sins , sonny flees to a rural bayou town in louisiana and baptizes himself as a new creature - - the apostle e . f . as the apostle e . f . sonny's main mission is to revive an abandoned church community and preach the gospel at the local radio station . \nsoon he sets about resurrecting the one way road to heaven holiness temple . \nbut sonny knows his time is short ; one day the police will find him . \nopinion : this movie is a thought-provoking look at an evangelist in real life terms . \ni believe that robert duvall ( who is the producer , director , writer , and main star of the apostle ) deserves an oscar for his performance as sonny the religious crusader - - a performance which is so complex and realistic it ranks as one of the finest acting performances on film . \nduvall's portrayal of a true believer is authentic , superb , and inspired ; it offers the audience a completely honest look at southern religion , as well as a portrait of a fallible , complicated man driven by his beliefs . \nincidentally , in real life duvall was just as 'driven' in getting the project underway . \nsince no major hollywood studio wanted to risk financing a complex movie about an evangelist , the apostle as a project lay dormant for almost 13 years before duvall was able to get it done , paying for its production with his own money ( about five million dollars ) . \nin terms of hard-hitting realism and character portrayal the apostle would rank as one of the best movies of this decade , and i emphatically recommend the apostle for connoisseurs of stage and fine acting on film . \nsimilarly , those with a steep background in pentecostal christianity would find the apostle a thought-provoking experience . \non the other hand , the apostle's main strength - - duvall's preaching - - is also what limits the apostle's target audience . \nin terms of plot and pure entertainment value , the apostle is definitely not for everyone . \nteenagers , action fans , comedy fans , and people who find church completely boring should stay far away from this movie , since three quarters of the film is watching sonny preach at church . \nin other words , the apostle is a four star performance , but with a very limited audience . \n", "the most amazing thing about paul cox's innocence is how unlike a movie it is . \ni mean that as the highest compliment . \nif most studios were to profile an elderly couple who rekindle a 40-year-old romance , i'd want to run and hide . \nthe sex scenes would be handled as a farce , producers would shed 20 years off the characters' ages ( so susan sarandon and harrison ford could star ) and true love would shine through any obstacle without explanation and consequence . \nalong with a charming romantic story , the australian/belgian innocence shows how an increasing sense of mortality combined with revisiting the past while being entrenched in the present can make something that seems so right seem downright questionable . \nthe romance gets started when former musician andreas ( charles \" bud \" tingwell ) , learns that his true love , claire ( julia blake ) , lives nearby . \nthey decide to catch up on old times , but soon find themselves in a reinvigorating affair . \ncomplicating matters is andreas' frail health , and claire's longtime husband ( terry norris ) , who can't understand why he's suddenly become obsolete . \nin my mind , the movie is less about the relationship between andreas and claire , than the feelings of everyone involved . \njohn , claire's husband , endlessly questions what he did wrong . \nclaire initially insists she's a grown-up , but admittedly behaves like a child , a prospect that thrills and disappoints her . \nandreas , an agnostic , begins to question his fate , a message cox delivers in a memorable dream sequence . \ncox litters the movie with flashbacks , including the repeated vision of a roaring train . \nit's a reminder of andreas and claire's past love ( as young lovers , they met by train ) , but as it recurs , we get the feeling that the past and the present have clashed . \na pall is cast on the whole affair . \na master of the understated , cox strings together a series of memorable moments . \nin andreas' dream sequence , amidst the roar of the train and conversations , we get the whole picture of andreas and claire's love . \nwe also get glimpses into john and claire's relationship . \nduring a silent candlelit dinner shortly afterward , claire admits to john about her indiscretion , telling more than any monologue could . \nall that's heard is the scraping of forks against plates . \nthe characters are unlike anything i've seen -- they're people . \nso many times , movies and especially television portray senior citizens as gratingly spunky . \nor they're reduced to comedic buffoons . \nordinary people with a pile of emotions , claire and andreas aren't sure what the next step is . \nthey do want to be happy , which consists of an entirely different set of conditions than what they've known throughout their adult lives . \nbravo to cox , who wrote the script , for not making john a monster , so that claire's affair is automatically justified . \nnorris is so effective as john that he makes andreas and claire's love difficult to accept . \nwe feel for him . \nhe's a decent man . \nsure , he may have become complacent , but he never expected this , especially now . \nwith so much presented to the audience , it's only expected that the material gets a little drawn out and repetitive , which it does . \nhowever , in bringing up tough questions and not offering easy answers , cox displays a skill and ? lan isn't likely to be surpassed by anyone anytime soon . \n", "contact is a film that tries to do several different things . \nit is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like , to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life , to raise questions about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such a situation , and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr . ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) and the religious spokesman palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) . \nthe film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals . \nthe portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable ( albeit less immediately engaging ) than , say , the cold-blooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tv's the x-files . \nthe aliens in contact seem to be like us-they are more curious than anything else . \nthey know we exist , they want us to know that they exist , and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person . \nthe film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly , and between the characters' ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world , that sense of wonder and mystery comes through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubrick's 2001 : a space odyssey . \nmost of the film , however , takes place on earth , where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens . \nscientists are enthusiastic , ultraconservative religious leaders are wary , and government officials are caught somewhere in between . \nthe debate is fueled largely by dr . arroway's atheism ; she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens have provided blueprints , but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankind's representative to another species . \nthe film is partly successful in raising and exploring these questions , especially when it reaches a conclusion that suggests that the two approaches - science and faith - could be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed . \nstill , the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society . \nthe two \" sides \" are represented primarily by arroway and by far-right fundamentalists , but in reality probably 80% of americans are neither atheists nor far-right fundamentalists . \npalmer joss occupies something of a middle ground , but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives and comes across as a less-than-ideal spokesman for any ideology . \nthen again , the film does concentrate mostly on public debate , which does , after all , tend to be dominated by extremists , rather than on dinner-table or college-dormitory discussions . \ncontact is accurate in its portrayal of these issues , then , but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself . \nthe film's one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway and joss . \nfor one thing , it resorts to the tired movie clich * that two attractive people will immediately fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen together , as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction . \nthe romance rarely , if ever , sheds any light on the characters , although it occasionally tries and fails - joss's explanation that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement ( \" i guess you could say i'm a man of the cloth , but without the cloth \" ) , for example , is more like a punchline to a joke than character development . \ninstead , the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot developments . \ngranted , this is a plot- and idea-driven film and the characters are secondary , but this just seemed like laziness on the writers' part more than anything else . \nthe successes of contact , however , far outweigh its failures . \neven if the social commentary had fizzled altogether ( which it didn't ) , the simple yet mysterious story of alien communication still would have made it a memorable film . \ncontact doesn't quite cover all the bases , but it covers about as much as one could hope for in a two-hour film , and its rejection of big-budget theatrics for a more realistic story is certainly admirable . \nand i would not be surprised if , ten years from now , contact is mentioned in the same breath as 2001 and blade runner as one of the finest examples of sophisticated and intellectually relevant science fiction . \n", "billy bob thornton , who had a sudden rise to fame with 1996's sling blade after spending years as a virtually unknown actor and writer , is becoming one of the most versatile - and most accomplished - american actors around at the moment . \nas jacob , the simple but at times very bright loser brother of bill paxton's hank , thornton gives a performance which should leave an indelible mark on all but the most hardened viewers . \nthree men , hank ( paxton ) , jacob ( thornton ) and their friend lou ( brent briscoe ) stumble upon a plane wreck which , upon closer inspection , yields a rotting corpse and a bag full of money . \njacob and lou want to pocket the cash . \nhank , the smarter - and perhaps more naive - of the three , insists on leaving the money for the authorities to find . \neventually , they agree to keep the cash safe until the plane is found , and then split the money three ways . \nthings start going wrong , though , with greed and violence weaving their ways through their plan . \ndisaster is sure to strike . \ndirector sam raimi , of the evil dead and darkman fame , has made an excellent and thought-provoking film , worlds away from the comic horror films which made his name . \nwhile there are a couple of moments which might remind one of his earlier work , raimi has made an intelligent and mature departure which will hopefully be a sign of even greater films to come . \nscott b . smith's screenplay , based on his novel ( which i haven't read ) is a fine example of escalating tension . \nwhile it does remind one of danny boyle's shallow grave without the abundance of black humour , it keeps the drama that should really be a part of such a story on morality , or the lack thereof , found in a film with this subject matter . \nalar kivilo's cinematography reminds one of joel and ethan coen's fargo , with the bleak , snowy landscape almost becoming another character . \ndanny elfman also does well with his moody , finely-written score . \nif there's a flaw in the film , it's that it goes on for just a little too long . \njust when we think that they are about to wrap things up , raimi and smith decide to let the film go on a little further . \nwhile this isn't really a bad thing , it did become a little frustrating at times ( this may have been due to the fact that i had consumed a large sprite beforehand ) . \nthe performances are excellent , with the usually annoying paxton in fine form and bridget fonda giving a scene-stealing turn as hank's scheming wife . \nthis is an excellent showcase for thornton's fine skills as an actor and a great change in direction for raimi , who could very well have a career ahead of him as an accomplished director of dramatic films . \nfingers crossed , though , that this doesn't stop him from making another evil dead sequel . \n", "tibet has entered the american consciousness slowly during the past few years and burst into the forefront recently . \nthe dalai lama has made speaking tours , tibetan designs and artifacts are showing up in shops , the plight of the people has captured the imagination of major actors and artists and now there are two big budget films within as many months . \n \" kundun \" ( \" presence \" , a name the monks call the young dalai lama ) opens in 1937 with the search for the 14th incarnation of the tibetan leader . \na group of monks enters a village and a two-year-old child catches their attention . \nthe young boy proves himself by identifying possessions of the previous holy man as \" mine \" . \nhe and his family are then moved to a monastery in lhassa where he is to be prepared to take his position as the religious and political leader of the country . \nhe is forced into difficult decisions when china invades the country in 1950 . \nthe peaceful and isolated country is ill-equipped to fight off the intruders and diplomatic attempts over the next years yield no results . \neventually he must make the painful choice to flee to neighboring india . \ncomparisons to \" seven years in tibet \" are inevitable . \nboth films cover much of the same ground although the earlier movie does so from a westerner's point of view and features boxoffice draw brad pitt . \n \" kundun \" features only native actors and is more of an insider's story . \nin some ways , this makes this film a superior concept , but it lacks the movement and spark that made \" seven years \" such an audience-pleaser . \nthe actors contribute to the realistic feel of the movie ( filmed in morocco for obvious reasons ) . \nthe only disappointment is chairman mao who looks like a wax dummy and moves as if he were a computer-generated character . \non an intellectual level , it is interesting to see how two different approaches handle the same facts . \nsome events are depicted differently and pitt's austrian mountain-climber who was portrayed as a pivotal influence in the dalai lama's life isn't even mentioned here . \nglossed over in \" seven years \" , the problems with the tibetan political system is hinted at here as the dalai lama muses \" we were just about to change things \" after the chinese attack . \nthe film is magnificently beautiful thanks primarily to the cinematography of roger deakins . \nhis lingering camera shows the exotic tibetan culture with luscious detail . \nespecially striking is an extreme moving close up of a sand mandala grain by grain . \nthe visual treats more than make up for the movie's faults creating a poetic meditation for the audience . \nwalking out of the theater you feel like you have awakened from a transcendental experience . \nmartin scorsese , known for his dark tales of the underworld ( \" goodfellas \" , \" taxi driver \" , \" casino \" ) has shifted gears . \nsomething of a thematic follow-up to his \" the last temptation of christ \" , this is his slowest film yet . \noddly enough for a director with a history of graphic violence presenting a history filled with atrocities by the chinese , most of these events take place off-screen . \nhis decision to not over-explain rituals is commendable . \nthe stumbling oracle who spits out his prophecies while in a trance state is much more effective as a mystery than if we were spoon-fed interpretations . \nphilip glass's score is impressive although at times it is too overwhelming and distracting . \ni talked to a tibetan i met outside the theater who had just seen the film and was walking back in to see it again . \nhearing his description of how he escaped from tibet at the age of seven and how his father was one of the soldiers accompanying the dalai lama during his trip to india , i was struck by what was missing in the movie . \nas grand as it looks and as historically accurate as it is , there is a distance between the audience and the movie . \nthe film is more concerned with visuals and history and less so with human beings . \nwith the exception of a few scenes , involvement with the characters is slight . \none of those exceptions is the portrayal of the young dalai lama , shown as a mischievous boy who can't resist being a kid sometimes . \nan encounter with his older brother thubten j . norbu ( a retired indiana university professor ) who tells the young leader the chinese have ordered him to persuade him to accept communist rule or kill him is an outstanding moment , but there aren't many of these . \neven with its problems , the \" kundun \" experience is phenomenal , but one that i fear most will miss . \nmany people who saw \" seven years in tibet \" will have a \" been there , done that \" attitude . \nit's likely that the film will miss a wide-spread appeal and public response will be the sound of one hand clapping . \n", "i swear i have seen the edge before . \nin fact , it reminded me of the bear , the river wild , and other various films mixed into an entirely different film . \nhowever , the edge has done something that most action films should do , and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot . \nin doing so , the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than , say , the peacemaker . \nunfortunately , because of those overused moments , we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film . \nbut leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head . \none surprise , in particular , left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script . \naction films are a dime a dozen in hollywood , and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us , they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre : intelligence . \neven horror films have learned this , a genre which is probably the least respected of them all . \nthe river wild was one of the best action/suspense films i have seen from the 90s . \nthe intelligence of the screenplay , and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day . \nthe edge has the intelligence and smart characters , but this time the lack of originality is the downfall . \ni must admit that it was very suspenseful , and had an original third half , but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes . \nthis is an example of the final act saving the film , instead of the other way around ( as in the lost world ) . \nif only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes' intensity , it could have become a great action film ( and i use the term loosely ) . \nthe edge is pretty much a survival-of-the-fittest film . \nbut taking scream's lead , the edge makes fun of the genre's cliches , and then uses them ( though not quite as effectively ) . \ncharles morse ( anthony hopkins ) is the main character , a rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him . \nfor once , we don't immediately care for the main character . \ninstead , we like bob ( alec baldwin ) , a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles' wife , mickey ( elle macpherson ) , out in the wilderness . \nthey board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic . \ncharles' birthday is the same day , and he receives a gold watch from his wife , and a pocket knife from bob . \nas action films go , these items do have importance to the rest of the story , but quite a bit more than we first expect . \nsoon , however , bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures of because of his \" personality . \" \ncharles , bob , bob's assistant steve ( harold perrineau ) , and the pilot head off to find him , and as shown in the previews , hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter . \ndown the plane goes , the pilot is killed , and the three are left to survive in the wilderness . \ndirector lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow , and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations . \nhe succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film . \ntake , for instance , the entire man-hunting bear plot . \nthis has been done many times in films with different animals , and even bears . \nbut given the charles' intelligence , and bob's uncertainty , many of the cliches are given fresh twists . \neven charles himself seems to have seen these action films before . \nmy favorite line of the film comes from charles : \" most people die in the wilderness because they didn't do the one thing that could save their life . . . \nthinking . \" \ndespite the predictability of the main plot , a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise , and made me smile when i realized that everything isn't as it seems anymore . \ni have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise , so instead i will avoid it entirely . \nthe first two-thirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along , and some of charles' survival techniques seem possible , even making fire from ice . \ntamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear , but whenever the bear is present , the characters lose all sensibility . \ni have always wondered why characters in films walk over a log to get across water . \nwhy not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across ? \ni guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while . \nthankfully , we already have begun to care for the characters , and so we let this small detail slide . \nbut some of the technical details are awkward , such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make ( where did they get thread and needles ? ) . \nthe acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature , and borders on phenomenal . \nanthony hopkins gives a terrific performance , creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day . \nhopkins usually brings greatness to his roles , but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences' sympathy , something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs . \nalec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen ( it sure is better from his fair game ) . \nbaldwin can be a good or a bad character , and here he succeeds at both in a way . \nyou can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end , and baldwin is able to handle the double-natured photographer . \nelle macpherson gives a good performance , albeit slight . \nshe isn't in the film all that much , but for the scenes she does have , she handles as an actress , not as a model . \nharold perrineau is a good actor , and his scenes are nice and underplayed . \nhe is eliminated early , and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable . \nthe edge is rated r for graphic violence , some gore , and language . \nsome of the violence is a little too disturbing , even for me . \nthis film is a nice change from the mindless action most of us are used to , but too many cliches bog it down . \ndirector tamahori has created a very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts . \ndavid mamet's script , though , has a lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat , and the acting is solid . \nthe best thing about the script is the ending which doesn't end with the normal high-strung action sequence , but with a small detail involving a certain gift . \nit's a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear . \nand by the way , most people laughed when the film faded to black due to a large credit to bart the bear . \nway to go , bart . \n", "one of the more unusual and suggestively violent films ever made , \" se7en \" is just a few steps away from brilliance . \nhowever , those few steps away are only a few steps from a level of evil and depravity that few people want to discuss . \nthe film received mixed reviews upon release , but there's an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue to this that many critics perhaps did not notice . \nat times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing , but the script and the ultimate pay-off are excellent . \nthe shocking conclusion is just as unpredictable as the endings of most films are predictable . \nthis piece of work is 100% intensity . \nit's uncomfortable to watch , yet compelling . \n \" i want not to look , yet i cannot turn away . \" \nthe story creeps along slowly and deliberately , crafted by visionary director david fincher . \nhe has experience in tantalizing his audience with information and visions , but not giving away too much too soon . \nthis is the guy who directed the ominous \" alien 3 \" . \n \" se7en \" is even more ominous because the threat is real . \nit's human and , while the script takes some artistic licence , the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic . \nthat is , if a human being could be so intelligent , patient , wealthy , and disillusioned . \nafter the most bizarre opening credits i've ever seen ( refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment ) , the initial character development takes place . \nmorgan freeman stars as detective william somerset , a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the sickness of society . \nbrad pitt co-stars as detective david mills , the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full of fury to catch the bad guys . \nthese two fine actors give the film its human qualities ( along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow , who plays tracy , mills' wife ) . \nhowever , none of them stands out above the material . \nno disrespect intended , but two other actors could have played these parts and the film probably would have been about the same . \nan ironic note is that somerset has only a week ( or 7 , that's seven , days ) left on the force to train his young protege . \nthe title of the picture also refers to the 7 deadly sins , as chronicled by john milton in \" paradise lost \" --gluttony , greed , sloth , lust , pride , envy , & wrath . \nincidentally , i wrote the sins in order of how each victim was found . \nit's the last two sins that are the most intriguing and shocking , but i won't give that away . \nas i said , this has a great ending and no one should spoil it . \nanyway , the brilliant killer sets out to make a statement to the world that these sins will no longer be tolerated and he makes the \" sinners \" suffer for it . \nthe two partners stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man . \nthey learn that he was murdered--forced to eat himself to death . \nthe killer leaves small clues at this and other murders and , of course , somerset and mills are smart enough to stay with him all the way . \nif they didn't , it would be one short movie ! \nthe deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail and story . \nwe see a lot of blood , but it's not especially violent . \nthe suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything actually shown--like most of the violence in \" pulp fiction \" . \n \" se7en \" is gory , graphic , and disturbing , but all the gore is post-death . \nstill , if you tend to get queasy , don't eat food during this film . \nkevin spacey plays john doe , the avenging angel who claims that he's the messenger who will right the wrongs with his teachings . \nlike many crazy men , he has some fine ideas , but some sick ways of expressing himself . \nspacey doesn't appear until the final 30 minutes and also doesn't receive billing in the opening credits . \nhowever , it's his appearance that turns this film upside down and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomination . \na great villain manages to make you either root for him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings regardless of whether you agree with him or not . \nthis character is so well written that it's hard to disagree when he says that what he is doing will be remembered by everyone . \nno serial killer has ever been so creative . \n \" se7en \" is blatantly unsubtle with its messages about the horrors of the world and it's often a little too depressing . \nwhat it lacks in those areas , it makes up for with believable dialogue , top-notch screenwriting , unexpected twists , and realistic characters . \nthe technical aspects of the film are unobtrusive . \nfincher uses lighting , music , and editing quite well , but his story is always the thrust of the film . \nfortunately , we don't find out what happens to mills and somerset after the closing credits ( which are run backwards up the screen ! ) . \nit's better to imagine what paths they will follow . \nthis is not the kind of film you turn away from and quickly forget . \nit's got a sinister message and john doe is right about one thing--the evils of the world aren't going to cure themselves . \n \" se7en \" raises some tough questions and it's intelligent enough to allow its audience to answer many of those questions for themselves . \nuseless trivia--co-stars in 1995's \" se7en \" , brad pitt and kevin spacey also competed for the 1995 best supporting actor oscar--pitt in \" 12 monkeys \" , spacey in \" the usual suspects \" ( for which he won ) . \n", "there are some works of art that are almost impossible to review , not because of their own complexity , but because of their legendary status which prevents the reviewer to say anything original . \none of such masterpieces is casablanca , probably not the best film in the history of the seventh art , but definitely the most popular one . \nits popularity can be measured not in a multitude of more or less disguised remakes that were made in more than half a century since its premiere , but also in countless tributes and references that movie makers use in their works to this day . \ncasablanca is also a movie that has the very rare virtue of both being praised by the critics and loved by general audience . \none of the things that makes this film even more unique was the fact that it was doomed to fail , at least judging by conventional movie-making wisdom of its time . \nit was based on a broadway play so mediocre that it hadn't been produced on stage ; screenplay by three writers - julius g . epstein , philip j . epstein and howard koch - was beeing written as shooting went along ; the main actors were producers' second choice , and , finally , man behind camera , michael curtiz was considered to be capable , but not great director . \nhowever , the movie was commercially successful and earned three \" oscars \" , including the one for the best film . \nuntil this very day , it is considered to be the best example of hollywood film- making in its own golden age . \nthe plot of the movie was heavily influenced by the needs of ww2 propaganda , yet it also used rather complicated and now almost forgotten political circumstances of that global conflict in order to make intriguing story . \nin december 1941 , casablanca , exotic port on the atlantic coast of north africa is controlled by officially neutral , yet nazi-collaborating french vichy government . \nthousands of refugees from war-torn europe are stuck there on the way to lisbon and safety of america , and ready to pay any price for precious exit visas . \nmany shady characters thrive on their misery , including the corrupt police chief , captain renault ( rains ) . \nhis best friend is rick blaine ( bogart ) , who used to be idealistic anti-fascist , and now owns popular night club in casablanca and lives by his own cynical philosophy of \" sticking his neck for nobody \" . \nhowever , everything changes when he gets in possession of two precious extra visas . \nthis event coincides with the arrival of two new refugees to casablanca . \none of them is victor laszlo ( henreid ) , czech resistance leader who escaped three times from nazi concentration camps and became the legend of enslaved europe . \nhe is accompanied by his beautiful wife ilsa lund ( bergman ) , with whom rick had a stormy affair in the eve of nazi occupation of paris . \nthe couple needs visas , especially because of the gestapo major strasser ( veidt ) being on their trail . \nrick is now forced to choose between love , wounded pride , self-preserving interest and his own hatred of fascism . \nthe casting for this movie seems influenced by divine inspiration - humphrey bogart , most legendary actor in the history of cinema , is one of the rare character actors who elevated his persona to the star status . \nbogart's portrayal of rick as complicated man , torn between idealistic past and bitter present , was so perfect , that his icon would forever be connected with that character . \nanother icon in his company is ingrid bergman , great actress of old hollywood , here in her artistic and visual prime . \nthe cinematic coupling of bogart and bergman became one of the main symbols of that era of filmmaking - some happier times when the romance on the screen didn't look childish nor trite like in some more contemporary works . \nfor many people , casablanca is probably the best romantic film ever made . \nbut the reason for that isn't the romance itself - it's the realistic story of people forced to make tough , and often wrong choices in their life . \nthe casting of casablanca was right on target not just in a case of main leads . \nthe supporting actors also did a marvellous job . \nsidney longstreet and peter lorre were here mainly to give a mystic flavour spotted in a previous bogart classic - john huston's maltese falcon ; yet both of them managed to portray colourful and original characters . \nanother shining example of good casting is now almost forgotten paul henreid as the weakest part of love triangle ; character of victor laszlo has believable charisma and looks like a somebody who could inspire millions of people to rise against nazi tiranny . \nunfortunately , the charisma that burdened laszlo , leaves little place for difficult choice , making his character forever overshadowed by rick/ilsa coupling . \nhowever , rick and ilsa actually have a serious competiton for most memorable character in casablanca . \ncaptain renault , brilliantly portrayed by claude rains in a role of a lifetime , was embodiment of perfect , almost unmatched balance between ethical corruption and physical charm . \ndespite being the undoubtful villain in almost entire movie , rains managed to make renault sympathetic character , and his final conversion to the side of good , symbolized in not so subtle gesture at the end of movie looked unnecessary . \nrains also gave another dimension to the movie , making it even more ambiguous ; people who like to analyse movies to death discovered signs of homosexuality in renault's relationship towards rick , and rick's final words leave room for even more outrageous speculations . \ntogether with well-drawn characters and exciting story , the movie was good in creating his own atmosphere . \nprofessional nitpickers would probably have a field day in discovering numerous historical and geographical inaccuracies , but casablanca is still a shining example of hollywood ww2 movie that is beliavable , if not realistic . \nany way , even if we don't see it as a historical document , casablanca is movie that can be source of entertainment as well as infinite inspiration . \n", "like the great musical pieces of mozart himself , amadeus is a true work of art . \nit is one of those few movies of the 80's that will be known for its class , its style , and its intelligence . \nwhy is this such a good film ? \nthere are almost too many reasons to explain . \nthe story : court composer salieri ( f . \nmurray abraham ) feels waves of different emotions going through his head as wolfgang amadeus mozart ( tom hulce ) comes into his life as the young genius composer . \nsalieri feels envy , and jealousy , but at the same time is fascinated with mozart's brilliance and ingenious . \nwe travel through mozart's life as a composer , through his struggles , his triumphs , and ultimately , his demise . \nthe acting : abraham is magnificient as salieri ; his acting range enables him to focus on each individual emotion and express it through his speech and body language . \nthis performance earned him a well deserved oscar . \ntom hulce is interesting as well as mozart , a quirky , annoying bratty kid with an annoying laugh . \nhe's strong , but weak at the same time , and must be aided by his wife ( elizabeth berridge ) , who is good in her role , but lacks dramatic depth . \njeffrey jones , in a smaller , more dignified role than such roles in stay tuned and mom and dad save the world , is cast perfectly because of his noble charm . \nthe movie : every element of this movie works . \nthe costumes and makeup are very memorable , as well as its stunning art direction , and unforgettable scores ( adapted from mozart's original music ) . \nwhile wolfgang amadeus mozart was a genius at music , milos forman proves with his film that he is a genius of filmmaking . \nthis movie is a classic that will be remembered for years to come . \nad2am \" i almost lost my nose . . . and \ni like it . \ni like breathing through it . \" \n-jack nicholson , chinatown \n", "armageddon , in itself , symbolizes everything that is wrong in modern filmmaking . \nstories have been replaced with special effects ; character development gets overshadowed by bad dialogue ; plotting consists of a bunch of shit getting blown up . \narmageddon is as stupid , as loud and as shallow as any movie you'll see come out this summer , or maybe even any other summer . \nbut i loved every freaking minute of it . \nbelieve me , i'm just as shocked as you are . \nhell , i don't even know why i went to see it in the first place . \nthe previews were so annoying that i predicted this was going to be the worst film of the year , or at least in the running . \ni'm sorry , but \" somebody dial 911 ! ! ! \" \nisn't quite the tagging that's going to sell a movie . \nit isn't too wise either to market the film using the movie's stupidest lines ( \" beam me up scotty \" - yeah , that sure is great writing . . . ) . \ni mean , let's face it ; armageddon's previews rival the truman show's as being some of the worst of the year . \nneither of them even come close to doing their respective films justice . \nof course , you all know the story . \nwhen the earth is threatened with total annihilation via an asteroid the size of texas , nasa calls in the us's top oil drillers ( ! ) to go into space ( ! ) and implant a nuclear device eight-hundred and someodd feet into the asteroid ( ! ) . \nin the coarse of all this mayhem , we are introduced to some interesting - and not so interesting - characters . \nbelonging to the former group is rockhound ( steve buscemi ) , a horny little womanizing genius who's always full of wisecracks , even when flying into space at a huge amount of g's . \nalso , there's the always cool-as-hell billy bob thornton as dan truman , the bigwig at nasa who recruits all the drillers . \nhe kind of reminded me of ed harris in apollo 13 , only without the intensity and great lines to deliver . \nthen on the flip side of the coin is the tired , contrived character of harry stamper ( bruce willis , who does the whole movie employing with annoying accent i can't quite place ) , the leader of the pack as well as liv tyler and ben affleck as the token lovers you must have in any summer movie . \nbasically , that's about it . \nas i said , this is hardly a film about plot . \nit's another summer blockbuster with plot points that are beyond unbelievable and dialogue and characters that are mostly completely wooden . \ncase in point : nasa doesn't know that there is even an asteroid on it's way until eighteen days before impact - huh ? \nanother example : at one point in the movie , two children are playing with toy space shuttles in front of a poster of kennedy . \nhow pretentious is that ? ? ? ! ! ! \nwant another one ? \nokay ; before the oil drillers blast off into space , one of them starts singing \" leaving on a jet plane \" , and soon , all the rest join in . \ndid michael bay attend the school of sappy filmmaking before he made this picture ? \nbut naturally , all this sappiness , melodrama and special effects accumulate to one bitchin' time at the movies . \nand don't get me wrong - despite all of the things i found wrong with armageddon , i still very much enjoyed it . \nso even if you don't win one of mcdonald's free tickets , it's still definitely worth checking out . \n", "this is one of the most funny and entertaining comedies of the year and it just happens to be animated . \nthere are some great voice over commentaries from hollywood's most famous celebrities , some fabulous animation and a compelling story . \nthis is the best we've seen from disney since \" beauty and the beast \" ( 1996 ) . \nthis film begins an unspecified time following the happily-ever-after conclusion to toy story . \nin the aftermath of their earlier adventures , buzz ( voice of tim allen ) and woody ( voice of tom hanks ) are now fast friends and all the toys live in perfect harmony , content with their \" lives \" . \none day , andy broke woody's arm off , while playing with him . \nwoody is now officially discarged and worthless , left with his nightmares , where he lies in a trash can with the other discards . \nlater andy's mother decides to have a yard sale , and she collects a few old toys from her son's room . \nsince one of these discards is a member of the moving toy gang , woody goes to the rescue , leaving the safety of the house for the uncertainty of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back . \nalthough his mission is successful , he is placed in a serious predicament when a toy collector named al ( voice of wayne knight ) spies woody while hunting through the wares available at the sale . \nthe cowboy toy represents the final collectible needed to complete his collection of merchandise from the old tv series , \" woody's roundup . \" \nif he can acquire woody , al can ship everything to a toy museum in japan for a huge profit . \nso , after andy's mother refuses to sell the wooden cowboy , al steals him , and it's up to the other toys , led by buzz , to go into the city to save their friend . \nand so , buzz , rex ( voice of wallace shawn ) , hamm ( voice of john ratzenberger ) , mr . potatohead ( voice of don rickles ) , and slinky ( voice of jim varney ) , go out on a dangerous journey to rescue their friend , they find themselves confronting things like busy streets and other buzz lightyear toys . \nthere are car chases , gun fights and finally the confrontation between buzz and his nemesis ( who , by the way , resembles darth vader ) . \nmeanwhile , woody learns that he was once a tv celebrity and has a family - a cowgirl named jessie ( voice of joan cusack ) , a horse named bullseye , and a father figure called the prospector ( voice of kelsey grammar ) . \nthey offer him another life , as a celebrity -- a toy in a museum in japan . \nhe is now forced to choose between being loved intensively by andy for a little while ( before he grows up ) and be forgotten , or be admired by children for generations . \nthe problem is , if woody escapes from al's clutches and returns home , they will end up back in the lonely darkness of storage . \na real effort is made in the technical department . \nthe animation is rich and colorful , with lots of wonderful details . the \" cinematography \" is also extremely improved since toy story ; there are a lot of complicated swings , turns and close-ups that really make an impression . \nlighting and filters are used to create a mood ( as in a surprisingly emotional moment - jessie's remembrance of her days when she was a beloved toy ) the film contains a lot of in-side jokes ( such as the one about videogames ) , and entertaining parodies on \" jurassic park \" and \" star wars \" . \nthe film ends with the \" failed takes \" , the kind of scenes that we are used to see after comedy shows on tv . \nthese outtakes are some of the funniest scenes in the film . \nbut what in the end makes \" toy story 2 \" a memorable experience is not the jokes , its multiple parodies or marvelous animation . \nit is its heart and emotions -- the story about the meaning of friendship , love and even life itself . \nit is not difficult to predict that \" toy story 2 \" would be a huge economical success , but its artistic achievement was unexpected . \nunexpected because the first film wasn't much more than a demonstration of special effects . \nbut mostly it was unexpected because disney hasn't produced anything spectacular in years and is constantly surpassed by companies such as dreamworks and warner brs . \nbut here the director has changed the atmosphere of the film , making it more accessible and interesting for persons older that 9 years . \nthis is a big step-away from the ancient laws of disney-animation . \noff course , this is not \" antz \" , it is not as intelligent ; this is not a landmark and no masterpiece , but i promise that you'll find it as funny and enjoyable as i have . \nwhether this is the best animated film of the year , i dare not say . \nmy choice would probably be \" the iron giant \" , but ( along side with \" american pie \" ) this is the comedy of the year . \ni almost lost my hopes for disney , but \" toy story 2 \" proves that disney hasn't lost their ability to entertain . \n", "not too many people know who james whale is , but it's a safe bet that a good chunk of them have seen his movies . \nif we are to believe the semi- biographical gods and monsters , whale would have wanted it to be that way . \nthis is an insightful , haunting exploration of the last days of the frankenstein and bride of frankenstein director , and it is notable for introducing one of the first complicated gay characters in a hollywood movie . \ngods and monsters has no interest in being a biopic of whale's life because it tracks only the final few days of his life , and it's probably a better movie for it . \nit's focus is on whale's ( ian mckellen ) untraditional and deceptive lust for heterosexual gardener clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) . \nit begins with whale ( a fairly talented artist , aside from being a director ) asking boone to \" sit for him , \" ( pose for a portrait ) . \nat first , boone doesn't realize that whale is gay and grows fascinated with the old man . \nwhen he does discover whale's sexual orientation from his dedicated and protective maid ( lynn redgrave ) , he is frightened , refusing to sit for the guy . \nbut he comes back , only to storm out again , disgusted with whale's \" locker room talk . \" \nboone returns yet another time , after whale promises to tone down the aforementioned \" locker room talk , \" and finds their platonic relationship to be strengthening . \nmeanwhile , jimmy himself is suffering from hallucinations and mental attacks as a result of his stroke not long ago . \nhis ailment leads to desperation and depression , which build to the point where he is forced to ask boone for an incredulously big favor . \nwhat is perhaps most sensational about gods and monsters is brendan fraser's bravura performance ; up until seeing this film i intensely disliked the young actor because of his tendency to ruin the movies he is in ( blast from the past , for example ) . \ni was surprised how expressive an actor he proved himself to be here . \nthis is impressive because his character's dialogue is minimal , with mckellan doing most of the talking . \nthat requires fraser to act through body language ; a difficult skill to master , but something he proves capable of doing well . \nthis is not to ignore mckellan's oscar nominated turn . \nhe earned that nomination with his touching performance here ( although , at the risk of sounding like a philistine , i would have chosen his performance as the nazi in apt pupil for the nomination ) ; an understated , compelling gem . \nwhale dreaded being remembered solely for his work in the hollywood horror genre , and he thought hollywood to be the equivalent of a battlefield . \nhe rejoiced in being free from it , only reluctantly going to receptions with fellow movie people . \nin the end , perhaps , it is what killed him : the memories of hollywood and war blending together to form a living nightmare . \n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \n", "when i initially set out to review this film , my tag line was going to be \" you too can believe whales can fly \" . \nthen it was going to be \" you too can believe pastel triangles can fly \" . \nthen , it was going to be \" you too can believe wood sprites can fly \" . \nfinally , i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say . . . \nthere's a lot of flying going on in this film ! \nas our first host steve martin tells us , the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in . \nwell apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while , because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released . \npart of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940 ( grossing somewhere close to $110 , 000 in its original month of release ) . \nsubsequent re-releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved ( and rightfully deserved ) . \nto celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia , disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before : six stories high . \nin an exclusive four month engagement ( from january 1st to april 30th , 2000 ) , fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us . \nafter the engagement is over , the film will be shown at regular theaters . \nis the format effective for the film ? \nwith a few exceptions , yes . \nthe first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven's fifth symphony . \nit's hard to describe exactly what this segment is about , but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily . \neverything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil , black bat-like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts . \neventually , shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat-like things and peace returns to the butterfly things . \nthough this segment isn't very story driven , some of the images are very visually strong , especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things ( who are all outlined in blood red colors ) begin to overtake the skies . \nthe next segment is set to ottorino respighi's \" the pines of rome \" . \nin this segment , some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape . \na whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack . \nhe is finally saved ( by another liberating shaft of light ) and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the \" oceans \" of clouds . \nagain , visuals are the key with this segment , especially where the whales are involved . \nreportedly the whales , as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences , are shown as actual size . \nthe cgi whales look incredibly life-like , except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images . \none especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent . \nabsolutely beautiful stuff . \nthe third segment ( and the least of the eight segments ) is set to george gershwin's \" rhapsody in blue \" . \nthis segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld , and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york . \nthere's a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer , an out-of-work sad sack that dreams of having a job , a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm , and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife . \ni won't go into how everything works out , but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending . \nunfortunately , the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments . \nsegment four is set to dmitri shostakovich's \" piano concerto no . 2 \" and is an animated version of hans christian andersen's \" the steadfast tin soldier \" . \na one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a wind-up clock ballerina ( whom he assumes is also one legged because he can't see her other leg extended out behind her ) , much to the dismay of an evil jack-in-the-box jester . \nthe jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina . \nlittle does the jester know , the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from . \nthe soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl . \nalthough the ending has been altered from the andersen story , \" the steadfast tin soldier \" is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short . \nsome children may find the jester to be a little frightening , but otherwise the segment is well made . \nsegment five is the funniest of the bunch . \nset to camille saint-saens \" the carnival of the animals \" , this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yo-yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number . \nwhile it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia , it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy . \nsegment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original 1940 fantasia , and it's the one that people remember most , \" the sorcerer's apprentice \" . \nthe story is the most recognizable , so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo . \nunfortunately , the segment wasn't made to be presented on large format film ( considering it was shot full frame ) and exhibits large amounts of grain . \nthere were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain . \nsimilar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately ( but no one seems to notice for some strange reason ) , an anomaly common to many 18-plus screen theaters . \nsegment seven is set to sir edward elgar's \" pomp and circumstance march no . 1 \" and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character . \ndonald duck \" stars \" as an assistant to noah , whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark . \nduring the loading , donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didn't make it on the boat . \nthey are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners . \ndespite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece , it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tear-jerkers foisted on audiences these days . \npowerful stuff . \nsegment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich ? \" saving the best for last \" . \nset to igor stravinsky's \" the firebird \" , an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into a beautiful springtime landscape . \ntrees bloom and flowers blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a strange formation . \nwhen the sprite examines the formation , it awakens and becomes the titular firebird . \nin a stunning spectacle , the firebird rears back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in its path , including everything that the sprite has worked to create . \nsome amazing animation is present here , and well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone ( although brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film ) . \nthe host segments are largely ( no pun intended ) throwaways , although steve martin's clip is pretty funny . \nbe sure to stay through the credits for a little more humor from martin . \npenn and teller are usually funny , but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting . \nthe best segment comes from , of all people , bette midler , who gets to tell us about some of the abandoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board . \npieces like flight of the bumblebee , a take on the four horsemen set to wagner's \" ride of the valkyries \" , and a strange segment prepared in the '40s by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installments . \nfor fans of visual stimulation or classical music , fantasia 2000 is a perfect way to spend the afternoon . \nthe film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material . \nas i mentioned earlier in the review , if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film , fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters . \ni must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though . \nthen you too can believe that whales/triangle things/sprites can fly . \n[g] \n", "it's tough to really say something nice about a type of person who's so ethnocentric that any humanity they once had is now gone , but by god , \" american history x \" does it , and for that , i commend it . \nit not only takes balls but intelligence to make a human being out of a neo-nazi skinhead , a kind of person who dedicates their lives to hating anyone who's not what they are , and this film wisely and miracurously pulls it off . \nthe subject of this film is one of them , but he is worse than one of the blind followers that make up most skinhead members since he is the leader of the pack . \nhe's the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage , and then in another brilliant stroke , justifies it with political propoganda that makes eerie sense when he speaks . \nhe's so utterly convincing as a public speaker and so firm in his convictions that it comes as a shock when he actually goes through the rehabilitation process . \nhis name is derek vinyard , and he's played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks he's almost as convincing and arresting a public speaker as , say , malcom x . when we first see him , he's clean shaven , with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast , a devlish goatee , and he's attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxers and carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullets , at least when he doesn't need them . \nhe so believes in his convictions that he's willing to put his beliefs to the test , even if he knows it will mean a stop in prison , if only for a couple years . \n \" american history x \" is about derek , how he became a neo-nazi skinhead , how he rose to power , how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that was less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself , and how he tried to save others , namely his younger brother , from making the same mistake . \nwe see him at all of these stages - as a smart teenager , a vicious hate monger , a man having an epiphany , and the man who tries to correct what he's done before - and in all of these , we get a portrait of a man from all sides . \nor at least , that's the intention . \nthe film's framing device is his brother , danny ( edward furlong , perpetually looking about 13 ) , also now a skinhead , and how his principal , bob sweeney ( avery brooks , who i just found out was or is the captain on star trek's deep space 9 ) , is trying to \" correct \" him . \nwhen the film opens , danny has just written a book report on \" mein kampf , \" landing him in trouble with sweeney , which causes him to make him write a paper on derek's life and how it has gotten him nowhere . \ncoincidentally , this day is the day derek is released from prison , and when we see him , he's cleaned-up , not as buff , and has a full head of hair . \nhe's just as intelligent , but still very rough along the edges , but he's wisened up . \nhe's no longer controlled by his anger at blacks and jews , and tries to persuade danny , who's becoming what derek was before , to give up his lifestyle . \nbut danny won't . \nhe goes to a large skinhead beer bash , meets with the skinhead leader ( stacy keach ) , and then discovers that derek is as opposed to neo-nazi-dom as he was for it a couple of years ago . \nthe film circles around this , then spins off into non-linear flashbacks , all done in black and white . \nwe mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead , living in venice beach , organizing vicious and quasi-sadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the white , middle-class teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants to do the same work , and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action and how illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built on . \nto them , the white man is the one who has gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop , and he not only speaks elloquently , forcefully , and intelligently , but he backs everything up with political reasons , justifying their rage at least to them . \nand frighteningly enough , much of what he says sounds true . \n \" american history x \" is a collection of really great scenes and moments , rather than a cohesive , great film that flows effortlessly from one moment to the next . \nin it , there are some of the best scenes i've seen all year . \none scene features a dinner between derek's family , and his mother's newest boyfriend ( played with reserve by eliott gould ) , a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek's rightist views , launching the scene into a fit of rage and anger that builds unparalled emotions in the audience ( gould's reaction to derek's final summation is unnerrving ) . \nanother scene uses humor and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connection between derek and a black co-worker ( guy torry ) while folding laundry in prison . \nand another soon-to-be-classic is actually divided in two : the murder of the two black men that winds derek in jail , which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year . \nthere's much more to appreciate , like the acting , which is uniformly good , with stand-outs coming from avery brooks , beverly d'angelo ( as the long-suffering mother ) , and gould ( who has one horrible line , but other than that , comes off with the best performance he's given in what seems like a really long time ) . \nnorton walks off with the film , though , coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job to rubble . \nin only the fifth movie of his career , norton has invented himself as one of the most reliable and intense actors of his generation , and maybe the best . \nthere's nothing like it when norton really gets rolling in this movie , spewing out lines with such authority that he commands all attention from the audience , coming off with power similar to that of a young maron brando . \nthat he allows the little emotions to seep through is amazing . \nsadly enough , this isn't going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hopes to be . \nit's too unambitious and even a little contrived to really take off as either a powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece . \nthe ending , especially , is pencilled in from other movies , tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon . \nsome of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches ( kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the \" fat skinhead , \" whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more ) , and even the dramatic arc isn't as well travelled . \nfurlong's danny never seems to really be learning a lesson , since the flashbacks refuse to show his point of view , and when he decides to make a change by the end ( which was inevitable ) , it doesn't seem like it has actually arrived there . \neven derek's descent into skinhead-dom doesn't seem justified . \nthough his fireman father ( william russ , the dad from \" boy meets world , \" and don't ask me how i know that ) is killed by a black junkie , and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently , there never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his beliefs . \nas such , one can see why the director , tony kaye , wanted to have his name removed . \nsorta . \n \" american history x \" is a very good movie , and i was very moved by it , but it could be a lot better , and the problem seems to be that the cut as it is is not up to what he claims to be his potential . \nsomewhere , he claims , there lies a tony kaye cut , and that was to be the true cut until it was viewed by norton , who then ordered another cut , and that is thus . \nalthough he aimed for the directing credit to go to \" alan smithee , \" the resident name for any film that is to be disowned by its director , it wasn't allowed to him , under the grounds that once you disown a film , you can not badmouth it ( but really , that's the macguffin - no one really wanted a film this good to be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval ) . \nkaye's right in that it's not up to par , even if he's not referring to normal par but rather his own personal par . \nthis will not be a \" do the right thing \" for the late 90s . \nyet it still gets its point across intelligently , and backs it up with its story ( its message , that one cannot be so enwrapped in one's own beliefs or pain and suffering will occur , is literally said over the narration , unfortunately ) . \nand even if it isn't perfect , at least when avery brooks turns to norton after he has been beaten and raped in prison , and asks him if anything he's done has made his life any better , it realy hits a nerve , not only in derek , but also in the audience . \n", "synopsis : as a response to accusations of sexual prejudice in the armed forces , a female naval intelligence officer is chosen to be a test case . \nif she can survive the demanding s . e . a . l . \ntraining , she will open the way for other women to be permitted to follow in her footsteps . \nthrow in a lot of political machinations , sabotage , brutality , water and sand and you have an entertaining movie . \nreview : the title of this movie turned me off at first . \ni mean 'gi jane ? ' ? ? ? ? ? \nthe other titles which were considered were more promising - in pursuit of honor or a matter of honor would have been acceptable although navy cross or undisclosed are a little meaningless as far as i'm concerned . \ni went into this movie not liking the title and being one of those people who thinks that demi moore is absolutely ghastly as an actor . \nto my surprise i really enjoyed the movie . \nmoore as lieutenant jordan o'neil is much more likeable than her washed out excuse for a gusty woman in a few good men . \nthe storyline is simple . \nanne bancroft playing senator lillian dehaven is a ruthless , machiavellian politician with an agenda to push . \nusing feminism to achieve political mileage , she forces the military powers that be to backdown and permit a test case to enter the highly intensive navy s . e . a . l . \ntraining . \njordan is selected due to the fact that she has it all - looks , brains and strength . \nthe training is gruelling and the indignity almost painful to watch . \nnonetheless , it's one of those movies that makes me want to cheer out and encourage the hapless hero/heroine along in his/her endeavours . \nsure , there are the stereotypical elements - inhuman treatment , sexual innuendo , resentful peers , pained boyfriend and sexist commanding officer . \nstepping away from the stereotypes though , viggo mortensen as master chief john urgayle tries to get away from being nothing more than a brutal screamer . \nhis character exercises a little more intellectual rigour than you would normally expect from such a character . \njordan's boyfriend royce is also in the military . \nalthough they both started at the same time , due to the fact that he has seen active service , he has advanced through the ranks much more quickly than she has . \nroyce ( what is his surname ? \ndo we care ? ) \nalmost resents jordan's attempts to advance herself , although he quickly settles down to being doe-eyed and supportive . \nhis character seems to have been thrown in so that we know that you don't have to be a lesbian to want to be in the military . \nin parts , this is a very silly movie , with gratuitous lines and scenes thrown in for effect which are so blatantly obvious or contrived that it's hard not to cringe . \ni still liked it though . \nweaknesses in the script aside , this is a film which captures a heroic and reckless mood . \nas we watch jordan's battle , it's increasingly clear that it is a personal battle . \nthis is an individual's fight for self-advancement . \nwe don't have to have our teeth set on edge by didactic preachings , we don't have to feel uncomfortable because we're having ideology thrust down our throats . \nit's enough that we can sit back and hope that this one person gets what she wants and we can admire her tenacity and determination without coming out and saying whether we believe women should go into combat or not . \n", "the idea at the center of the devil's advocate , which is , thus far , one of the three or four best films of 1997 , is that no matter what decision is made , evil will triumph -- god is a trickster , satan is a humanist -- \" the last humanist \" . \nhe appears in many guises , and seduces many men and women -- in his own words , \" vanity -- by far my favorite sin \" . \nal pacino plays this role with relish , and gets to chew some delectable lines ( \" lemme givya a piece o' inside wisdom on god . . . \" , \" i have a million names . . . \" ) , as john milton -- the devil . \nthe main idea -- that he can appear as anyone , in any form ( in this case , a buisness man ) , harkens mainly back to terry gilliam's the time bandits . \nbut the film , is something else , something original . \npart of what makes it so very good , is that it never takes itself too seriously -- it dabbles with morality , vanity , death , and child abuse , but doesn't try to become any profound study of power . \nthis is a marvelous confection -- cocky , funny , thought provoking . \nit is also entertaining . \nthere is no way you could possibly predict the ending -- it pulls back upon itself , drawing purely out of the mind's eye . \nthe final shot is more creative , more daring , more challenging , then anything in cinema since the white sock in the coen's fargo . \nthe central themes are fascinating ( sometimes reminiscent of james' the turn of the screw , and oates' accursed inhabitants of the house of bly ) , and the product that is built around it really wows . \nits nice to know that things like this are still being made . \n", "scream 2 , like its predecessor , is a genre-crossing film . \nit is about 50% horror film and 50% murder mystery . \nthe mix worked very well last time and it continues to entertain this time . \nscream was also known for its self-referential tone . \nmany inside jokes were made in reference to horror movies and wes craven . \nagain , scream 2 follows suit with characters saying such things as \" sequels suck \" and \" the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels . \" \nscream 2's story is very similar to it's predecessor's . \nsidney ( neve campbell ) , having survived the killing spree in scream , is now in college . \ngale weathers ( courteney cox ) has written a book about the murders and that book is now being released as a feature film , called stab ( which for all practical purposes is the real-world movie scream ) . \nat the premiere of stab , two students from sidney's college are stabbed to death , and a new story begins . \nthe press descends on sidney and her college to get the scoop on this sequel killer . \nthey want to know all about the links between stab , sidney , and the recent murders . \nthe most complex self-reference i saw ( this should be an olympic event ) was the scene where gale weathers was asking questions at a press conference . \nthe rest of the press was watching and videotaping weathers . \nthe other survivors from scream were watching and videotaping the press . \nthe audience was watching the whole , filmed scene . \n ( whew . ) \nthe movie is packed with layers and self-references that make it a pleasure to watch . \neven better would be to watch a double feature of scream and scream 2 . that's not to say that these references necessarily make scream 2 a deep , or even a good movie . \nthe just add to the fun of watching it . \ni recommend it for other reasons as well . \nwhat i liked best about the horror aspect of the movie is that the monster is not supernatural . \nno werewolf or ghost or psycho with superhuman strength is responsible . \nit is a person in a mask and a robe , his only advantage the fear he strikes into his victims . \nno extraordinary leap of faith is needed to believe in the killer . \nthe down side is that if you are frightened by horror movies , you have less grounds to say \" it's just a movie . \" \nthe whodunit aspect of the movie is not that great by itself - gale weathers and deputy dewey ( david arquette , also from the original ) track down a killer . \nthey are likeable , but not outstanding . \nbut in combination with the horror aspect , the whodunit is a perfect counterpoint . \nit was exactly a year ago today that i wrote the review for scream . \nthe internet movie database says that scream 3 is in the works , so i wonder if i'll be doing the same thing on january 1 , 1999 . \nif craven and screenwriter kevin williamson are able to keep the quality high , i'll be happy to mark my calendar . \n", "when i first saw the previews for ron howard's latest film , my expectations were discouragingly low . \na show about nothing ? \nsounds like \" seinfeld . \" \na guy whose entire life is broadcast 24 hours a day ? \nsounds like \" the truman show . \" \nwhat is it with hollywood that no sooner than one production company puts out an animated feature about ants , another puts one out about bugs ? \nwhich is why i was pleasantly surprised by \" edtv , \" which turns out to be a fresh , insightful , and often times hilarious film about the follies of instant celebrity . \nthe writing , by howard's longtime collaborators lowell ganz and babaloo mandel , is right on the money and howard himself should be credited for giving the subject matter a fresh focus . \nin the hands of a less-experienced director , \" edtv \" could easily have had all the flavor of yesterday's meatloaf . \nwith their 'true tv' cable ratings being threatened by 'the gardening channel' ( apparently people would rather watch soil ) , the northwest broadcasting company is looking for a novel concept to attract viewers . \nprogram director cynthia topping ( ellen degeneres ) comes up with the idea of putting a nobody on the air and broadcasting his every waking and sleeping moment . \nthe hook is to find a regular guy , someone normal that people can relate to . \nwhile scouting possible candidates , cynthia's camera crew discover ed pekurny and his pig brother ray ( woody harrelson ) in a bar , where ray believes he has what it takes for his fifteen plus minutes of fame . \nbut on watching the videotape , the show's producers are more taken with ed than with ray . \nhe's cute , he says all the wrong things , and he's 100% usda hick . \ncynthia's boss , played by rob reiner , gives the show a week to deliver the goods and it's tough going in the early stages . \nthe most exciting thing that happens is ed brushes his teeth . \n \" action shot ! \" \nwags one of the production assistants when a couple of pop tarts jump out of the toaster . \nyou get the idea . \nbut soon enough , things--nielsen-boosting kinds of things--start to happen to this unassuming san francisco video store clerk and the 'true tv' cameras are right there to document it . \ned's privacy is no longer his own , his newfound fame starts having a negative impact on his family life , and what little dignity he has left is trampled on by the media . \nwho should ed go out with ? \nyou can be sure the pollsters have a list . \nnot only is the film exceedingly well cast , but its performers are consistently excellent . \nmatthew mcconaughey provides the face , the body language , and the lovable texan accent to fill the shoes of america's latest phenomenon . \nhe and harrelson look like they really could be brothers . \nsally kirkland is noteworthy in a difficult role as ed's mother , and martin landau is one of the film's highlights as al , ed's ailing stepfather . \njenna elfman ( from tv's \" dharma and greg \" ) proves herself surprisingly worthy in the company of kirkland and landau , although those alpine eyebrows of hers get a little distracting . \neven degeneres and reiner are better than you'd expect . \nin 1979 , writer/director/comedian albert brooks made a zany little film called \" real life \" in which a small-time opportunist makes a real-time documentary about a typical american family . \nthe scenes of ed's family sitting around the dinner table feasting on kentucky fried chicken and waxing idiotic play like a big-budget variant on that film , paralleling its wickedly inventive humor . \nas with most films by albert brooks , \" real life \" was funny , but absurd . \nthe funniest--and scariest--thing about \" edtv \" is that it is absolutely believable . \n", "ingredients : james bond , scuba scene , car controlled by cellular telephone \nsynopsis : warped media tycoon elliot carver ( jonathan pryce ) plots to start a war between britain and china in order to boost ratings by

\nthis time bond teams up with top female agent wai lin from china ( michelle yeoh ) . \nthe film contains fights , chases , gadgets , and comedic moments . \nopinion : it does not have a casino scene or a ski scene , but tomorrow never dies is nevertheless a solid , enjoyable bond movie . \nit neither stands out nor disappoints . \nin old bond movies bond sometimes teamed up with american cia

asia's top female star . \nlike jackie chan , she does her own stunts . \nshe was born in malaysia - - a country of many languages - - and her primary language ( the language she speaks in her sleep ) is english . \nshe was taught malay in school , and learned cantonese from bilingual parents . \nas an athlete michelle represented malaysia internationally . \nshe enjoyed squash , diving , swimming , and rugby . \nshe studied ballet at the royal academy of dance in london , but switched to drama after a spinal injury . \nin 1983 she won the miss malaysia pageant - - without really intending to , since a family member had entered her in the contest without her knowledge . \nnotoriety from the contest led eventually to a movie career as an action heroine . \nmichelle has survived a divorce with asian retail tycoon dickson poon ; a nearly fatal stunt accident falling from a freeway overpass which put her in the hospital for three months , and ; a retirement from the movies . \nher comeback from retirement , supercop ( 1992 ) became the top grossing film in asia that year . \nit is not clear what michelle\u0012s martial arts style is , but it may be a theatrical version of wing chun . \nof her character wai lin in tomorrow never dies , michelle says , \" wai lin is the first bond girl who is on a par with bond , someone who can match up with him mentally and physically . \" \nmy own opinion is that casting michelle yeoh as agent wai lin was an excellent choice . \n", "it is always refreshing to see a superstar actor who gets paid more than enough to forget about working for a living to want to take a chance and play a less-than-savoury character as mel gibson does in payback . \nof course , if i was being paid $25 million for one month's work , i'd probably be willing to take risks as well , but that's neither here nor there . \npayback is based on a novel by richard stark ( apparently actually donald e . westlake , author of the grifters , itself a fine crime film ) which was also filmed in the 1960s as point blank starring one of the toughest of tough guys , lee marvin . \nthe film opens with gibson having recovered from being shot several times in the back , by whom we don't know yet . \nall we know is that gibson , as porter , isn't a happy chappy and is hellbent on getting the money stolen from him back , and getting even in the process , no matter what the consequences . \nit turns out that the man he's after is val ( gregg henry ) , his sometime partner with whom he stole a briefcase full of cash from a gang of chinese mobsters . \nobviously not having much of a crisis of the soul , val figures porter is dead and goes about using his share of the money to pay off a debt to his employers . \nporter , however , is the sort of man who holds a grudge and once on his feet , goes about exacting revenge on the double-crossing val . \ngibson gives a terrific performance in the sort of role which he was born to play , that of a slightly unhinged guy who doesn't mind beating up or shooting people to get what he wants . \nyou probably wouldn't see other actors in his salary range take such an offbeat , out-of-character role such as porter ( jim carrey won't be doing anything like this in a hurry after what happened the last time he tried - the cable guy , anyone ? ) . \nharrison ford's idea of playing an unsympathetic character is presumed innocent ; the last time schwarzenegger played a villain was batman and robin , which we won't mention further ; and has stallone ever really played a villain at all ? \nthis is not to say that porter is a villain , per se . \nwhile he isn't the sort of character you wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of , he's nothing compared to some of the ones we are forced to watch in countless bad thrillers and action films where they kill innocent people in the blink of an eye or execute their right-hand men just to prove how mean they are . \nporter is only trying to get back what is not-so-rightfully his , which in a way is almost understandable . \npayback is an enjoyable dramatic black comedy-thriller which won't be remembered as being among gibson's most important work , but is still one of the finer films he's done . \nthe only real problem with it is that , while everything seems to work out in the end , i was left feeling something was lacking ; was that all ? \nthe ending looks as if it was tacked on at the last minute , and the final voice-over doesn't ring true , even though it was used to good effect elsewhere in the film-noir style the rest of the film embodies . \nthe film just ends far too suddenly , after a huge build-up in the penultimate scenes . \na fine film , even though it needs just a little something more to be the kind of a film that can be recommended without hesitation . \njust be ready for a possible letdown of an ending . \n", "if you thought baz luhrmann's radical take on _william_shakespeare's_romeo_+_juliet_ was wild , wait until what you see what tony award-winning stage director julie taymor ( _the_lion_king : _the_broadway_musical_ ) does to the bard's _titus_andronicus_ for her audacious--and very bloody--film debut . \nwhile luhrmann transplanted the star-crossed lovers to 1990s florida , taymor keeps this grisly tale of revenge in rome--but places it in a surreal temporal limbo . \nthe colosseum suggests the proper time of imperial rome , but high rises and heavy duty kitchen ovens suggest the 1990s , while the vintage automobiles and some costumes are more '40s and '50s , and other garments are more gladiator-like . \nas tamora , queen of goths ( jessica lange ) exacts revenge on roman general titus ( anthony hopkins ) for killing her eldest son , and he does the same to her for the wrongs she commits , taymor obviously wanted to express the timeless relevance of the story's underlying themes . \nhowever , the time convergence approach only works at times , for often it's just distracting , as in one scene where tamora's suviving sons ( matthew rhys and jonathan rhys meyers ) blow off steam playing video arcade games . \ntaymor didn't have to resort to such avant garde time tricks , for the story would have resonated just as strongly had she jettisoned them . \nshe is a strong storyteller and a master visual stylist , the latter compliment encompassing all areas , makeup and costume choices as well as those in the editing and photography departments . \nshe also has a sure way with actors ; hopkins' titus is at once tragic and horrifying , and lange is sultry as the viperous tamora . \nthe clear standout of the cast , however , is harry lennix as aaron , a moor who is tamora's secret lover and a schemer in his own right . \nlennix brings great depth to a role that could have easily been played as a stock villain . \na great villain he indeed is , but to leave it at that isn't giving full justice to his powerful and multi-dimensional work . \n_titus_ isn't a complete success , but it is never less than fascinating , and it announces the arrival of a fearlessly imaginative new cinematic voice . \n", "meteor threat set to blow away all volcanoes & twisters !

striking scene early in \" city of angels , \" where all the angels who live unseen in our midst , gather at the beach to watch the sun rise . \nthe camera moves above them , showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women , all garbed in black . \nthen the camera moves in on the face of seth , an angel played by nicolas cage , and as the sun rises , he smiles and his entire face lights up . \nyou see , the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets , but they cannot feel a human touch . \nit is an important scene for several reasons . \nfirst of all , it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible . \nthe film presents these fantastic beings as normal-looking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth , watching what goes on with little interference . \nthere are none of the standard , hokey angel references used in recent films like \" angels in the outfield \" ( 1994 ) or \" michael \" ( 1996 ) . \nthe angels here are stark and believable . \nthis early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition , for its shows how god's angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot , and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures , like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs , or the smell of the salt in the air . \nthere is an inherent tragedy in being an angel , although there is much beauty in it as well . \nthey eternally walk the earth , listening to our thoughts , touching us in our pain , and leading the dying to heaven . \nlike human existence , being an angel is often confused and unsure . \n \" city of angels \" is essentially a love story , between seth and a human , a beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan ) . \nhe first sees her when he is in her operating room , waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven . \nmaggie is distraught , doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table , and seth is moved by her efforts and , more importantly , her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies . \nangels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain , and seth does what he can with his invisible touch , but it's not enough . \nhe wants to be with her and share her pain , not just stand back at a distance . \nhe learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to \" fall \" and become human . \nhe learns this from another fallen angel , played by dennis franz ( \" n . y . p . d . \nblue \" ) in a touching and humorous performance . \nsitting at a diner together , franz tells cage's character about how wonderful it is to be human - to be able to taste food , feel another person's skin , smell the air , and most importantly , have a loving wife and children . \nof course , there is pain to go along with all this , but for seth , it will be worth it . \n \" city of angels \" is something of a reinterpretation of wim wender's haunting 1988 film \" wings of desire . \" \nwenders' film was more like a poem - it was the feeling , the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened . \nthe americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles , and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human . \nand , unlike most foreign films that are re-made into hollywood fare , it doesn't suffer extensive damage . \nthis may be because director brad silberling ( \" casper \" ) and screenwriter dana stevens ( \" blink \" ) wanted to make \" city of angels \" its own movie - inspired by \" wings of desire , \" but not an attempt to copy it . \nand yet , \" city of angels \" is not a typical hollywood movie . \nit is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale ( \" the english patient \" ) , whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world . \nseale creates many striking visuals : in addition to the beach scene , there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around , looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by . \nwhile the film travels along a charted plot , it takes time to develop its characters and situations ; it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly , and shows just how thin those boundaries are . \nboth cage and ryan give soulful , soft-spoken performances . \nryan , who is usually so bouncy and energetic , truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch . \ncage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple , heartfelt gazes , and speaks with the comforting , knowing voice that only an angel could have . \nwhat is most striking about \" city of angels \" is that stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay , which is both unexpected and challenging . \nit's not a formulaic hollywood ending , because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time . \nit doesn't give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance . \ninstead , it offers something much better , something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive . \n____________________________________________ visit \" charlie don't surf ! \" \nan eclectic collection of film reviews by james kendrick

enthusiasm , and affection like george lucas' 1977 classic , star wars . \nthe original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers , but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture . \narguably , more americans today can explain what \" the force \" or a \" jedi \" is than a budget deficit or a serb . \nso 22 years after the release of the original , and 16 years since the third film , the return of the jedi , how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation ? \ncan a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy - luke , han solo , and darth vader -all cultural icons ? \nagainst this challenge , the fourth star wars film , episode one : the phantom menace hit the screens last week . \nand despite some early critical reviews in the major media , the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment . \nwhile the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series , it is nonetheless engaging , exciting , and visually breathtaking . \nit is a worthy sequel - er , prequel - to the original star wars films . \nthe phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films . \nas the film opens , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars , is only a young jedi apprentice , still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) . \nthe republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation . \nthe jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations , but in the middle of a planetary invasion , rushing to protect naboo's young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) . \nlater , after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo , they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle-damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice . \non tatooine , qui-gon discovers a young slave boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) , who not only can help them get the parts they need , but displays uncanny intelligence , insight , and instincts . \nqui-gon senses the child is \" unusually strong \" with the force and begins to suspect that he may be \" the one \" prophesized to \" bring balance to the force . \" \nas anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows , far from being a galactic savior , the innocent-looking 9-year-old will in time become the ruthless darth vader . \ncomplicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure , darth sidious , is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo , and sends out a lethal apprentice , darth maul , to find and capture queen amidala . \nwhile amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet , they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul . \nif the plot sounds a bit complicated , it is . \nthe phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis , but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic , the demise of the jedi knights , anakin's turn to evil , and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy . \nbut the complexity is not overwhelming . \nthe story moves quickly , with the only drawback being that many questions , predictably , remain unanswered at the end of the film , setting the stage for the next episode . \none of the reasons the film's story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing , but too unfocused . \nit's unclear whose story phantom menace is . \nin the original trilogy , the movies were clearly luke's story , with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight . \nbut it's unclear whether this new film is anakin's story or obi-wan's . \nif this trilogy is centered on anakin , it's a shaky foundation . \nlloyd , like many child actors , lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers , and as a result , his character seems shallow and unimpressive . \non screen , we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little-boy face , or for that matter , any presence that would make him seem so special that qui-gon is willing to believe he is \" the one . \" \nthe rest of the cast does fine , though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas . \nneeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight . \nmcgregor is well-cast as obi-wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility . \nportman fits the role of a young queen well , but her lines were often very formal , giving her little room to give her character much personality . \nthe biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters , but the interaction between them . \nindividually , the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars , and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series . \nbut unlike the previous trilogy , lucas doesn't do as good of a job playing the characters off one another . \nin star wars , there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han , han and obi-wan , and leia and luke . \nthe ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities . \nin the sequence in where luke , han , and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star , the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other . \nthere is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other . \nindividually , they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests , but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them . \nthis is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film , and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers . \nbut despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction , the film is still very engaging . \nmany of the wonderful elements of lucas' previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining . \nfirst , of course , is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates . \nthe characters visit magical underwater cities , evade dinosaur-sized sea monsters , fight battle droids and menacing \" destroyers \" on venetian-looking planet of naboo , watch a spectacular event , part roman-chariot race , part nascar circuit , on the arid desert planet of tatooine , then head to corsucant , the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council . \neach location is elaborate and complex . \nlucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings , he creates rich , spectacular landscapes , palaces , and skylines . \nmost of the new special effects in his re-released special edition trilogy in 1997 were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just weren't possible when the films were made . \nmore than ever , in this new film , lucas' universe is filled with a menagerie of creatures , robots with personalities , and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters . \nthe best such character is watto , a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves . \nwatto has a scratchy italian voice and a short , paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like a hummingbird as he floats around the room . \nof all the computer-generated characters in the film , watto is the best done and most enjoyable . \nspeaking of computer-generated characters , no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film : jar jar binks . \nwith more than 80 minutes of screen time , jar jar is the realization of george lucas' dream to include a fully computer-generated character into the cast of the new trilogy . \njar jar , a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race , literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the film and becomes qui jon's accidental sidekick . \njar jar usually performs a comic-relief role in the film , lightening scenes with his mishaps and inability to stay out of trouble . \nthe animation of jar jar is nearly seamless , and he interacts with the characters throughout the film as if he were really on the set with the actors . \nhowever , despite the technological magic that makes his character possible , jar jar isn't completely convincing . \nhe still moves and sounds too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene . \nthroughout the movie , jar jar never transcends a \" roger rabbit \" -like presence . \nyou accept that he's there , but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character . \ninitially , i found jar jar annoying , but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film . \non my second viewing of the film , jar jar was a lot of fun and i didn't mind him at all . \na second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates . \ndespite all the film's struggles between good and evil , and the sober musings about one's destiny and \" the force , \" like all star wars films , the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously . \nfortunately , lucas hasn't lost sight of the fact that his films are entertainment , not high art . \nfrom the bumbling jar jar , to a one-man , two-headed announcer team calling the action at the film's thrilling pod-race sequence , to a cameo appearance by e . t . \nin the film , the phantom menace is simply a lot of fun , with lots of half-hidden jokes and humor that can easily be missed . \nand finally , the phantom menace works because , as in all his films , there is no shortage of speed and action . \nfrom beginning to end , there are light-saber battles , hair-raising chases , and thrilling duels between good and evil . \nthe pod-race sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars film , and the final showdown between obi-wan , qui-gon , and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed , most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed . \nthe phantom menace won't win any major oscars . \nit probably won't beat titanic's box office record . \nand it's not even the best star wars film ( i'd put it third , after the original and the empire strikes back ) . \nbut it's an exciting and entertaining film , far better than your typical summer blockbuster . \nthe film can't live up to it's hype - no film , not even the original star wars , could have done that . \nbut it's still worth seeing . . . \nprobably more than once . \n", "the premise is simple , if not bizarre . \na mad scientist ( trace beaulieu as dr . clayton forrester ) launches an average-joe ( michael j . nelson as mike nelson ) into space where he forces his subject to watch the most horrendous movies ever made . \nwhy ? \nit's torturous , it's maniacal , and it's just plain fun . \nbased on the cult-favorite cable television series , mystery science theater 3000 : the movie isn't torturous , but as for being maniacal and just plain fun , it foots the bill quite nicely . \nmike nelson , on a dog-bone shaped spacecraft , spends his days as any young man would dream - indulging in sarcasm and horseplay , and seeing quite a few movies . \nthe catch is , these movies aren't the movies he chooses , but retched examples of film-making chosen specifically by dr . forrester in an attempt to break mike's will to live . \ndr . forrester is convinced that one too many b- movies is all it will take to ruin a man , but with a couple of wise-cracking puppet buddies ( tom servo , voiced by kevin murphy , and crow t . robot , voiced by beaulieu ) , the torture becomes somewhat of a honorary party for all that is wrong in the world of cheezy cinema . \nthe purpose behind mst3k is to exploit some of the worst films known ( even if by very few of us ) to man . \nwe watch as the silhouettes of mike , tom , and crow sit in a darkened theater poking fun at the movie going on before them . \nin this case , it's the 1954 sci-fi film this island earth . \nwe basically watch as our three leads watch , only we get the pleasure of eavesdropping on their hilarious commentary . \nthe plots behind the movies ripped apart are really quite irrelevant , but for the sake of those who might want to know , i'll explain this one . \nthis island earth is the tale of two scientists , a man and a woman , who wind up aboard a spaceship whose crew intends to destroy the earth . \ntogether the two fight to survive as well as save their home planet . \nto make mst3k work , the film-within-the-film naturally has to be as horrible as possible , and although the tv-series introduced us to several worse films than this island earth , it's a bad enough flick to bring about some hysterical cruelty . \nmst3k , which doesn't actually contain the complete this island earth , is a short 73 minutes , but this is a step very wisely taken . \nas funny as some of their observations are , it can only go so long . \noccasional breaks from this island earth also help the film tremendously . \nalthough it takes a second to get back into the right mode after this premise has been left for a moment , it's better than overkilling the whole concept post haste . \nmst3k lovers will likely hail the film greatly , but if you don't know what you're in for , it could be a jarring disappointment . \nalthough i thought the sharp wit of this film was worth three stars , it is a movie to be seen on home video , late at night when your brain is not functioning to full capacity anyway , and with a large , saracastic crowd - new year's at midnight for example , which is when i saw it . \nwarning : although mst3k has more to its end credits than most ( the three leads use the credits to poke some more fun ) , they are actually more annoying than most . \nthe name slandering and asinine one-liners were extremely unfunny , and after laughing for about 70 minutes straight , it put a heavy damper on the overall experience . \nmost people will likely stay to see what the smart-alec's have to say , but for me , it almost ruined an otherwise good film . \n", "any movie about the underground music scene is a difficult beast to master . \nany meaning found in the underground is usually lost by the dumbing-down of the experience to make it \" more accessible \" to the general public . \nor the film is produced and directed by people that have about enough understanding of the subject matter that they ought to work as production assistants for vh1 . \nhuman traffic , a new film exploring the british underground party/rave scene and the people immersed in the world of clubbing , pubbing , drugs , sex , and the beautiful , beautiful music , is an example of how it really ought to be done . \nthe film follows five brits in their young twenties during a wild weekend of parties , drugs , dancing , sex , pop culture discussions , relationships , and wanking off in front of a mirror while mum interrupts . \nthe cast of character consists of jip ( john simm ) , our narrator , who has a bit of a problem with his willy , known as mr . floppy . \nkoop ( shaun parkes ) , our black dj maestro , who has insecurity issues , afraid his girlfriend nina ( nicola reynolds ) is shagging other men . \nnina herself can't stand her mcjob and longs for the freedom of the weekends . \nlulu ( lorraine pilkington ) , jip's best mate , is tired of her cheating boyfriends . \nand moff ( danny dyer ) can't seem to escape the black hole of his awful life . \nthe film follows these five individuals during one weekend as each of them discovers love , friendship , and self-fulfillment , all against the raging party background . \nhuman traffic is proof that cinema can still tell us deep stories while being visually alive , as director justin kerrigan's subtle use of the camera lets the audience become part of the action . \nthe use of direct communication to the audience by the collection of characters works well , making the viewer the subconscious mind for the characters . \ndialogue is crisp and moves with an even pace , and the acting is confident . \nhowever , the two females leads tend to promote their relationships and dialogue with a bit of unneeded urgency that shows through when poignancy is needed . \nhuman traffic does not try to explain the rave scene . \ninstead , it gives the audience the ability to listen to the people inside it , letting you choose your own convictions about this powerful musical movement that brings together strangers , friends , and lovers for one blissful night of music and peace . \n", "steve martin took an extended vacation from all facets of moviemaking a few years back ; he spent this time writing essays and short stories for \" the new yorker , \" several of which wound up in his hilarious hardback compilation , pure drivel ( 1998 ) . \nmuch of the book spares tinseltown from mockery , although he does riff on the racist comments made by marlon brando during a larry king interview , in a fine chapter called \" in search of the wily filipino . \" \nnow , as writer and star of bowfinger , he offers the masses plenty of good reasons not to pursue a career in the cinema , perhaps finally venting the frustrations ( 'everything being made now is crap' ) that led to his brief retirement from hollywood . \nmartin stars as bobby bowfinger , a roger corman-wannabe on the cusp of fifty and desperate for some success as a producer , quality of the projects be damned . \nhis accountant ( adam alexi-malle ) proposes a movie called \" chubby rain , \" about aliens who travel to earth in raindrops slightly fatter than regular raindrops . \nbowfinger latches onto the idea immediately , and convinces his troupe of actor friends to appear in the film , based on the lie that america's top box office draw , kit ramsey ( murphy ) , has agreed to star . \nramsey , of course , wants nothing to do with such low-grade material , so bowfinger , on the thinking that action stars need to run , not speak , decides to photograph the superstar surreptitiously . \nhe sends his cast members ( who aren't in on it , either ; they are told ramsey hates the sight of cameras and fraternizing with his co-stars ) to ramsey's table at restaurants , asks them to follow him in parking lots , etc . , spouting script dialogue , all the while shooting the outcome from a great distance . \nthe paranoid ramsey flees the scene nearly every time . \nramsey is a member of mind head , a cultish self-help organization apparently dedicated to recruiting celebrities . \n ( as if that's not familiar enough , mind head guru terry stricter ( terence stamp ) has been dressed and combed to resemble l . ron hubbard , founder of scientology . ) \nwhen he goes to mind head with tales of caucasian strangers appearing from nowhere to babble \" white code \" in his face , they fear the nervous breakdown of an important client and rush him off to a retreat , requiring bowfinger to find a stand-in . \nmurphy will probably win more fans as jiff , ramsey's adorable , ignoramus double , than as kit , but it is his portrayal of the latter that took courage . \nalways surrounded by an entourage , suffering from a racial inferiority complex , murphy plays right into the tabloid image of himself . \nfurthermore , consider the enemies he'll make of popular scientologists . \npacing stricter's neutral-coloured office as if on an amphetamine binge and stripped of his bigshot veneer , ramsey is asked to shout inane personal affirmations repeatedly . \nmurphy's scenes with stamp are exactly what i imagine of a john travolta \" clearing . \" \nnot that murphy is entirely responsible for this schtick ; bowfinger is steve martin's invention . \nhis script is surprisingly clever as satire , given that the pseudo-religion is a sitting duck , as is the entire los angeles film industry . \n ( the griffin mill-types take quite a beating , in the form of robert downey jr . as bigwig jerry renfro . ) \nmartin's decision to tell the story from a bottom feeder's point of view is what keeps it fresh and innovative-never have we seen on screen a group of people struggle this hard to complete a motion picture . \nas expected , there are laughs only to be had insiders or buffs , such as martin's crew of mexican border-jumpers , who gain unexpected appreciation for the classics from reading \" cahiers du cinema , \" or martin's nonsensical explanation to dave , his loyal cinematographer ( jamie kennedy ) , that every movie , in the end , has a budget of two-thousand dollars ( ! ) . \nmost of bowfinger is universally funny , however ; i defy any viewer to keep a straight face when christine baranski , one of our brightest comediennes , is on screen . \nbowfinger's main flaw is a plot twist that has an insubstantial aftermath . \nwe're also asked to believe that a few simple close-ups of kit ramsey would redeem \" chubby rain , \" z-grade entertainment that would make ed wood blush . \n ( this aspect of bowfinger has much in common with the ludicrous oscar sequence in oz's last directorial effort , the poorly conceived in & out . ) \nthese are significant enough weaknesses that they distracted from my enjoyment of the piece . \nas i mentioned at the start of this review , bowfinger offers solid reasons not to do what heather graham's character daisy does : hop a bus to hollywood in search of stardom . \nthat said , it offers one fantastic reason to get on that bus : the sense of community between filmmakers who gel is awesome . \nmartin gets sentimental by story's end as he did in l . a . story , and how could he not ? \nfor those who can hack it , the movies might be the greatest business in the world . \n", ">from the man who presented us with henry : the portrait of a serial killer ( 6 . 5/10 ) \ncomes a wild tale set within the elite and white trash of florida's south coast . \nplot : guidance counselor ( dillon ) is accused of raping one of his students . \nshe happens to be the daughter of one of the wealthiest women in florida . \nthe counselor is brought to court on the charges , as another white trash girl ( campbell ) , also joins the rape finger-pointing club . \nas the story unfolds , we find that many things aren't exactly as they seem ( that's as much as i could say without ruining anything ) . \ncritique : good little flick that slows down at certain points , and runs a tad long , but generates enough twists and turns to keep most people interested throughout . \nmind you , i could see many people not liking it because it takes \" one too many \" twists and turns , but hey , i happen to like that kind of thing . \nand besides , the twists and turns in this movie managed to remain within the realm of believability ( or scathingly close to ) , and even \" explained \" many of its turns with a showcase of missed scenes during the credit crawl at the end of the film ( do not leave the theatre before you see the credits . . . it \nreally does clear up some stuff ! ! ) . \nother than that , the acting was good , with campbell transforming her \" good girl stereotypical \" role into a pot-smoking , goth-looking white trash chick out for a good time . \ndenise richards ( from starship troopers ( 7/10 ) fame ) solidifies herself as hollywood's jelly-donut pinup girl of the moment , and proves that all breast implants needn't lead to lawsuits . \nbacon is solid , and so is dillon ( while continuing to prove his inability to age to the whole wide wondering world ! ! ) . \nsprinkle the story with a bunch o' shots of alligators peeking through the swamp waters , bacon showing the world the size of his ding-dong ( do we really need to see this ? ? ) , a couple of lesbian kissing scenes , and a menage-a-trois , and you've got yourself a decent time at the movie theatre . \non the down side , the soundtrack was not as prominent ( or slick ) as i thought it would be , and theresa russell ( real name : theresa paup ) seems to have lost her way in every which way possible . . . . ooooh , \ni almost forgot bill murray's exquisite role as the down-trodden lawyer who agrees to defend dillon in court . \nmurray actually added that extra little spice of humour that allowed this film to affirm its position as a quirky little noirish tale of sex , greed and mystery . \nlittle known facts : neve campbell specified a non-nudity clause in her contract ( she's also born in guelph , ontario . . . go \nhoser ! ) \ndirector john mcnaughton says he deleted a scene that would have shown matt dillon and kevin bacon showering together , as it was gratuitous . \nkevin bacon plays in a band with his brother , called the bacon brothers , is married to actress kyra sedgwick , and has a game based on him called \" six degrees of kevin bacon \" . \n", "how many of us would become strippers ? \nfor those of us who wouldn't , is it a moral reason , or purely a lack of confidence ? \nthat's probably not a fair question , and for a lot of us , it could very well be for neither of those reasons . \nas you watch the full monty , however , you may begin asking yourself these kinds of questions . \nwould you be willing to grin and bare it to bring in some much needed dough ? \nin case you haven't guessed , the full monty is about stripping , but striptease it ain't . \nit's actually quite a charming comedy that uses its ideas with a great deal of tact and sophistication . \nit is the story of six out-of-work , out-of-shape blue collar brits whose recent job losses have left the boys penniless , but not without need . \nwhat to do ? \nit hits our main character gaz ( robert carlyle ) as he notices the large crowds of women who pour into a local male strip club on a regular basis . \nit seems that simple : take it off and bring in the cash . \neventually , gaz is able to convince his friends to join him in starting their own exotic dance routine despite their initial reluctance . \nthese include the overweight , confidence-lacking dave ( mark addy ) , the uptight , overly-officious gerald ( tom wilkinson ) , the once suicidal lomper ( steve huison ) , and two additional fellows who gain their place among the group by audition : horse ( paul barber ) , an older gentlemen chock full of graceless energy , and guy ( hugo speer ) , a young well-endowed looker who compares himself to cary grant . \nwhen the sextet is complete , we're given a hefty dose of physical comedy . \nwe watch the bumbling middle-aged men choreograph pseudo-sexy dance numbers , all the while proving why none of them were strippers in the first place . \nas if there anti-appeal wasn't enough , they decide to boost interest in the group by promising \" the full monty \" on opening night , which for us americans , means baring it all . \n . \n . \nand i mean * all * . \nthe movie actually ends on opening night ; a hilarious applause worthy ending i might add . \nit's sure to leave nothing short of a big smile on your face as you leave the theater . \nwith the subject matter , you might not expect the fully monty to be such a feel-good , almost inspiring film , but it surprisingly turns out that way . \nthe amount of light , touching drama also comes as a nice surprise , never feeling off-balance from the otherwise highly upbeat moments of the film . \nthere's a lot more to this movie than you might think in other words , and the ensemble cast couldn't be better . \neach character is completely individual , interesting , funny , and most importantly , real . \nthe full monty is never offensive , a very impressive attribute since its subject matter alone could've easily fallen prey to tastelessness . \nit's one of those movies that is best described as a solid piece of entertainment , perfect for a great night on the town , or as a saturday night movie rental . \neither way you see it , it shouldn't let you down in the slightest . \nand , pun heavily intended , when it's all said and done , you'll be smiling from cheek to cheek . \n", "director dominic sena ( who made the highly underrated kalifornia ) and producer jerry bruckheimer ( the rock , armageddon ) bring us a slick and entertaining remake of the 1974 film of the same name that absolutely no one has ever seen . \nnicolas cage plays memphis , a retired car thief who's \" pulled back in \" to the business by an evil car thief overlord ( christopher eccleston ) determined to kill memphis' kid brother ( giovanni ribisi ) . \nmemphis is ordered to steal 50 cars in four days time or his brother will meet an unfortunate demise , all while having to elude the detectives hot on his trail and a rival car thief who feels the job should have been given to him and his gang . \nmemphis sets out to put his old crew back together , but discovers that most of them have retired as well . \ngone in sixty seconds does things right from the opening credits . \nin that sequence , we get a rockin' little tune from moby , along with some simple back story told only with photographs and assorted objects . \nfilmmakers can sometimes make or break a film just from its opening title sequence , and this one easily gets you in the mindset for an entertaining ride . \nand what follows doesn't disappoint . . . \ncage turns in one of his good performances here ( he can easily go either way . . . \ngood or bad . . . \ni don't know how he does that ) , and his mannerisms and dialogue delivery carry the film along nicely . \nof the supporting cast members , angelina jolie as memphis' former love is in the film just to provide eye candy ( she's definitely the hottest looking grease monkey i've ever seen ) and robert duvall as memphis' former mentor is just around to lend the film some class . \nalso , i'm a big fan of will patton ( armageddon , the postman ) and would love to see him get a huge role someday . \nnone of these three performers are given much to do unfortunately . \nsome underrated performers however are given meaty supporting roles . \ndelroy lindo ( get shorty ) shines as the exasperated detective in pursuit of memphis , as does timothy olyphant ( go ) as lindo's partner . \ni just wish some of the other characters could have been as important . \nthe only real gripe i have about the film though is its conclusion . . . \nmainly because you know how it will end before the opening credits even roll . \nthere's no doubt in anyone's mind that the 50 cars will be successfully stolen , and the filmmakers blew a perfectly good opportunity to add some suspense to the picture by using the \" rival car thief \" plot line . \nas it stands , that story line is wrapped up about halfway through the film in a tidy little package . \nbut if i was making this film , i'd have had the rival gang trying to get to the cars before memphis and his crew , thereby making memphis have to improvise . . . \nthereby adding some meat to the plot . \nthe finale is essentially just a big car chase , and there just aren't ways to make car chases interesting anymore . \nit's all been done . \nthe chase is also shot and edited in that \" jerry bruckheimer action sequence \" kind of way that leaves the audience wondering what specifically is going on in the scene . \nsure it's a car chase , but what exactly are the particulars of it ? \nit's very hard to tell . \nfinally , there's a stunt during this scene that comes close to challenging the \" bus jumping the ramp \" sequence from speed in the \" oh , i don't think so . . . \" \ndepartment . \ndespite those minor complaints , gone in sixty seconds is pure summer movie entertainment . \nit's not thought provoking , but it's shiny , loud and fun . . . \njust what a summer flick should be . \n[pg-13] \n", "books could be , and indeed have been written about the star wars trilogy , and rightfully so . \nthis is a set of movies that shattered all expectations of what science fiction could be in the late 70s/early 80s , inspiring literally dozens of clones , from battlestar galactica all the way up to stargate and independance day , and one could argue revitalizing the whole science fiction genre . \nthe special effects were groundbreaking , revolutionary for their day and still eminently watchable well into twenty years later . \nliterally millions of people have seen the star wars trilogy and been touched by it . \nand now , george lucas brings it back for a new audience to enjoy . \nmuch has been and is still being made of the fact that mr . lucas has gone back and revised his trilogy for rerelease now . \nsome fans are angry that he has dared to meddle with what they consider perfection , while others are thrilled by the idea of seeing yesterday's star wars updated with today's special effects wizardry . \neither way , the special edition release means that star wars is back on the big screen , where it rightfully deserves to be seen . \ncan there be anyone in the world who doesn't know what star wars is about ? \nin a way , star wars is so much a part of our cultural heritage that it feels silly and almost artificial to try to summarize it . \nit's a story about a young man's coming of age , a fight for freedom against an oppressive empire , a tale of swashbuckling and derring-do the likes of which haven't been seen on the silver screen in decades , strange new worlds with strange alien creatures and weird surprises around every turn , and the yearning within each of us to realize our dreams and make a difference in the world . \nit's high adventure , incredible special effects , and . . . well , it's just an _experience_ . \nsomething about this movie sparked the imagination of a generation . . . and \nit's about to do so again . \nthis new release of star wars comes as no surprise to many of the film's devoted fans , who have been trading rumors and bits of information about it for quite some time now . \ninterviews , trailers , leaks from within lucasfilm . . . all of these have been collected , collated , and placed on webpages for people to see ( pages such as http : //www . islandnet . com/~corona/films/details/sw4 . html \nor , my personal favorite , http : //leopard . cs . latrobe . edu . au/~koukoula/ \n ) . \npictures of before and after have been placed side by side . . . even \nmonths before the movies were released , fans were making comparisons . \nin some cases , the changes were nothing less than phenomenal , and this can be seen from the comparison shots even before you go into the movie theater . \nthe digital matte effects that were little more than a toy in forrest gump are put to excellent use here , unnoticeably sprucing up scenes that that george lucas was unsatisfied with in the original . \nfor instance , in my personal favorite example , the ancient temple on yavin that was formerly a flat stone edifice now has deep , moss-covered carvings and etchings . \nand mos eisley spaceport is now a bustling , booming city , with more surprises and things going on in the background than you can notice on the first viewing . \nall the starships and fighters are now computer-animated , getting rid of glitches and artifacts of the special effects processes used when the film was originally made--and they look _fantastic_ . \nfour and a half minutes of new or missing footage have been added , including a scene with jabba the hutt that had originally been shelved because the state of special effects in 1977 simply couldn't do it justice . \nhowever , much of the ten million dollars that was spent on the star wars special edition restoration went into restoring the quality of the film itself . \nthe negatives , badly damaged by the ravages of time , were brightened and returned to their original splendor . \nthe audio tracks were remixed and reprocessed , with reworked sound effects by effects maven ben burtt , into glorious , booming , theater-shaking full-thx dolby digital stereo . \nand _that_ , more than the added scenes or new special effects , is where the real value of this new version lies . \nit's really true what they say in the commercials : star wars loses _so much_ on the small screen . \neven letterboxing doesn't make up for the decrease in size and definition . \nin regard to the star wars special edition , and to the other two films of the trilogy which have yet to be released , i'll make this final recommendation : go and see it . \ngo and see it more than once . . . it \nmay be another twenty years before it comes back to the big screen after it's gone this time . \ntake along the youngsters who've never had the big-screen star wars experience--you'll enjoy seeing it through their eyes as much as they will enjoy it for the first time . \nthere's magic in this movie--special edition or no , there can be no denying that it's still star wars , and still has the power to thrill and enthrall children of all ages , from four to four hundred . \nlet's all return to that time long ago , and that galaxy far , far away . . . \n", "eddie murphy has had his share of ups and downs during his career . \nknown for his notorious late 80's slump , murphy has still managed to bounce back with a handful of hits in the past few years . \nwith the exception of the dreadful holy man , he appears to be on pace for a full-fledged comeback . \nlife was a great move on the part of murphy and co-star martin lawrence , because it's a great showcase for both actors that never resorts to slap-sticky drivel . \ndirector ted demme is smart enough to realize that the two comedians can generate enough genuine laughs on their own , and doesn't insert a distracting plot to back them up . \nlife is , in a sense , one great balancing act with murphy on one end and lawrence on the other . \namazingly , the scale never tips in either's favor due to the marvelous chemistry and wonderful contrast that each actor allows the other . \nas the movie opens , we're introduced to ray gibson ( eddie murphy ) , a two-timing pickpocket who schmoozes his way into a club . \nthere he meets a successful businessman named claude banks ( martin lawrence ) . \nsomehow , after multiple contrivances , the mismatched pair find themselves on their way to mississippi on a moonshine run . \nwhen all is said and done , ray and claude have been framed for a murder that was actually committed by the town sheriff . \nhence the setting of life : mississippi state prison , where the main characters come to realize their unlikely friendship is important , and become set on finding an fool-proof escape plan . \nthe film takes us from the 30's all the way to the 90's , presenting a difficult task in showing how the aging process affects ray and claude . \nluckily , rick baker handles the makeup effects of the two actors in a fantastic , academy award caliber manner . \nnot only do we believe the characters look as if they're 90 years old , but they sound like it , too . \nmurphy and lawrence are completely convincing in the lead roles , even as crotchety old cons bickering over a game of cards . \nthis is just one of the pleasant surprises that the film has tucked up it's sleeve . \nwhile the ads are marketing life as a straight arrow comedy , there is a hefty amount of dramatic material hidden at it's core . \nbut the comedic aspects work wonderfully , wisely drawing strength from the talents of the two stars . \nthe movie is more of a comedy than it is a drama , but in both senses , it's an overwhelming delight . \ni could say a few bad things about the movie , but i don't want to . \nit's such a nice surprise , such a great vehicle for eddie murphy and martin lawrence , that it warrants a huge smile as the credits begin to roll . \n", "cinematically speaking , gordon parks' original 1971 _shaft_ is not a great film . \na bit slow at times and more than a little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action , this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidyman's \" black private dick that's a sex machine to all the chicks \" to the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking . \nyet nearly 30 years after its original release--and long after the genre it spawned , \" blaxploitation , \" died with that decade--the 1971 _shaft_ remains an extremely entertaining watch , never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness . \nthe reason for this is the same one that explains the film's connection with moviegoers far beyond the target african-american audience : the title character of john shaft . \nwhile the fact that the strong , smart , virile , and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance , his broad-based appeal stems from an idea that transcends race : he is comfortable , confident , and proud about who he is , and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his ass . \nthis fact also explains why john singleton's y2g revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is . \nmuch like the film that started the franchise , this _shaft_'s plot doesn't score points in the originality department , but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers . \ncontrary to what has been reported over the past few months , this _shaft_ is not a remake of the original film , but more of a sequel/spinoff . \nthe star audiences know and love from the original film and its first two sequels ( 1972's _shaft's_big_score ! _ and 1973's _shaft_in_africa_ ) , richard roundtree , once again plays john shaft , who still runs a private investigation firm in new york city . \nhowever , the focus of the film lies on his same-named nephew ( samuel l . jackson ) , who , as the film begins , is a cop whose take-no-crap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors . \nwhen a privileged young man named walter wade jr . ( christian bale ) accused of a brutal , racially-motivated murder is allowed to be released on bail , a disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own hands as a p . i . \nbut that's easier said than done , for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez ( jeffrey wright ) , a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri ( toni collette ) , the only eyewitness to his crime . \npeoples--or , rather , wright is also the big obstacle in jackson's way toward commanding this film . \npeoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time , and wright is insanely funny during these stages . \nhowever , he isn't so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish , and peoples' eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable ( which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo , who bowed out before filming ) . \nit's no easy task to steal a film from the jackson ( who is his usual captivating , charismatic self here ) , but that's exactly what wright does--and makes it seem effortless . \nthen again , with such a talented ensemble surrounding him , it is not too surprising that jackson's impressive star turn doesn't quite tower over the rest ; he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other co-stars . \nbale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in _american_psycho_ , so it only follows that his performance as a similar , less exaggerated character would be spot-on . \ncollette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened , conflicted diane . \nbusta rhymes brings some good laughs as shaft's sidekick rasaan . \nregistering not as strongly--but through no fault of their own--are vanessa williams ( as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez ) and a dismayingly underused roundtree ; they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price , singleton , and shane salerno . \n ( jackson also has little to \" do \" in a sense ; some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside , his shaft doesn't even have one sex scene . ) \nthat singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an especially good thing since he's not really an action director . \nthis is not to say that he does a bad job with the numerous gunfights and the requisite foot and car chases . \nthey move well ( as does the film as a whole ) and are reasonably exciting ; it's just that there's nothing terribly inventive about them . \nthese set pieces are functional in the way the script is : they work well enough , but they're unsurprising and conventional . \nbut if there's anything that a _shaft_ movie does well , it's make the familiar look cool--and this _shaft_ keeps that tradition alive . \nfrom the slick title sequence--scored , of course , to isaac hayes' ever-infectious oscar-winning theme song , which singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the film--on , the film looks great and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado . \neven a common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only feels unforced , it feels necessary . \nstyle doesn't exactly make for a great film , but when it comes to _shaft_ , that's of little consequence . \nwhat matters above all else is having a good time , and the latest _shaft_ should be just the first of many fun rides to be had with this bad mutha--shut your mouth . \n", "uncompromising french director robert bresson's \" lancelot of the lake \" achieves the exact opposite effect of sir thomas malory's \" morte darthur . \" \ninstead of enshrining the legend of king arthur and his knights of the round table , it dethrones them by revealing arthur as a weak , ineffectual leader and the knights as a group of jealous , bickering men who failed to live up to the legends prescribed to them . \nchivalry has no place in \" lancelot of the lake , \" except as that of a dying ideal . \nbresson begins his tale as the knights of the round table are returning , decimated , after failing merlin's command to retrieve the holy grail , the mystical cup that was filled with christ's blood . \nbresson immediately gives us his impression of the essential meaning of the grail quest : bloodshed and failure . \nthe opening sequence is a series of clumsy , disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights -- a head is hacked off , a stomach is impaled , a skull is split open , skeletal remains hang from trees , and burning bodies smolder in the ruins of a flaming house . \nsince the film starts with camelot in near-ruin , and takes only an hour and a half to arrive at its inevitable conclusion , it doesn't carry the grand , tragic resonance of other arthurian films . \nwe never get to see camelot at the peak of its power , therefore there is no real downfall to witness . \nbut , then again , it is not the name of camelot that is evoked in the title of the film . \nrather , it is lancelot , and bresson is more interested in the internal battle within his heart , than the external downfall of a kingdom . \nlancelot has always been a tragic figure in the arthurian tales , and bresson uses him as the central figure to explore the battle between the spirit and the flesh . \nthe greatest of all knights , he was flawed only in his love for arthur's wife , queen guinevere , and it was that illicit affair that eventually caused the downfall of camelot . \neven when lancelot attempts to end the affair with guinevere ( laura duke condominas ) , he only finds himself falling back into her arms against his better judgment . \nhe knows it means the destruction of the idealized kingdom , but he is powerless in his passion . \nwhen sir mordred ( patrick bernhard ) accuses lancelot of the affair , other knights , including sir gawain ( humbert balsan ) spring to lancelot's defense . \nit is this battle within the knights that is the eventual undoing of the round table ; the flesh wins out over the spirit , and the consequences are dire . \nbresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the interiors of men's hearts and minds . \n \" lancelot of the lake \" is filled with his particular trademarks : a stripped-down , minimalist style , flat , expressionless dialogue , and a grand use of natural sounds in place of music . \nhe uses background music only twice in the film , during an opening narration segment and during the opening credits . \nthe music here is a heavy drumbeat and accompanying bagpipes , but the rest of the film is scored with natural sounds that punctuate the film's thematic elements : the incessant clanking and creaking of heavy armor , the neighing of horses , the rhythm of hooves beating down dirt roads , and the natural chirping and whispering of the forest . \nlike most of his other films , bresson employed nonprofessional actors who recite the dialogue in emotionless , flat voices . \nall the actors he used in \" lancelot of the lake \" had never acted before , and with the exception of patrick bernhard , they never acted again . \nnever once do they raise their voices or put any emphasis on a given word . \ninstead of using vocal inflection , bresson strove to create emotion through images . \nin some ways , this technique works ; in other ways , it doesn't . \nthe final montage of arthur's men battling each other is quite marvelous , and the final image of the knights in shining armor reduced to a literal scrap-pile sums up the entire film in one moment . \nhowever , other times bresson's uncompromising methods are distracting and questionable . \nfor instance , during an important jousting contest , bresson films the majority of the action so that the only things visible are the horses' legs . \nhe does this repeatedly , opening each shot with the same few notes from a bagpipe and the raising of a different flag . \nwhile there might be symbolic value in this , the resulting experience of watching it can be bothersome . \nnevertheless , \" lancelot of the lake \" is a fascinating cinematic experience boldly made by a master filmmaker . \nbresson's style may not be for everyone , but one has to respect his strength as an artist . \nby re-evaluating the arthurian legends and making them his own , he turns \" lancelot of the lake \" into something rare in modern cinema : a truly personal film . \n", "capsule : the best place to start if you're a jackie chan newcomer . \nroars along , never stops for breath , and frequently hilarious . \nto talk about jackie chan as a \" stuntman \" is to miss a million things . \njackie is not only one of the most accomplished and fearsomely unafraid physical adepts on the screen today , but also a very funny guy . \nhe reminds me of the way arnold schwartzenegger * used * to make me laugh -- he's funny just standing there , copping a look . \nsupercop has jackie making us laugh , scream , duck , root , and gasp for breath , often all in the same scene . \nit's actually the third in a loosely related series of movies , each with jackie playing kevin chan , a hong kong policeman who has a knack for getting neck-deep into trouble and then karate-kicking his way out of it . \n ( the others are also worth seeing . ) \nit's a little slow to start , but once it gets moving , it's a field day . \nthe movie has a fairly sophisticated plot for movies of this kind . \nkevin is tapped for a dangerous dea assignment to be accomplished in mainland china , which requires him to collaborate with the attractive ( and ass-kicking ) chief fo chinese security ( played here by the ever-enjoyable michelle yeoh ) . \nthere's a fun chemistry between the two of them , especially in an early scene where she tries to brief him and he keeps making wondering comments about how great she looks in that uniform . \nkevin is assigned to help spring a known gangster from jail -- all undercover , of course -- and have him lead the two of them to a noted drug boss . \nthe drug boss , however , has problems of his own : his wife's on trial for many of his own crimes , and she's got the key to an account with all of his drug funds . \nthis means , of course , endless trouble -- not the least of which is that kevin bumps into his girlfriend while he's out in the field , and she sees him with this other woman , and . . . but that's one of the movie's unique pleasures : the way it crosses from action to comedy effortlessly . \naction . there is , of course , non-stop action in this movie -- everything from one-on-one kung fu to all-out gun battles to a sppedboat with eight engines ( ! ) \noutrunning the hong kong coast guard . \nthere is also a virtuoso climax , which features , among other things , jackie danging from a ladder tied to a helicopter , a wrong-way freeway chase ( which requires michelle to do an awesomely difficult handstand stunt ) , a fight on top of a moving train that also involves the 'copter as well as a motorcycle . \nyou get the idea . \nthis is to action movies what a burger with everything on it is to fast food : quick , enjoyable , filling . \nwatch it with friends . \nwhen they stop making movies like this , the world will be a tad greyer . \n", "the calendar year has not even reached its midway point , but that hasn't prevented columbia pictures from trotting out a lavish period drama more befitting of the winter oscar-bait season . \nbille august's high-profile adaptation of victor hugo's classic les miserables delivers everything one would expect from a classy hollywood epic--handsome production values , strong performances by a top-notch cast , a literate screenplay--with one critically missing element : emotional sweep . \nfor those not familiar with hugo's original novel or the hit stage musical it inspired , the hook of les miserables essentially boils down to something like a 19th-century french-set version of the fugitive . \nafter serving 19 years in a prison work camp for stealing a loaf of bread , the brutish jean valjean ( liam neeson ) is paroled . \nimmediately upon release , he steals valuable silverware from a kindly bishop who takes him in for a night ; he is caught by authorities , only to be forgiven by the bishop , who lets valjean keep the silver to start a new life on the straight and narrow . \nthat he does , and in doing so breaks his parole , which sets the obsessively determined inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) , who was one of the guards in valjean's prison camp , on his trail . \nthematically , however , les miserables is a story about redemption , which valjean finds through his dealings with two women , the hard-luck factory-worker-turned-prostitute fantine ( uma thurman ) , and her illegitimate daughter , cosette . \nyears after breaking parole , valjean becomes mayor of the town of vigau , where he forms a warm friendship with fantine after saving her from an unjust arrest by javert . \nvaljean promises the gravely ill fantine he will rescue the young cosette ( mimi newman ) from her cruel caretakers , the thenardiers , and raise the child as his own . \nthe \" father \" and \" daughter \" eventually land in paris , where the teenage cosette ( claire danes ) falls for dashing student revolutionary marius ( hans matheson ) . \nthe decades-spanning story is the stuff that cinematic epics are made of , and the danish august turns in his most accomplished english-language work , following the underrated 1994 superstar soap the house of the spirits and last year's stylish but highly preposterous mystery smilla's sense of snow . \nhe and screenwriter rafael yglesias bring the sprawling tale into clear focus and keep the events moving at a brisk pace . \nproduction designer anna asp , costume designer gabriella pescucci , and cinematographer jorgen persson give les miserables a sumptuous period look whose accomplishment is mostly matched by the efforts of the cast . \nneeson is commanding yet endearingly vulnerable ; rush's finely modulated menace is far more rewarding than his overrated , oscar-winning theatrics in shine ; and thurman disappears nicely into her highly unglamorous role . \nthe younger members of the cast fare less well . \ndanes is convincing as cosette , but her overdone lip quivering during her crying scenes becomes a distraction ; and matheson , while competent , is a less interesting robert sean leonard . \nas technically adept and cerebrally engaging the film is , by the time les miserables was over , my emotions had only been superficially involved . \nwhile i was touched by valjean's relationships with fantine and cosette , i was not moved . \nnot even reaching the \" touching \" level is the cosette-marius pairing . \nmy only previous experience with les miserables is with the musical ( as i am sure many others' is ) , and i was dismayed to see eponine , a friend of marius's who selflessly dies in the name of her unspoken love for him , almost completely jettisoned from this adaptation ( the daughter of the thenardiers , here she is only briefly seen as a child ) . \nher presence would have added some much-needed conflict and emotional heft to the youthful romance , but i suppose august and yglesias felt one tragic heroine ( fantine ) was enough . \neven so , as 1998 creeps into summer blockbuster season , les miserables is a thoughtful , well-made , entertaining film , one that will sate moviegoers hungry for a dose of drama before popcorn no-brainers invade the multiplex . \n", "an entertaining 2 hours awaits the audience in this film set in the early 80's . \nsevigny and beckinsale play disco chicks alice and charlotte , who are on the lookout for love . \nalice is mousy , shy , intellectual , charlotte is bitchy , out-going and fun . \nwe join their adventures as they go through a variety of adventures , and men , all to the background of the local disco . \nwhit stillman has both written and directed an interesting and believable story . \nalice and charlotte are both well written characters , and the actresses who play them aren't bad aswell . \nsevigny delivers an honest performance , and makes the audience feel for her character . \nbeckinsale plays extreme bitch personified , yet her character never becomes completely unlikeable . \nthe huge supporting cast also play a part in making sure this movie is thoroughly entertaining . \nthe dialogue is sharp and well written , with many funny set pieces . \nfor example , there's a great discussion about lady & the tramp by the main characters . \nthe disco tunes playing in the background also make sure that this admittedly long film is good fun . \nthe direction is good , bringing out the drama and comedy in the scenes . \nbut their are slight flaws with the movie . \nfirstly , although it is supposedly set in the 80's , the characters are very , very 90's . \nthe way they dress and act have a very 90's feel to them . \nalthough the male hairstyles look slightly 80's , frankly the 80's atmosphere just wasn't conveyed , which is a shame . \nalso , as mentioned above , the film is too long , and some parts do lag . \nthe charm of the characters do help these moments , but generally the editing could of been a bit tighter . \nthe plot also side-tracks into a silly cocaine dealing bust , which seemed out of place in this movie . \nfinally , their are almost too many characters in the film , and despite the running time , the film never really spends enough time on them . \nsome of the characters are very slight , which is a shame . \nthe conclusion , while funny , is also surprisingly weak , and certainly not strong enough . \nbut despite these qualms , the last days of disco is a funny , warm movie , which is certainly worth seeing , and is a fitting homage to the disco era of the 80's . \nworth a look . \noverall rating= \nreview by david wilcock ? 1998 \n \" you know , for kids \" - norville barnes \n", "gordon fleming ( peter mullan ) is in a bind . \nhe has a new , unexpected baby and his business , hazardous material removal , is in danger of going under . \nwhen he and his crew get a job opportunity at the long-abandoned danvers state hospital , he underbids the competition to secure the contract and promises to get the three-week job done in one . \nit will prove to be a fateful week for them all in \" session 9 . \" \ngordo gets the job to remove asbestos and other hazardous materials from the spooky old mental hospital in preparation for relocating town offices there . \ntheir guided tour of the facility by a local official , bill giggs ( paul guilfoyle ) , brings them through some of the creepier parts of the former asylum . \nbut , a job is a job and , if they finish in a week , as promised , there is a $10000 bonus in store . \nas they get down to their work , things , normal and not so normal , begin to happen . \ngordon hears a disembodied voice beckoning him . \nphil ( david caruso ) is conflicted working with a guy , hank ( josh lucas ) , who is seeing his old girlfriend . \nmike ( co-screenwriter steven gevedon ) has discovered a cache of audiotapes and transcripts from old psychiatric sessions ( hence , the title ) with inmate mary hobbs , a multi-personality patient with a dark secret . \ngordo's nephew , jeff ( brendan sexton iii ) , suffers from night phobia and is afraid to venture into the dark bowels of the hospital . \nas the agreed upon week draws to an end , hank mysteriously disappears from the workplace after a nocturnal confrontation with someone ( something ? ) in the hospital . \ntensions mount and distrust build among the rest as they watch their chance for the bonus start to slip away . \nbut , there is more , much more , at stake as the hospital and its history of insanity weigh on them all . \ni don't want to give away too much of the story of \" session 9 , \" so i'll stop there . \nwhat we have here is a spooky horror flick that uses none of the jump-out-at-you-from-the-dark cheap shots that have become part and parcel with horror films since the advent of \" halloween \" and \" friday the thirteenth . \" \nthere is no cat leaping out of the dark or the shock of suddenly seeing oneself in a strategically placed mirror . \nwith the exception of one shadowy and chilling image at one point spooky interlude in the film , there is little that you can get your arms around as far as what , specifically , is \" frightening . \" \nas i watched \" session 9 \" i became aware of the subtle things that built up during the story that make it a true horror movie . \nthe striking high-definition video camera work by uta briesewitz ( who worked with the director , brad anderson , on his \" next stop wonderland \" ) helps to build up tension with close-ups , fluid camera movement and odd angles in a way that would make alfred hitchcock proud . \nmusic , too , is used to intense effect , joining with the camera to make simple scenes frightening , even horrifying . \ncouple these tech feats with an intelligent story that uses elements of \" the shining , \" \" the blair witch project \" and , even \" the texas chainsaw massacre \" and you get a decent , intriguing horror flick . \nadditionally , the brilliant decision to shoot at danvers state hospital gives the film another starring character , the institution itself , which lends even more chills to the equation . \nacting is another factor that raises \" session 9 \" above the usual dreck presented in recent horror hits like \" scream , \" \" i know what you did last summer \" and their sequels . \nthose films took good-looking , though generic , young actors and actresses and put them to use to build up a body count , substituting mayhem for real horror . \nanderson opted , instead , to use mature , experienced actors like peter mullan and david caruso to fill his characters' shoes and the difference in casting quality is notable . \nmullan , in particular , puts an arc on his character , gordon , as the troubled guy who slowly and inexorably falls under the pressures of family , job and , finally , danvers state hospital . \nthe rest of the small cast fit the bill as people , not just fodder for the mayhem . \ndavid caruso , as gordo's senior man and near equal in the business , shows just how good an actor he is . \nhe made the jump from tv's \" nypd blue \" to film far too soon and his decisions in the roles he took ( i'll never forget the horrendous \" jade \" ) were less than star making . \nhe rolls his sleeves up and does the job well here . \ngevedon , lucas and sexton are more than fodder , too . \nthe only problem with \" session 9 \" lay in the uninspired ending . \nit takes on a fairly conventional finale that covers old ground and is a bit of a disappointment after the terrific ( and inspired ) build up . \nthe pleasure is getting there and i wish that anderson and gevedon had kept up the steam they had so ably built during the bulk of the film \n \" session 9 \" is an unusual feat . \nit is scary , doesn't use cheap tricks and raises goose bumps with its intelligently rendered , subtle horror . \nbecause of the local interest of danvers , it should do well with the northeast crowd . \ni hope it gets the national distribution it deserves . \ni give it a b+ . \n", "the latest epos from lars is a blast , although a rather moody one . \nthis lovestory is situated in a small town in the rough dreary cliffs in the vestern part of scotland in the 1970 something . \nthe church (

to him in every detail . \nat first she resist , but her love for jan and his assurance that this will make him recover more rapidly make her comply . \nimagine what this is doing to the poor girl ? \nthe story is cleverly divided into eight chapters parted by beautiful pictures made by danish artist per kirkeby , accompanied by music from the era ; procol harum , deep purple , t-rex and others . \nthe use of hand-held camera and lack of any make-up make the characters solid and help to separate this movie from others in the sentimental genre . \nthe incredible performance from the actors makes the movie brilliant , though a bit too gloomy for my taste . \ni would say that it is in the genre of betty blue ( 37 . 2 le matin ) and bitter moon ( lunes de fiel ) . \nemily watson as bess and katrin cartlidge as her best friend dodo deliver outstanding performances , this must be the reason for giving it the \" grand prix du jury \" in cannes this year ( although we had hoped for the \" palme d'or \" ) . \nthe screenplay is now available in print , the transformation being made in the period from ultimo may to july , just in time for the danish premiere . \n", "anastasia contains something that has been lacking from all of the recent disney releases . . . \n ( especially hercules ) . . . \nemotion . \nall the wacky characters voiced by celebrities and fantastically animated adventure sequences aren't going to hold anyone's interest unless there is an emotional core to hold it all together . \nnot since disney's beauty & the beast has there been such a compelling animated film with interesting characters and drama that works . \nthe story of the romanov family , the rulers of russia , and their downfall begins the film . \nanastasia , one of the daughters , narrowly escapes the mad monk rasputin ( voiced by christopher lloyd ) with her grandmother ( voiced by angela landsbury ) . \nbut anastasia gets lost , and grows up with no memory of her royal origins . \nthe grandmother lives in paris , hoping to someday find her beloved anastasia , the only member of the family to survive the russian revolution . \na young woman named anya ( voiced by meg ryan ) runs across dimitri ( john cusack ) and vlad ( kelsey grammar ) , who are trying to put together a scheme to create an anastasia to fool the grandmother and get the reward money . \nthey pick anya to pose as their princes , and of course , it is soon revealed that anya is in fact the lost anastasia . \ndimitri realizes that he can never win her love as he is a commoner , and meanwhile , rasputin is not dead , and plots his revenge against the last romanov . \nthe plot is actually quite well structured . \nthere are a lot of complexities that may have to be explained to the kids later , but it moves along fast enough that they'll never have time to be bored . \nwhat this really means is that the adults won't be bored by it either . \nthere is a great deal of banter between anya and dimitri that is very funny , and their relationship develops quite naturally as the film progresses . \nthere is , of course , lots of comedy for the kids , including rasputin's pet bat , bartok ( hank azaria ) , who is easily the funniest thing in the film . \nhowever , the comical scenes never distract from the drama , but are worked into the plot almost seamlessly . \nthe animation is gorgeous - the characters seem to come to life through the talented animators . \nnot since beauty & the beast have animated characters had so much life to them . \neven without the voices , they act . \nthe musical number in paris is a show-stopper , with some of the backgrounds rendered in an impressionist painting style . \nas with all recent animated features , there are songs , however , these songs do more than just provide fodder for top-40 singers to get on the radio ( although there are three of them during the end credits ) . \nthe songs are all very catchy , and advance the plot , instead of just being showpieces ( except for the paris number , but that's so much fun , it's okay . . . ) . \ni can't reccomend anastasia highly enough . \nit's a wonderful film that ranks right up there with other animated classics . \nkids and adults alike will enjoy it , and it's also nice to have a quality animated feature film from another studio besides disney . \n", "i can hear the question already . \nwhat on earth do these two movies have in common ? \nto most people , not a lot , except that both are by renowned directors . \nas i saw them , however , both movies have flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers . \nbut oh , how differently the packages affect their films . \nwhile \" everyone's \" production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special , jane campion's imaginative visuals only serve to emphasize how pompous and uninvolving laura jones' script is . \ni left \" everyone says i love you \" not remembering a lot about who loved whom , but its infectious happiness put a grin on my face . \ni left \" the portrait of a lady \" not remembering a lot about who loved whom , and i could have cared less . \n \" everyone \" features nothing allen hasn't done before storywise . \nwoody is again desperately in love with a beautiful woman ( roberts ) , and against the odds they manage to click for awhile before allen is left wondering what went wrong--again . \nsimilar situations happen to his family and friends . \nsome of the more outlandish comedy scenes even hark back to his \" early , funny \" films . \nthe scenes between tim roth and drew barrymore could have come out of \" take the money and run , \" his directorial debut . \nhowever , nothing allen has ever done prepared me for this one-of-a-kind display of sheer good spirits . \nin fact , in this movie , the feeling itself is what's most important . \nyes , the movie would have been better--among his very best , i think--if it had a meatier story . \nbut what it lacks in substance it makes up for in feeling . \nand what better way to express feeling than through music ? \nlove is often best expressed in a song , and the numbers the cast break into here cut straight to the heart . \nsome are a tad too goofy , such as the number where a lot of ghosts prance around in a funeral parlor , but i admired allen for even putting them in there . \nit also helps that as usual , allen has a top-flight cast working with him . \ntheir singing voices range from quite good ( goldie hawn ) to not quite good ( allen ) to literally unlistenable ( barrymore , whose real voice was dubbed by a professional ) . \nbut while their vocal abilities differ , all the actors do a great job of putting joy up there on the screen , and making it rub off on the audience . \ngranted , some people will simply never accept characters singing in movies , but for those attuned to it , this film should work wonders . \njane campion , too , has a top-flight cast working for her in \" portrait of a lady , \" too , but even their considerable skills can do nothing to keep the film from being a stilted , virtually lifeless mess , albeit a visually interesting one . \ncampion and her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come up with a great variety of eye-filling images that linger in the mind . \nunfortunately , what didn't linger in the mind for me was the story the visuals were supposed to be reflecting . \ni remember very well shots of a train with its light beaming and shots of men vanishing around nicole kidman , but i can remember very little of what happened between all these people . \neven worse , i don't find myself feeling bad that i've forgotten . \nthe problem , i think , lies not with the cast , which seemed to be trying very hard for the material . \nit was the script that couldn't convince me to care about anyone . \nthe characters were putting out all kinds of emotion , but i found no reason to connect with any of them . \ni understood that the story was about cold , emotionally vacant characters , but for me to care about them , i have to identify with them somehow and want them to inject feeling into their lives . \njones' script never simply gave me that opportunity . \nin the end , it almost seemed as if campion was trying to inject some life of her own into the proceedings with her visual flourishes . \nunfortunately , as she kept painting these dazzling pictures , they only served to push me further away from the material and remind me that there was no connection between me and the film . \nin the end , the movie's one strength ended up hurting it . \nso here we have two films with pretty uninteresting plots , and yet i was able to truly enjoy one of them . \nwhy ? \nwith both films , my head cared about neither story , but only \" everyone says i love you \" was able to make my heart sing . \n", "you've got to think twice before you go see a movie with a title like maximum risk . \nthe title is generic . \nit's meaningless . \nand i can't believe it's good business . \nwhen you pick up the phone and dial 777-film , how in the world are you supposed to remember that the new jean-claude van damme movie , the one that looked kind of cool in the trailers and is directed by some chinese hot shot , is called , geez , maximum risk ? \nyuck . \nthe movie itself deserves your attention . \nfor sweet bloody thrills , this one beats the summer blockbuster competition hands-down . \nonly mission : impossible came close to delivering as skillful a thriller , and i'll give maximum risk the edge simply because it's not as slick as the tom cruise picture , and therefore more gratifying in its execution . \nmuch to my surprise , van damme continues to develop as a pleasant , unpretentious action hero . \nhis track record isn't as solid as schwarzenegger's , but he's a hell of a lot more adventurous than arnold . \nin 1993 , van damme worked with hong kong's premier hardcore action director , john woo , on a fairly lame movie called hard target . \n ( if you can find a bootleg copy , woo's radically different director's cut is much better than what was eventually released . ) \nthis follow-up is directed by ringo lam ( city on fire , full contact ) , whose hong kong films are distinguished action pictures that have consistently played second fiddle to woo's more operatic offerings . \nthe surprise here is that maximum risk is a more effective hollywood action flick than either hard target or woo's subsequent broken arrow . \nhere's the rundown . \nvan damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who is shaken when a policeman friend ( jean-hugues anglade ) finds a corpse that's alain's exact double . \nturns out alain was separated at birth from his twin brother , michael , who has been killed by some russian heavies ( and some strangely american looking cops ) . \nalain does some investigating . \nhe finds that michael had booked a flight to new york city , and received a message from someone there named alex bohemia . \nassuming michael's identity , alain flies to new york and gets tangled up with michael's girlfriend ( natasha henstridge ) , the fbi , and the russian mob in little odessa . \nthat's as much as you need to know . \nthe story is adequate , but not overly involving -- and the major plot points are basically explained to you twice , just in case you go out for popcorn at the wrong moment . \nthere's a love story , too , but i didn't find it terribly convincing , partly because ex-model henstridge is too high-strung in her high-profile debut ( she had precious few lines as the alien ice queen in species ) . \nshe's great to look at , and she can certainly read a line , but what she does here can't really be described as \" acting . \" \nof course , \" acting \" isn't really what she was hired for ( i lost track of whether her shirt comes off more often than van damme's ) . \nthe movie is exceptionally violent , bordering on gratuity . \n ( keep that in mind when planning your date . ) \nthe stunts are spectacular , and the fact that you can spot van damme's stand-in makes his work no less impressive . \nthere's only so much you can do with a car wreck , but this movie makes crisp , effective use of pile-ups in a handful of frenzied destruction derbies . \nand lam has a surprising , innovative sense of exactly where the camera should go to catch any bit of action . \nthe main difference between lam and woo , i believe , is that while woo relies on sheer spectacle to gas up his action show pieces , lam has figured out more about using cinematic space and double-barreled points of view to make things run . \ndon't get me wrong -- when chow yun-fat soars through space pumping bullets out of two pistols and chewing on a toothpick with glass and confetti littering the air around him in woo's hard-boiled , it's an amazing moment . \nbut it's a moment that's hard to reproduce in hollywood . \n ( for one thing , hollywood doesn't yet have chow yun-fat ! ) \nwhile woo's hollywood movies look like the work of a talented upstart , maximum risk is a surprisingly confident picture . \nthe very first shot of the film is an awkward overhead view of a chase through the streets of a european city , but lam's use of odd camera angles becomes more efficient later on . \nthe film editing is a particularly savvy complement to lam's shooting style , accentuating rather than amplifying the action . \nthe performances could have used some fine tuning ( in particular , there's an annoying , overwritten manhattan cab driver in the early scenes who should have been toned down or jettisoned completely ) , and the movie doesn't always overcome the limitations of its genre . \nthe story is a little mundane , although there are some effective moments involving van damme's unrequited feelings toward the brother he never knew he had . \nbut it's not often that hollywood cranks out a truly satisfying action picture , and it's doubly surprising that this one should come with a mere whisper of publicity . \nvan damme fans should treat themselves to what may well be the man's best movie , and international action buffs will no doubt savor this flavorful hong kong/hollywood hybrid . \n", "in many ways , \" twotg \" does for tough-guy movies what la confidential did for police stories . \nthere's savviness in its writing and a mature patience in allowing the material to unfold . \nbut , i suppose , we wouldn't expect less from christopher mcquarrie , who was responsible for giving us \" the usual suspects \" . \nhis writing talents are still in tact as he brings to us a bloody yet intellectual tale of two unabashed but dimwitted thugs and a plan gone awry . \nthe two goons are parker and longbaugh ( ryan phillipe and benicio del toro ) . \nthese two men show the hardened wear of those who have always had it tough . \ntheir troubled youths have forged two nihilistic souls who use their amazing gunplay skills to survive . \ngiven the choice of minimum wage or petty crime , they'll always choose the latter . \nyet , they are incredibly foolish planners . \nactually , these two never really have a plan . \nthey just improvise along the way , hoping that their bravado and arsenal of guns will take care of anything that they might have overlooked . \ntheir next scheme , which they cook up about as fast as a mcdonald's burger , is to kidnap some surrogate mother named robin ( juliette lewis ) that was hired by some well-to-do family . \nif all goes well , they'll receive a nice bit of ransom money and life goes on . \nwhat parker and longbaugh do not realize is that robin is carrying a baby for the chidduck family , whose patriarch is a feared crime boss . \nmoreover , two bodyguards ( nicky katt and taye diggs ) constantly escort her . \nthese two protectors find an eerie sense of pleasure when being confronted and tested in life and death situations . \nthey would rather die than fail ; thus their bravado level is equally high . \nbut it seems that the testosterone levels of parker and longbaugh are a bit higher , and they employ some unusual but fun-to-watch tactics to pull off the kidnapping and to outrun the pursuers in a sort of slow-motion car chase down a series of alleyways . \nthe next hour or so , we watch the chidduck camp regroup and assess their situation . \nduring this time , additional plot lines come into play and more and more details are revealed . \nbecause the chidduck's can not go to the police and because of the special circumstances involving the kidnapping , we are introduced to more characters that will help to influence the outcome . \nwe discover that not everyone in the chidduck camp is loyal to the cause . \nas a result , there are undercurrents of a conspiracy , and elements of betrayal and subterfuge . \nthe sepia-toned atmosphere is made all the more fascinating thanks to a terrific soundtrack which emits velvet forebodings , shrills of intrigue and crescendos that tell us of life and death situations that are about to occur . \nthe momentum and the coolness of the film , however , begins to fizzle in the last 30 minutes , which featured an overly extended shootout where our two desperados try to make their way off with the ransom money . \nyou can expect lots of bloodletting and an odd denouement . \nin fact , you may admire this film more than you like it . \nyet , for the most part , \" the way of the gun \" stays on target . \nit feels cool with its elements of conspiracy and gunplay , and smart for its invective dialogue and tough guy poetry . \n", "marie ( charlotte rampling , \" aberdeen \" ) and jean ( bruno cremet , \" sorcerer \" ) are a comfortable , sixty-ish married couple looking forward to a peaceful vacation at their second home in lit et mix . \non their first , full day , marie sunbathes as jean goes for a swim . \nhours later , marie's initiated a full scale search when jean hasn't returned , but no trace of him is found . \nmarie returns to paris and resumes her life , including chats with jean at the end of each day in francois ozon's \" under the sand . \" \nmarie's ex-pat british friend amanda ( alexandra stewart , \" frantic \" ) and her french husband gerard ( pierre vernier ) try to snap marie out of her denial with a dinner party , where they introduce her to the handsome vincent ( jacques nolot , \" nenette et boni \" ) , yet marie suggests that gerard accompany her and jean to their gym the next morning . \neventually marie does begin dating vincent , but she discusses him with jean and even smiles at jean , hidden behind a bedroom curtain , when she makes love to vincent . \nslowly , though , reality continues to chip away at marie's fantasy life . \nher bank advises her that without access to jean's account , she needs to reduce her spending . \none of her university students ( she's reading virginia woolf's \" the waves \" ) turns out to be one of the young men who participated in the beach search . \nthen police arrive asking her to identify the clothing of a body they've found washed up from the ocean . \nthat night , jean's not at home when she returns to their apartment . \nher mother-in-law ( andree tainsy ) cruelly \ninsists that jean simply abandoned her out of boredom . \nfinally , marie goes to the police , insisting on viewing the body . \nhorrified ( she's been warned it was \nin an advanced state of putrefaction ) , she laughs when handed a bagged watch , insisting that this is not her husband . \n \" under the sand \" is a character study and melancholy portrait of aging ( 'i've lost my youth , ' marie declares ) and loss . \ncharlotte rampling , given the chance to portray an older , yet still sexual , woman runs with it , bringing us into the mind of the character . \nher chemistry with bruno cremet is startlingly natural . \nas marie returns from her first date with vincent , she sits on the couch with jean . \n'did he kiss you ? ' he asks . \nthe mood the two create is incredibly intimate and sad . \nozon ( \" water drops on burning rocks , \" \" see the sea \" ) , who cowrote the script with emmanuelle bernheim , marcia romano , and marina de van , has turned in a more mature work than his previous , creepy \" see the sea . \" \nwhile he cleverly never lets us see jean enter the water that fateful day , leaving a number of possibilities - accident ? , suicide ? , escape ? \n- open , he definitely tips his hand towards a certain outcome . \ncinematography by antoine hiberli and jeanne lapoirie ( \" water drops on burning rocks \" ) glides around marie ( their 180 shot as she initially searches the ocean's horizon for a sign of jean conveys her panic ) or captures rampling's exotic face in mood divining closeup . \nin an inventive fantasy scene , marie imagines jean's hands massaging her feet while in a state of auto-arousal . \nhis two hands become four , then more combined with her own , becoming almost a one person orgy and recalling roman polanski's \" repulsion . \" \noriginal music by philippe rombi quietly adds to the overall melancholy . \n \" under the sand \" is a unique portrait of loss . \nit would make an fascinating double bill with liv ullmann's \" faithless \" from earlier this year , another character study of a woman facing loss for different reasons . \n", "is it just me , or have disney films gradually lost their appeal ? \ni was almost stunned by the quality of \" who framed roger rabbit ? \" , a fun , unique look at a world where cartoons and people lived together . \n \" the little mermaid \" harkened back to , and perhaps surpassed , the classic disney animations from the first half of the century . \nhowever , the endless stream of \" the little mermaid \" wanna-be's is getting to me . \nyou know the spiel : a lame plot recycled from some well-known story , colorful , almost psychedelic animation , the lead character who learns a valuable moral lesson , the comedic sidekick/sidekicks , the seemingly unattainable love interest , a few catchy songs , a few in-jokes for adults , and the occasional out of place warner-brothers-coyote-fall-off-the-cliff type joke . \nit's a formula , and like any formula , it gets tiresome . \nthat's why i'm delighted to hear that disney recently picked up the international distribution rights to the works of ghibli , a japanese cartoon studio . \nfrom what i've seen of their movies ( \" kiki's delivery service \" and the already english-dubbed and american- distributed \" my neighbor totoro \" ) , foreign audiences are in for a treat . \nthese movies , particularly \" kiki's delivery service , \" are wonderfully original and entertaining . \n \" kiki's delivery service \" starts with an unusual premise : kiki , upon hearing forecasts of clear skies , decides it is time for her to leave home . \nthis is unusual because kiki isn't a college student or a young adult making her start on the world , but a thirteen year old girl eager to begin her training as a witch . \nher mother is also a witch , and as thirteen is the obligatory age for such training , her parents treat her leaving understandingly and put up only token resistance . \njust the idea of a witch heroine may scare away some audiences , but no mention is made of the occult , and the subject is dealt with harmlessly throughout the movie : kiki's mother acts as a village doctor , and kiki is able to do no more than fly on a broom . \nkiki must choose a city to move to , and what she chooses is the co-star of the movie : a german seaport town , far removed from the country life she has been used to . \ninitially lost in the impersonal hugeness of her surrounding , she's discouraged , and unable to support herself though her rudimentary skills as a witch . \non the verge of leaving for a new town , she uses her power of flight to deliver a pacifier to a baby who dropped it . \nthe favor eventually blossoms into her working as a courier , a one-persons delivery service . \nthis is where the movie becomes shockingly good . \nkiki's job is a catalyst for her realizing the beauty of the city and the world around her . \nthe townspeople she is put in contact possess an inner worth that doesn't seem forced or artificial , but merely derived from looking at ordinary people in a different light . \nthey're three- dimensional , impossible to quickly evaluate , possessing of faults , and understandably reserving in kindness towards a strange girl . \nhowever , each one has something about them , some interest or trait , that makes them interesting and unique . \nthe personal beauty of the citizens is complimented by the beauty of the surroundings : the seaport town genuinely looks impressive , capturing the european charm of a medieval city adapted to the more modern needs of the 1950's . \nthis beauty is beauty with depth ; for every detail left in , dozens are only hinted at . \ni could probably go on all day , but i won't ; suffice it to say that many of these minor details could have been the highlight of the movie . \nsome of my favorites are kiki's relationship with the baker's husband : although he's quiet , never shown speaking to kiki throughout the movie , and he initially scares her , his kindness wins her friendship . \nin the garage of a deliveree's house can be found a vintage model t . two old ladies have a relationship evolving from master-servant to friend-friend . \nsuch details gives the impression that the beauty shown in the movie is only the tip of the iceberg . \nadded on top of this is a lesson on the importance of self-worth . \nkiki initially seems to derive much of her self-worth from the beauty of her surroundings and the people around her , but an encounter with a rude girl crashes down her bewonderment , making her question the importance of such beauty . \nthis causes kiki to lose faith in herself . \nhowever , kiki comes to realize not only the beauty of her surroundings , but the innate beauty inside her . \nseeing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous , and the principal device used to do it is so sublime that i don't even want to hint at it . \nthe ending of the movie has a subtle charm combined with a sense of awe and , ironically , the most disney-esque moment i've ever seen ; if you don't hold your breath in wonder you might want to get medical attention . \nthe movie steers free of many of the disney conventions : there is no violence , however cartoonish , no song-and-dance number , and kiki's pet cat jiji is more a friend than a comedic sidekick , although jiji is given many funny lines and scenes . \nhowever , i would be surprised if disney doesn't give jiji more jokes , or at least the voice of some comedian . \nrefreshingly enough , the moral lesson of the movie is not self-contradicted , a habit disney movies have gotten into . \n \" beauty and the beast \" 's beautiful belle , for instance , learned that beauty was derived from a person's inside , and was then rewarded by having the beast turn into a handsome prince in snazzy clothing . \nkiki , on the other hand , learns to separate her wardrobe from her self-image , and nothing more is made of her early desires for better clothing than illustrating her increased maturity at the end of the film . \nanother difference with disney movies is in the style of animation for \" kiki's delivery service \" : not as colorful and dynamic as disney animation can be , but with a greater attention to realism and detail , it fits the movie to a t . this is particularly true with scenes of kiki's flights . \nthe extreme realism of the birds in flight near kiki is magnificent to behold , and helps these scenes capture the wonder of flight better than any other film i've ever seen . \ni'm not sure when or how this movie will be released in the united states . \ndisney tentatively plans a theater release of \" monoko hime \" shortly following the summer '97 japanese release , and should start releasing the other ghibli films after that . \ni'd guess that some will be released on video and some will be theatrically released in peak seasons with no competing disney release . \nalthough the wait is unfortunate , it's good to know that it's being released at all , for \" kiki's delivery service \" is definitely a movie worthy of widespread promotion and release . \nwatch this movie . \nalong with \" man bites dog , \" and perhaps something by woody allen , this is the best movie i've ever seen . \n", "insane ( but inspired ) musical about alferd packer , the first man ever tried for cannibalism in america . \nas the story unfolds we learn what events led to packer ( trey parker ) supposedly killing and eating the five men who got lost while accompanying him through the mountains of colorado in search of gold . \nthroughout , packer must contend with evil trappers bent on stealing his prized horse , a tribe of `ute' indians that doesn't seem quite on the mark , and a terrible winter storm that leads to the eventual cannibalism . \nparker obviously knows his musicals very well , because the viewer is also treated to some of the most maddeningly catchy songs to appear in a film ( he would accomplish this again in his post-cannibal ! \nmusical motion picture , south park : bigger , longer , and uncut ) . \napart from the inherent interest of seeing a pre- \" south park \" parker and stone in their first effort , cannibal ! \nalso offers up some pretty decent laughs . \nthe aforementioned `ute' indian tribe that packer's group encounters is a definite highlight , as are two rousing musical numbers about snowmen ( one of which ends on a comedically deadly note ) . \nstone's humphrey character steals the show , especially when complaining about the prospect of having to `eat butt' or revealing what's underneath his muff cap . \njason mchugh's character of mr . miller is the stand out performance though , as he offers a hilarious dissenting voice to the proceedings . \nas i mentioned before , parker's songs are very catchy . \nyou'll be hard pressed to get `it's a shpadoinkle day' out of your head once you've heard it ( incidentally , the braniff logo that appears at the end of every \" south park \" episode is scored with a few notes from this song ) . \nother songs you'll find yourself humming include `when i was on top of you' ( a love ballad ) , `the trapper's song' ( the villains leit motif ) , and `hang the bastard' ( the rousing finale ) . \nthankfully , none of these songs are quite as embarrassing to find yourself singing in public as south park : bigger , longer & uncut's songs are . \nreleased as a pick-up through troma studios , the film is available on videocassette and dvd . \nthe videocassette includes an intro by the beautiful jane jensen and an interview segment with lloyd kaufman , discussing his admiration for parker and stone and the fact that they had been hired for a zucker brothers film ( which turned out to be the hilarious baseketball ) . \nthere are also multiple trailers for upcoming troma films . \nas for the dvd . . . \nwell , that's a different story . \nprobably one of the best dvd packages of the year ( and potentially of all time ) , cannibal ! \nthe musical ! \nthe dvd is a massive achievement . \npresented in 1 . 33 : 1 ( full frame ) only , the disc has the usual troma inclusions : the tour of troma , the troma intelligence test 2 , trailers for upcoming releases , but where the disc truly shines is in its cannibal ! \nspecific extras . \nthe first thing i must note is , the transfer is about as beautiful as any i've ever seen on any disc . \nthe picture is crisp , clear , and free from any noticeable artifacts . \nadd to that one of the funniest commentary tracks i have ever heard , featuring trey parker , matt stone , jason mchugh , dian bachar , and andy kemler getting drunker and drunker as the track continues and you still haven't scratched the surface of the extras . \nthere's also behind the scenes footage of the shooting of the film , a clip with trey , matt , and lemmy ( of the band motorhead ) from the film terror firmer , an index for easy location of all of the songs in the film , and finally , an index of all the songs as performed by the cast of a stage production of cannibal ! . \nit's good to see this film finally get the treatment it deserves . \nkudos to the entire production staff at troma and aix for making one of the most entertaining dvds i have seen in a very long time . \n", "allen , star of many a brian depalma movie in the early eighties , has a brief , throwaway part towards the end of \" out of sight , \" as the maid of a crooked financier . \nin keeping with her past performances

falling for one another . \nthe mutual attraction continues as the couple on opposite sides of the law slip in and out of one another's grasp . \nkaren follows jack to detroit , where he's about to pull off another heist , this time a cache of uncut diamonds from incarcerated businessman richard ripley ( played by a toupee-sporting albert brooks , almost unrecognizable in the prison scenes ) . \nit's during this final caper-gone-awry that allen makes her scant appearance . \nclooney's range as an actor is limited , but he has undeniable charm . \nlopez , too , is easy on the eyes , but she demonstrates more depth in her portrayal of karen , a tough yet tender professional . \nshe dispenses with hit men as easily as she out-maneuvers sleazy pick-up artists in a bar . \nespecially cute is a sequence in which karen fantasizes about jack in a motel bathtub . \nadmirably supporting clooney and lopez are don cheadle as fellow felon maurice 'snoopy' miller , steve zahn as the perennially stoned glenn michaels , and dennis farina as karen's dad , who affectionately buys her a piece . \nadd a couple of uncredited cameos from \" jackie brown \" cast members and \" out of sight \" proves to be a lot of fun . \nnot as hip and clever as \" shorty , \" perhaps , or as complex and colorful as \" brown , \" but loads of fun nonetheless . \n", "synopsis : in phantom menace the galaxy is divided into power groups whose interests will inevitably collide in later sequels . \nthere is an overarching galactic united nations-type organization called the senate presided by a weak chancellor . \nwithin the senate two camps are at odds : a bickering , isolationist alliance called the republic and their aggressive rival the trade federation . \npreserving law and order are a council of jedi knights who are meanwhile searching for a prophesied chosen one of virgin birth . \nmanipulating events behind the scenes is a dangerous , reemerging clan called the dark lords of sith , so shadowy and secretive that they comprise a \" phantom \" menace . \njedi knight qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) witness an invasion of teenage queen amidala's home planet naboo and befriend a gungan named jar jar ( ahmed best ) . \non the desert planet of tatooine the two jedi , jar jar , and amidala ( natalie portman ) attend a lengthy drag race involving the young boy anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) . \nthe five protagonists try to solicit help for freeing naboo by visiting the city planet of coruscant where a lot of debate and political maneuvering takes place . \ncan they free amidala's helpless planet ? \nopinion : on tv last night i watched young , wannabe celebs pay $400 a ticket and come running out of theaters to bask in front of news cameras , gushing with testimonials of the phantom menace's greatness in exchange for a few seconds of being on national television . \ngiven this kind of media mania i wondered if phantom menace , the most anticipated movie of 1999 , could possibly live up to the extraordinary hype that preceded it . \ndoes phantom menace match the exaggerated hype ? \ndirector george lucas answers , \" it's only a movie . \" \nto me , any movie with russian-sounding accents for bad guys , jamaican accents for good guys , and middle eastern-sounding accents for seedy gamblers accents can be expected to be more tongue in cheek than profound . \nvisually , star wars : episode i --the phantom menace ( 1999 ) is a kid show where parents can take their young ones to marvel at child-friendly cgi characters and wondrous backdrops even if the character dialogue ( mostly geopolitics ) is beyond the level of children . \nit is left to parents to patiently explain the conversation : droid origins , family lineage , the definitions of terms like blockade , appeasement , federation , alliance , symbiosis , satellite-controlled robots et cetera . \nat least this much is clear : there's plenty of eye candy , and in the last few minutes it's good guys and joe camel lookalikes versus a caped , horned red devil character and his mechanical hordes . \nweaknesses : weaknesses lie in the writing and in the performance . \nat first it seems like the film is to be an invasion story , but then phantom takes an hour-long detour to cover one chariot race before returning to the invasion theme . \nthis dilutes the central story . \nadditionally , smaller scenes seem written self consciously , as if they were added more to fill us in on extraneous background information for other movies rather than form an integral part of the present movie . \nveteran actors liam neeson and ewan mcgregor noticeably outperform the other acting leads . \nbetter ensemble chemistry between the five leads and background information that is central to a tight story line could have made have given phantom stronger performances and storytelling punch . \nstrengths : on the bright side phantom menace as a big-budget production is far ahead of the competition in terms of making whimsical creatures , worlds and vehicles appear real . \nthe film boasts sophisticated , top-of-the-line visuals and quality exotic costumes , a musical score entertaining enough to stand alone , and three worthwhile sequences in the second half . \nbottom line ? \nseeing the film is entertaining and informative , like a visual theme park with star wars filler information serving as dialogue between impressive money shots . \nwe are bound to be completely inundated by star wars publicity , music and tie-ins for the next few months . \n", "at one point during brian de palma's crime epic scarface , the radiant michelle pfeiffer turns to a ranting al pacino and pops a question that the audience has no doubt been wanting to ask for themselves : \" can't you stop saying 'fuck' all the time ? \" \nfucking good question , that . \nit may not be an honour that instills the filmmakers with pride , but as far as i can tell oliver stone's script contains the said expletitive more times than any other film in cinema history . \nyet it would be a shame if bad language is all de palma's scarface is remembered for , because this is a damn fine gangstar flick . \nthe overall structure is similar to howard hawks' 1932 original , but this time the scene has switched to miami , florida and our anti-hero's chosen vice is cocaine traffiking . \npacino , sporting a thick cuban accent , gives one the best performances of his career ( golden globe nominated ) as tony montana , a cuban refugee with a criminal past who flees castro and comes to america to live the american dream . \nand live it out he does , with lashings of violence , abuse , murder and the funny white powder . \nfrom his earliest jobs as a drug runner for various middlemen , tony montana makes it clear to everyone he meets that he's not a man to be fucked ( sorry ) . \nsoon he's the king of the cocaine heap , but his hot head and an increasingly out of control drug addiction prove his undoing . \n \" never do your own stash \" , warns one character early in the film . \nas sure as night follows day , the emperor of miami eventually falls . \nwriter oliver stone and director brian de palma make an explosive combination here . \nstone's script offers solid storytelling and some fine character development . \nmontana is fascinating ; uneducated but calculating , a straight shooter who speaks from the heart ; an ambitious , violent man yet one with a conscience . \na man fiercely protective of his beautiful 20 year old sister , not wanting her to be sucked into the glitzy , dangerous world which he inhabits . \npacino is dynamite , taking to the role with a brooding , bristling energy which in his more recent films has often degenerated into just simple overracting . \npfeiffer also registers strongly as the gangstar mole with no inner life . \nonly once does tony express real affection for her and his desire to have children , and even then you sense all he really wants is a regular screw and a beautiful object to show off to his friends , and she's happy to oblige . \nthis isn't as meaty a role for pfieffer as sharon stone's was in casino , but its an effective one nonetheless and she aquits herself well . \nas director , de palma sets up a number of dramatic scenes with his typical stylistic brauva . \nthe escalating tension he creates in various mob situations - a drug deal gone wrong , an assination attempt - is often thrilling , and in this respect he is every bit the equal of scorese and coppola . \nwhere he differs from , say , coppola's godfather trilogy is in his overall treatment . \ncoppola gives his crime sagas an operatic sweep , whereas in scarface de palma opts for a grittier feel . \nand it perfectly suits the material . \nthe only major botch is giorgio moroder's mostly crap synthesier score . \nit's just not right , and unfortunately compromises the impact of some otherwise good scenes . \nas expected , scarface is very violent at times , but you shouldn't be watching gangster movies if that upsets you . \nat over two and a half hours in length it's a true epic , and if you're a fan of the genre you'll love f * * k-filled minute of it . \n", "for any groom on the verge of proposing marriage to his girlfriend , there are certain rules that he needs to follow . \nfirstly , fill her life with happiness and romance during the courtship . \nsecondly , buy her a beautiful ring that glitters as brightly as her eyes . \nthirdly , find the perfect moment and location to propose . \nfinally , the groom-wannabe should probably get her parent's blessing . \nof these four , the last one can be a nightmare . \nmeeting parents is a rite of passage , fraught with unexpected questions , bouts of nervousness , the reality of being disliked , and the inability to make a positive impression . \nif you're lucky , things will go smoothly . \nbut , if you're greg focker ( ben stiller ) , everything will go wrong . \nand with a name like that , how could it not ? \nwhen greg first meets his fianc ? e's father , jack byrnes ( the grimacing robert deniro ) , greg immediately feels overwhelmed and is put on the defensive . \nwhen he tells jack that he's a male nurse , the incorrigible dad shoots back , \" not many men in your profession , huh , greg ? \" \nit's definitely not a good start . \nbut greg is determined to win him over , and it's this desire that fuels the movie . \nhe first takes small steps such as agreeing to say grace before dinner . \nit doesn't matter that he's jewish . \nif daddy byrnes asks him to say grace , then that's what he's going to gamely do . \n \" oh god . . . you're \nsuch a good god \" , he moons . \nhis discomfort at trying to force out a simple prayer will make you chuckle , but when jack gives him the \" deniro squint \" ( that familiar , unsettling gaze that gives deniro that aura of invincibility ) , it's pretty hard not to grin . \nthings get progressively worse for greg . \nand that's too bad because he's a genuinely likable guy with a romantic heart . \neventually , he begins to try so hard that he starts to mess everything up , committing a host of gaffes that embarrass , humiliate or injure other people . \nit's a never-ending ordeal of missteps , miscues , and mistakes . \nhe buys some champagne , but uncorking the bottle leads to disastrous circumstances . \nhe tries to find jack's missing cat . \nbut his method of solving the problem leads only to more trouble . \nand there are several other episodes , each one trumping the next in outrageousness . \nthe more our well-meaning beau screwed up , the more the audience groaned in sympathy . \nwe liked greg . \nand , we liked this movie . \n \" meet the parents \" is a farcical comedy that certainly has its moments . \njust sit back and watch greg get into trouble . \nno matter what the situation , whether its playing a harmless game of water volleyball or sneaking a smoke on the roof of the house , things will horribly go wrong . \nwe laugh at greg's expense , but love often makes a person do dumb things , and ben stiller has the knack of playing the romantic fool . \ndeniro is also affable , tough on the outside yet sentimental on the inside . \ntheir tug-of-war is often funny , the slapstick is elaborate , and there are several topical throwaway gags ( mostly targeted at the airline industry ) to make this film an amusing yet smart lampoon about future in-laws from hell . \n", "i like movies with albert brooks , and i really like movies directed and written by albert brooks . \nlost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies . \nhis humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies today , inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator . \nyou will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film , while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent \" talk films \" which are finding their way into theaters . \nthe situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with , but even if we can't , brooks has the talent to make them comfortable , and therefore we laugh . \nteenagers and jim carrey fans probably won't find an albert brooks movie very funny , but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will . \nput simply , brooks' comedy is intelligent . \nmother is albert brooks' latest film , and it does not disappoint . \nbrooks plays john henderson , a middle-aged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce . \nhe makes an attempt at dating , but fails miserably . \nhe then has dinner with his brother jeff ( rob morrow ) , a successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life . \njeff has a good job , a loving family , and most of all , a warm relationship with their mother beatrice ( debbie reynolds ) . \nafter dinner , john witnesses a telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice , and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunky-dory the dialog is . \nin comparison , beatrice always hints at a fault in john and his career every time she talks with him , and john gives it right back to her . \nat the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart john's life , she says , \" i love you , \" and john replies with , \" i know you think you do . \" \nthe thing is , beatrice is not overt with her criticisms , but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit-picking and guilt loading . \nit's the kind that goes something like , \" yes , dear , i think you do that wonderfully , but . . . . \" \nit seems as though nothing he does makes her happy . \nthere's always the big but . \njohn believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women , either because of his flawed self-esteem caused by his need for validation , or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner . \nhe comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home , he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out , and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is . \n \" a great experiment \" , he calls it . \nbrooks' own brand of humor really shines in this film , especially in the interaction john has with his mother . \nthere's a scene where john has just arrived at his mother's house , and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito , and having explained to his mother about the \" great experiment \" , beatrice asks , \" now explain to me again why you don't want to stay at a hotel . \" \nshe still doesn't get it , and it is absolutely hilarious . \nin the same scene , we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh . \nshe apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over . \nwhen john points out the ice on the sherbet , beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze . \n \" you've named the ice ? \" \nasks john . \nhe's also surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator , such as a twenty-pound block of cheese . \n \" the freezer was a good invention , \" says john , \" but it's not supposed to be used for everything . \nthat's why it's smaller than the refrigerator . \" \nit's something most of us find strangely familiar . \nbrooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur . \nfor example , in defending your life , his and meryl streep's characters are in a comedy club having a discussion . \nwhen they're finished and walk out , brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line , \" and so the moral is , if you have to fart , go outside ! \" \nyou don't know what the joke was because you couldn't hear him during the entire scene , but i must have laughed for the next five minutes , it seemed so out of context . \nin this film , brooks uses the same trick a couple of times to open or close a scene . \ni don't want to give them away , but suffice it to say they work just as well as they have in the past . \njohn's purpose for staying with his mother is to learn , and we as the audience learn right along with him . \nhis mother is not the fascinating type to begin with , but as john spends more time with her , we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth . \nwatching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way . \non screen , brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character : you get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world . \nin a way , he's very much like yosarian of catch-22 , expect with something of an attitude . \ncasting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect . \nshe assumes the part with ease , even moving and speaking a little slowly , and is just so adorable it's hard to get mad at her character . \nthis only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing with her . \nas his first choice , brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice , but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband , who was beginning to show symptoms of alzheimer's disease . \nthat may be just as well , since reynolds lends a softness to the character which enhances it immensely . \nrob morrow also does a good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mother's favorite and , for all his success in his job and family , is slowly exposed as a mama's boy . \nthe only things that hold this movie back from being better are a couple of plot holes . \na solid connection is not really made between john's troubles and his reasons for living with his mother . \nadditionally , the end results of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goals , and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting , how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this ? : \nbeatrice : you must think i'm some kind of moron . \njohn : no , i think your someone who thinks i'm a moron . \nbeatrice : well , it takes one to know one . \n", " ( note : there are spoilers regarding the film's climax ; the election , of course ) \nwe see matthew broderick , a man torn to a primal state ; he's been unfaithful to his wife , lied to and manipulated his students , and by the same token they've demeaned his masculinity , his self-respect , his desperate attempt at changing the world . \nand yet , he equates the cause of his pain , his torment , with tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) . \nno matter how many students have come and gone , and disappointed him as an educator , she's the real threat . \nabout to give in , and divulge that she's won by only a lone vote , broderick's mccalister turns in defeat , sees tracy's euphoric celebration in the outside corridor and says , 'no' . \nthe fact that he simultaneously lusts after her ideologically further illustrates that freudian foundation of entitlement which all men , no matter how obscure , have in their relationships ; a traditional expectation of success , to usurp and surpass women as a proverbial industry . \nshe can't go higher than him . \nhe won't allow it . \nand what's amazing about \" election \" is that every word of that criticism is drawn from a rather opaque metaphor . \nearly in the film we learn that tracy was romantically , and then sexually , involved with a now departed teacher . \nit's like payne and taylor , his co-screenwriter , have taken tracy , a girl desperate for friendship , loyalty , and almost perversely drawn the mythological pattern of kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers , that they found sitting at the teachers' lunch table more fitting , to an unlikely extreme with her as the protagonist . \nand it's amazing the compassion that we have ; it seems so real to us , and not merely because it's happened before , splashed all over the front pages , but , because of the all around \" nice \" persona of these people , we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters . \nit's with mandy barnett's \" if you'll be the teacher \" playing winsomely over the closing credits that payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most ; a final , viscous injection of bittersweet irony . \nsexuality , though , is not the only basis for payne's satire , or its success . \nit also makes a telling point about politics , friendship , and class boundaries . \nsatire is required ( or ought to be , anyway ) to take itself seriously , or act so , while the audience does not . \nit's a fine line to straddle , but some films ignore it altogether ( \" drop dead gorgeous \" leaps infuriatingly to mind ) . \npayne and taylor hit the right chord ; their characters are real people : neither is perfect , but rather both of the leads are flawed , misguided individuals who retain , somewhat , noble intentions at heart . \nwe sympathize with them , but still , as a satire , their idiosyncratic behavior , and their wrongdoing , is taken to an extreme for the audience to knowingly chuckle , but also reflect and meditate , about . \nminus half a point , though , for payne admitting not to having seen \" ferris bueller's day off \" . \nwhatever . \n", "martin scorsese's films used to intimidate me . \nbecause of his reputation , i felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great flicks . \nas much as i enjoyed them , i usually felt like i missed something . \ni learned from scorsese's casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story . \nno mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies . \nfor example , in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words with each other . \nthere was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what was really going on . \nor toward the end , when he uses three quick dissolves to compress a scene of a car backing away from a building . \nagain , the simple , mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing . \ni don't mean to say that his techniques are not creative or good-looking . \nbut he simply uses the best tool for the job . \nit shouldn't have surprised me , then , that kundun , a film about a mystical religion , actually turned out to be quite straightforward . \nthe movie follows the life of the 14th dalai lama , the spiritual and political leader of tibet . \nthe movie's title is another name for the dalai lama which means \" ocean of wisdom . \" \nhis story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic visions to embellish the literal story . \n ( one of which makes an interesting statement : pay attention to the film's opening shot and watch where it is repeated . ) \nwe first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old . \nhis curiosity and self-assuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama . \na test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the 13 dalai lamas who have gone before . \nseveral items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items . \nthe child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own . \nthe boy picks correctly , proving that he is the new , and the old , dalai lama . \nscorsese and long-time editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk . \nbefore selecting an item , he would look at the monk , perhaps for some sort of confirmation . \nsometimes he picked right the first time , and sometimes he made a second choice . \neither way , whether through reincarnation or quick human perception , the tibetans were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise , perceptive leader . \n>from this point on , the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lama's spirit and the future leader of a nation . \nit is a great weight to put on the mind of a child . \nin the u . s . it might be grounds for a call to social services . \nbut the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage . \nneither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming a genuinely likeable , well-rounded person . \ncertain patterns take shape over the years . \nfor example , the dalai lama is fascinated by technology . \nradios , clocks , and telescopes are some of his favorite toys . \nwhen he is old enough to accept his leadership , he makes plans to modernize isolated tibet . \nhe also has a soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain , including herd animals . \nit's nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter . \nbut the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibet's gigantic neighbor , china . \ntibet and its leaders prove correct in fearing china , as , first the propaganda , then the political pressure , and finally the armies , come across their common border . \nthe chinese invasion is so successful that the lama's life is in danger if he stays . \nthe movie ends when , after much agonizing , the dalai lama leaves tibet for india . \nthe story doesn't lead up to a cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films do . \nit just doesn't fit that mold . \nif it were forced into such a shape it would have been a completely different movie ( perhaps more like seven years in tibet , which is good in its own right ) . \nthe pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that . \nthe structure of the film is made to fit the characters and events , not vice-versa . \nperhaps because the pace is slower , we have more time to notice the beautiful art , vestments , and architecture of tibet . \na mandala , ( tibetan sand painting ) with beautiful , vibrant colors is shown throughout the movie . \nthe robes and hats of state are bright red and gold . \nthe bricks are a rich reddish brown , not unlike the skin tone of the tibetans . \neven the touchstone pictures logo before the movie ( which is usually light blue ) is the red and gold of tibet . \nphilip glass composed the music for kundun , and he was the perfect choice . \nfor those who don't know of glass , his music is like a tibetan mandala . \nhis building blocks are lots of small notes , tiny grains of music , which are first grouped , then repeated in patterns . \nthese patterns create interesting textures which are themselves part of a larger composition . \npeople won't be flocking to kundun for it's great ending , or talking about its outstanding plot , but it does have a lot to offer : an interesting lifetime , exotic sights , rich cinematography , and innovative music . \nit gives interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and takes a warm look at the dalai lama as a person . \non top of it all is the cinematic mastery of martin scorsese , who gives the film a strong , beautiful , consistent look . \n", "robert redford's a river runs through it is not a film i watch often . \nit is a masterpiece -- one of the better films of recent years . \nuntil 1994 , it was my second favorite film of all time . \nthe acting and direction is top-notch -- never sappy , always touching . \na friend of mine once reported that he avoided it because \" i was afraid it would just be really politically correct , and tick me off . \" \nall i could do was tell him to go in unbiased , and enjoy . \nit is one of the few movies that has completely reduced me to tears . \nbut certain memories should not often be rereleased -- in the last few shots , you have to cry . \nupon my first viewing i left bawling . \nit is not flawless -- but it is so very good , that you can't help but be effected . \nthe opening is dangerously nolstalgic and sentimental -- watching these shots of people who have been dead so long , gives you a feeling of perspective and history observation that you will find in very few other films . \nmartin scorsese once described the movies as a dream state -- like taking dope , and immersing yourself in an alternative world . \nthat is what a river runs through it does . \nit exploits the unique power of cinema to engross you and help to forget your real self . \nboth times i've seen it , its been hard ( again to quote scorsese ) waking up . \nbut the dream is lovely . \n", "richard gere is not one of my favorite actors . \nhowever , i like courtroom dramas , and this film looked good enough to take a chance on . \ni wasn't disappointed . \nit wasn't a great film , but it was interesting , and took several unexpected turns . \none thing : what's with the title ? \nnot only is it extremely forgettable , it doesn't really have much to do with the film , as far as i could determine . \nin the long run , it will probably hurt the film , as people won't be able to think of or remember it . \nmartin vail ( richard gere ) is a grandiose defense attorney . \nhe loves the money and the fame that go along with defending ( successfully ) rich scum , such as mafia men and drug-dealers . \nonce he sees that the accused killer of a prominent chicago archbishop is a baby-faced alter boy , he wants in on the case , presumably for the press he'll get . \nwe soon find out that the prosecutor assigned is a former lover , janet venable ( laura linney ) . \nvail himself is a former prosecutor , and quit because of tensions between himself and the district attorney , played very well by john mahoney ( frasier's father on the tv series ) . \nthere is an underlying theme of dichotomy in the movie : people have public faces , and private faces . \nwe see this in the murdered archbishop , in the accused , and , most strongly , defense attorney martin vail . \nrichard gere does a fairly good job . \nat first , he appears to be a money- and attention-grabbing lawyer , with no consideration of the truth . \nbut we see another side , as he becomes a seeker of justice , and comes to believe in his client . \nalfre woodard , as the judge , is capable , though somewhat wasted in a standard role . \nlaura linney also does journeyman work ; nothing spectacular , but acceptable . \nher relationship with vail is believable ; their verbal fencing adds to the film . \nthe actor who playes vail's investigator ( unfortunately , i don't remember his name ) is quite good . \nhis female assistant ( she looked very familiar , but i can't remember where i've seen her ) was also capable , but unspectacular . \nthe best performance in the film was by edward norton . \nhe was excellent , as the timid altar-boy turned alleged \" butcher boy of st . mike's \" . \ni was impressed by the depth of the plot ; there are red-herrings , and dead-ends , that in a lesser film would lead to a predictable ending . \ni liked the plot twists the film took , and most of the supporting characters , thus i give primal fear a respectable b+ rating . \n", " \" when you get out of jail , you can kill him . \" \nstarring ashley judd , tommy lee jones , bruce greenwood . \nrated r . \ndouble jeopardy is a lurid , prepostrous thriller that's also one of the year's most enjoyable . \nit's an uncompromisingly brutal , cheerfully anarchic , hyperactive actioner that has a mission and never diverts from it . \nthere is not a moment here when the events on screen don't have a direct bearing on the plot ; once the film gets going it never stops . \nit has been branded as the female version of the fugitive and that's probably a correct assessment of the plot , but the film itself has little in common with the 1993 andrew davis/harrison ford collaboration besides the presence of star tommy lee jones . \nnot even bothering with character introduction , director bruce beresford floors the gas pedal from the get-go and never finds the brake . \nwe meet , rather hastily , libby and nick parsons ( ashley judd and bruce greenwood , respectively ) a seemingly happy married couple , with a son matty , age 4 . they go out on a sailboat one night , and after a period of some rockin' sex , they go to sleep . \nlibby hears a strange

moment , the coast guard shows up and libby is arrested . \nher lawyer , a friend , puts up a defense in court , but though we know she is innocent , the evidence against her is too compelling . \nher friend adopts her son and she goes to prison . \nonce in prison , she makes a phone call to her friend . \nher friend gives her son the phone . \nnick walks in the room . \nlittle matty screams \"

state already convicted her of killing her husband , they can't convict her of the same crime again , meaning that when she gets paroled she can kill him and they can't touch her . \nafter a weirdly short amount of time , she gets out of parole . \nshe is sent to live at a house with other recent parolees , under the command of parole officer travis lehman ( tommy lee jones ) . \nshe sets out on a mission to find her husband and get her son back , which turns out to be much more difficult than anticipated . \nshe winds up tracking him all the way to new orleans where she finds out that he has long killed his girlfriend and her son's \" adopter \" . \ndouble jeopardy is based on an assumption that is legally false . \nthe law stating that nobody can be convicted twice for the same crime assumes that it is the same crime : same time , same place , same circumstances . \nit's not like it matters . \nthis is a rollickingly good thriller ; intense , exciting , fast and furious . \nit's silly alright , but this is the kind of film you just don't question . \nin some films , plausibility is everything . \ndouble jeopardy , however , is not concerned with making sense : its sole purpose is to entertain , and it does . \njudd helps the film tremendously in a difficult role . \nthis is her breakout box-office performance , and she is terrific . \nshe brings some emotion to what could have been a one-dimensional role , giving the movie a little soul to go along with its effective chase scenes and action set pieces . \ntommy lee jones basically just reprises the role for which he won an oscar in the fugitive , but the movie makes good use of his stone-faced wit . \nthankfully , too , double jeopardy refrains from developing a romance between libby and travis ; a subplot which doubtlessly would have interfered with the film's story . \nthis is one of those movies where cops are the bad guys , and i took a sort of sick pleasure in that . \nthe sheer anarchy of the proceedings was nothing short of wonderful , as ashley judd kicks the crap out of every authority figure in the book . \nafter all the idealistic hollywood features featuring hero cops , deft fbi agents and the virtues of the american legal system , it's great to see a movie that doesn't so much demonstrate their fallacy as it delights in their failure . \ndouble jeopardy is really good , but it isn't the kind of good that is remembered or recognized with awards . \nit's one of those movies better viewed with the brain turned off , otherwise , your brain will be busy ruining your experience . \nthis is a thriller that isn't concerned with being smart or plausible . \ninstead it diverts all attention to the action , which , this year , is second to none . \n", "let's say you live at the end of an airport runway . \nlarge jetliners continuously pass over your house , rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace . \nlet's say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances , and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home . \nnow let's say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway , and offers you more than it's worth . \nwouldn't you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed ? \nof course you would . \nbut what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise , and the house your castle ? \nthat's what they are to darryl kerrigan ( michael caton ) , and although he's happy that a multi-national corporation would like to buy his home , sorry , it's not for sale . \nunfortunately , the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government , which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice . \nnot about to take this lying down , darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto ( tiriel mora ) and makes a determined , albeit pathetic , attempt to fight back . \nthe castle , an australian comedy by rob sitch , is perhaps one of the simplest movies i've seen in recent memory , yet also one of the funniest . \nin fact , it is this film's reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful . \nthe good guys and the bad guys are clear , the humor is straightforward , and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets . \nit's the perfect setup for a relaxing , hilarious good time , and as much as i hate to admit it , i liked the fact that i didn't have to think all that much while watching this film . \ni just sat back and enjoyed myself . \nthe situation is one we've seen before : regular joe fights back against the government , or big business , or whatever . \nwhat makes this film different is its characters . \ndarryl thinks he's got the best life in the world - he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind , he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when he's got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal ( anne tenny ) , and he swells with pride when his son dale ( stephen curry ) digs a hole in the yard . \nsteve kerrigan ( anthony simcoe ) constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for \" investments \" like jousting sticks and overhead projectors , while wayne kerrigan is in jail , as a result of dennis denuto's incompetent courtroom maneuvers . \nthe great thing about the kerrigans is that they aren't so stupid that they get annoying . \nthey're just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing . \nwe look upon them with a little bit of pity , but a whole lot of affection . \nscreenwriters sitch , santo cilauro , tom gleisner , and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate , further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans . \nsympathy for their situation , the laughter they bring us , and the family's wonderful characterization , simple as it may be , leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them . \ni suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans , but trust me , it works . \ni particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs . \ndon't get me wrong - slapstick , when executed well , can be genius . \nit's just that too often , a film will resort to it's use as a shortcut to amusing the audience , not always successfully . \ninstead , the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed to the rest of the world . \nwhen they are by themselves , the are funny , and when they are with normal people , they are hilarious . \none of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though . \nthe kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the film's running time . \nluckily , it's a funny little detour that , while slightly distracting from the film's main drive , is still quite enjoyable . \nwith all the levity abound in the castle , the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept , that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property , an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes . \ni'm not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life , but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution ( of australia ) and certainly sounds impressive at any rate . \nand , for that matter , it's more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this . \n", "in this good natured , pleasent and easy going comedy , bill murray ( ghostbusters , 1984 ) plays grumpy weatherman phil conners , who , every year , is sent to punxsutawney , p . a , to report on groundhog day . \nthe groundhog day ceremony involves a groundhog being lifted out of a box , and if he dosen't see a shadow , it will be an early spring . \nphil really hates the ceremony , and not even his producer rita ( macdowell ) can change his mind . \nhowever , fate has a cruel trick for phil , and he starts re-living groundhog day over , and over , and over , until he gradually likes it , and rita falls in love with him . \ngroundhog day is a well written , totatly unoffensive and funny comedy . \nthe screenwriters , director ramis and danny rubin , have written a funny , warm , but never overly senitmental comedy . \nalthough the idea of a day repeating over and over may sound tedious , there are enough good jokes to hold the audiences attention throughout the whole film . \nramis's direction also helps , and although he dosen't try any flash director tricks , the film is directed well enough , and the jokes are set up well . \nand the editing is also good , especially when it shows one part of the day over , and over again , such as when phil tries to have the perfect night with rita . \nthe performances are also excellent . \nbill murray is great fun , and his transistion from cynical to happy is smooth , and delivers his lines in his usual smary style . \nandie macdowell is good as rita , although sometimes she is just a little bit too sweet in some parts of the film . \nthere is chemistry between the two leads , thankfully , otherwise the whole film would probably fall part . \nchris elliot , as the cameraman larry , is also funny , although you have to like his goofy style , otherwise you are really going to hate him throughout this film , and it will lower your enjoyment of the film overall . \nthe supporting cast aren't bad either , with stephen tobolowsky hillarous as phils old school mate ned ryanson , and even director ramis popping up as a neurologist . \nin fact , there is not one dud performance in this film , and even the groundhog gets a funny scene involving a car chase . \noverall , there is really nothing wrong with groundhog day at all . \nit almost seems perfect . \nhowever , the film can get a bit soppy sometimes , and some people may get irritated by the day repeating over , and over , and over , and over . \nalso , there's not much of an music score , and the music there is is pretty bad . \nbut these criticisms hardly affect the audiences enjoyment at all . \noverall , then , groundhog day is a funny , smart , and also has some room in there for some heart . \nan excellent comedy . \noverall rating= ( \n", " \" no man is an island , \" one character quotes john donne in apt pupil , effectively summarizing the movie's themes . \nwhile hardly a great film , singer's ambitious adaptation of king's short story * is challenging nonetheless ; perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement psychological thriller is that a major studio got behind it . \napt pupil is a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses . \n1984 . wonder-bred high school honours student todd bowden ( renfro ) conducts his own extracurricular investigation of kurt dussander , a nazi war criminal who fearfully fled berlin in the 1960s and was never heard from again . \nbowden suspects arthur denker ( mckellan ) , the lonely german senior citizen who lives nearby , is actually a pseudonymous dussander-much research and dusting for fingerprints proves young todd's theory . \nbowden strikes a deal with dussander : in exchange for not revealing his identity , dussander must satisfy bowden's intense curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust from the nazi point of view . \nthe stories he hears keep todd up at night and haunt his daydreams , but like a bystander at a traffic accident , todd's desire for gory details overrides his repulsion . \nbowden revives in dussander feelings dormant since the end of wwii . \nmarching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for dussander : it leads to his torture of a cat and the torment of his \" student \" , among other things . \nbowden , who has taken on very hateful qualities ( he kills birds and doodles swastikas on his notebook ) , engages the veteran in an endless game of one-upmanship . \ndussander stands to lose his freedom , and bowden his credibility-in effect , his post-secondary school future . \nall of this winds down to a fairly unpredictable ( and unsettling ) conclusion , one which requires leaps of faith from its audience yet is more satisfying than the source material's excessive climax . \nsinger has yet to get keyser s ? ze out of his system . \nhis the usual suspects and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as innocence ( verbal's tics and todd's golden-boy reputation are plausible ruses ) ; they showcase morally bankrupt anti-heroes to whom telling the truth is not an option if they are to achieve their goals . \napt pupil is a richer film than the usual suspects , a movie famous and popular partly because its plot machinations were not germane to the outcome-there was no way you could see the ending coming , as it was all a hoodwink , anyway . \nthankfully , singer has gotten most of the usual suspects' film-schoolish geek theatrics out of his system . \nsome scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected and/or obvious ( the dream sequences were extraneous ) , but the majority of the film is subdued-and singer's handling of the violent scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer and a murderer-in-training . \nmckellan's and renfro's performances contribute enormously to the overall success of the film ; while most people will focus on british stage vet mckellan's finely-tuned realization , i'd like to single out renfro's daring work . \nhe isn't afraid to play someone largely unappealing and cold-hearted ; he strips his character of vanity , something many of his peers wouldn't do . \n ( can you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylor-thomas in the same role ? ) \nrenfro was recently charged with possession of cocaine-i hope he doesn't continue down that path , because he has a big future in good movies waiting for him . \nas guidance counsellor edward french , \" friend \" schwimmer also deserves mention . \nhe wants to be the parent to todd that todd's own well-to-do folks are not ( todd , like most modern kids-and only-children-has mom and dad wrapped around his pinky finger ) , and his sincerity makes the apt pupil's blackening-heart even more apparent . \nbut one of the film's ultimate questions , are we born evil or do we learn evil ? , might be answered in french , whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous . \nno man is an island , indeed-we all have the capacity to make the \" right \" or the \" wrong \" choices . \nschwimmer winningly plays one of a trio of fascinating characters who make the unconventional apt pupil laudible . \n-october , 1998 \n * the excellent collection king's stories called different seasons spawned not only apt pupil , but the shawshank redemption ( originally titled rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption ) and stand by me ( originally titled the body ) . \n", "i rented this movie with very high hopes . \nthis movie got praise as one of the best films of 1998 , and unfortunately , was not as good as i hoped , but was still very intriguing and thought provoking . \nfirst of all , the casting for this film is great . \ntobey maguire and reese witherspoon are the future of hollywood . \nthey play their roles as the parker brother and sister perfectly . \nwith a plot as unbelievable as this film , you need chemistry and honest acting from your cast . \ntobey and reese ( bud and mary sue parker ) play their roles perfectly and display their characters with honesty and believability . \nwilliam h . macy , an actor i have grown to love over the past year , turns in another great performance as the tv dad who is torn over his wife , a \" colored \" person and his friends , the \" non-colored \" ones . \nhe also displays believability and must display a certain lack of chemistry with his wife . \nhe does this perfectly and yet again shows why he should be one of the top actors in hollywood . \njoan allen is equally great as betty parker , the ideal tv mom . \nher character is the most ambitious . \nshe is very na ? ve , and must display this well to make her character believable and she does just that . \nher lack of chemistry with macy , which the role calls for , and her developed chemistry with jeff daniels is terrific , and if daniels would have been as stellar as the rest of the cast , then this film would even been even better . \nas said before , jeff daniels gives a bad performance . \nhis character displays the change going on throughout the town , yet he does not display it with enough conviction . \nhis character is very confusing and he is not very believable . \nthis film could have been elevated to a whole new level had daniels been able to give a better performance . \nthe movie is very provocative . \nit challenges the issues of racism that existed in the past and that still exist today . \ni really was not expecting all of the elements they brought up , but they pulled them off with such flair that it was mind blowing . \nthey demonstrate the racism issue without a hitch , but do it in a slow pace . \nthe only major flaw in the film besides the performance by daniels is length . \nsome films are not meant to be that long . \npleasantville is one of those films . \nthis film could have been so much better had they not moved so slowly to it . \nfirst , they are amazed by the implementation of color . \nthen they want to have it . \nthen they do not want to . \nthen the war ensues between the colored and non-colored . \nthis is all strung out over two hours , which was way too long . \nsome movies need a lot of time . \nsaving private ryan was a little bit under three hours long and i thought it could have used more time . \nthis film is only two hours long , and seems much longer . \nlength is everything in films . \nif you can nail down the perfect timing and pace , you can win half the battle . \npleasantville can move at a good pace at times , but it is not consistent enough . \noverall , pleasantville is a very pleasant and provocative departure from the predictability of most films these days . \ni went in expecting a light-hearted film about change . \ni left learning an important lesson about racism and the way things change . \nluckily , pleasantville teaches this lesson in such a way to make it appeal to all audiences . \nonly if it could have done in a shorter amount of time . \n", "few films in 1999 have divided the critical consensus as sharply as alan parker's adaptation of frank mccourt's memoir angela's ashes . \nmany dismissed it as an humorless , sentimentalized , uninteresting version of the hugely popular novel ; others hailed it as a heartfelt , sincere portrait of the human spirit . \ni'm somewhere in between , leaning strongly towards the latter . \nit's certainly well-made and it never becomes tedious like some literary adaptations have a tendency to be . \nbut i have a feeling that parker filled the movie with pseudo-lyrical shots of rain falling on the homely streets of ireland just so it can have the two-and-a-half hour running time that screams \" i'm important ! \" \nmccourt's book of the same name was about him and his family moving from the us to ireland in the early 1900's , a time when most people were desperately trying to get into the us . \nas he comments , \" we were the only irishfolk to say goodbye to the statue of liberty . \" \nin ireland , frank ( played by joe breen as a small child ) , his 3 brothers , his mother angela ( emily watson ) and his father malachy ( robert carlyle ) get financial help from angela's mother , a stereotypically strict catholic who chides her daughter for marrying a northern irishman . \nshe helps them get a rat-infested apartment and malachy goes looking for a job . \npositions are scarce and when he does finally find one , he is unable to hold on to it because of his fondness for drinking . \nmeanwhile , frank goes to an uptight catholic school , where the instructors beat students with blunt wooden objects as often as their heart desires . \ntwo of frank's brothers soon die , crippled by the dreadful living conditions and malnutrition . \nas if the poverty and the suffering weren't intense enough as it stood , malachy and angela have another baby , worsening the situation further . \ni imagine this doesn't sound like much of a plot . \nthat's probably because it isn't one . \nthese are people . \nthis is their story . \ndirector alan parker ( the commitments ) knows how to tell a good story and angela's ashes , despite its relentlessly literary tone remains interesting . \nthough the film occasionally indulges too much in its gloomily picturesque irish setting , it avoids looking like a glorified travelogue . \nsupplementing parker's able direction are the engaging , often poignant performances of the leads , some of them seasoned thespians , others relative beginners . \ncarlyle , the charismatic british actor who has shown astonishing range by hopping from the lead in a rowdy slapstick comedy to the villain in a james bond movie and now to sentimental melodrama , perfectly portrays his rather pathetic character . \nwe empathize with the guy , but we don't like or admire him . \nemily watson turns in a heartfelt , sincere supporting performance . \nit is mostly she who implants that lump in our throats . \nalso worthy of mention is little joe breen , whose face graces the film's superb poster . \nit is breen's first feature film and he's extraordinary as young frank . \nnot unlike sudden oscar darling haley joel osment of the sixth sense , you can peer into the character's soul through breen's sad eyes . \non the flip side , one thing that could have vastly improved angela's ashes is a more decisive editor . \nwhile gerry hambling sure makes the most of the scenery , he and parker also leave in at least a half an hour of unnecessary footage . \nthe first half , especially , could have been trimmed down , bringing the film to a more reasonable running time and doing our bladders a favor in the process . \nthings pick up at about the halfway point , sort of dismissing a lot of the criticisms i accumulated during the opening hour , but i maintain that the aggressively deliberate pace parker and co . set in the first half was ludicrously unnecessary . \n * spoiler warning ! \nskip next paragraph if in suspense ! * \nthe film's final message is somewhat conflicted , as frankie , in effect , leaves his family famished in ireland while he himself goes back to america . \nwhat , exactly , are we supposed to make of that ? \nhis mother doesn't seem to mind because she wants the best possible future for her son , as any mother would , but it still seems inconsiderate of him . \ni haven't read the book , but i'm sure that mccourt justifies his actions therein ; therefore , i'm suspicious . \nanother thing that's never made clear in the movie is the meaning of the title , which , i'm sure , is also explained in the memoir . \nif seen as a film onto itself , rather than an adaptation , angela's ashes stands tall . \ndespite a few minor setbacks , it is a captivating story of people forced to live in the trenches by an merciless society where those of weaker character are shoved to the bottom of the financial ladder . \n", "now that \" boogie nights \" has made disco respectable again ( well , fashionable at least ) , we shouldn't be surprised to see more films glorifying that dubious era . \nthe latest art house interpretation is whit stillman's \" the last days of disco . \" \nstillman , who made \" metropolitan \" and \" barcelona \" using some of the same actors , uses disco's final hours to highlight what is another conversation-heavy movie that benefits from typically astute writing from the director . \nthe young , upwardly-mobile professional ( don't call them yuppies ! ) \nmen and women of \" the last days of disco \" frequent a prestigious new york city nightclub pulsating to the bass-pounding rhythms of earth wind and fire , amy grant , and andrea true connection . \nhere they talk and talk and talk , intellectualizing about such things as dating , success , and being liked , accepted , and admired . \nif talk is cheap , \" the last days of disco \" must surely have been an extremely inexpensive movie to shoot . \nwhat makes the film so entertaining is that this preppie , harvard-educated jet set actually have something to say and say it with wit , perception , and style ( including , at one point , a riotously inventive deconstruction of \" the lady and the tramp \" ) . \nna ? ve alice ( chlo ? sevigny ) and sophisticated charlotte ( kate beckinsale ) are recent college graduates who work as assistant editors for a new york publishing house . \ncharlotte is confident and outspoken--perhaps a little too outspoken ; alice is shy and introverted , \" like a kindergarten teacher . \" \nthe two friends often doll themselves up and head out to the nameless nightspot , looking good and looking for excitement ( and that ms . beckinsale sure looks good on a dancefloor ! ) . \nhere they meet , or re-meet , a variety of eligible men , many of whom they knew in college . \ndes ( played by stillman favorite christopher eigeman ) is one of the club's managers whose job is on the line for sneaking his ad agency buddies in the back . \ndes has reached a crisis point in his life : he just found out--last wednesday , in fact--that he's gay . \nwhether it's true or not , it makes for a convenient excuse to dump his latest girlfriend ( jennifer beals in a small but soul-baring turn ) . \ncharlotte observes cattily that the only gay thing about des is his mouth . \njimmy ( mackenzie astin ) is the advertising exec who , by the end of the picture , winds up heading for a new job opportunity in spain ( visions of \" barcelona \" ? ) . \njosh ( matt keeslar ) is an assistant district attorney who dreams of being able to say , just once , \" book this clown ! \" \nand robert sean leonard plays another one of alice's revolving suitors ; the two have an amusing exchange about the true definition of virginity . \nany film that can make robert sean leonard palatable is worthy of respect in my book . \nin fact , the entire ensemble is appealing in that well-spoken stillman way . \nwhile the eschewing of \" ferocious pairing \" is a favored topic of conversation in the film , the protagonists tend to slip in and out of love , lust , and trouble with each other in an emotional merry-go-round that cleverly develops its characters through the \" preferred \" dynamics of social group interaction . \nmore mature than stillman's previous two films , \" the last days of disco \" is as consistently droll as it is stimulating . \nit's a movie you should definitely get on down to . \n", "this has been an extraordinary year for australian films . \n \" shine \" has just scooped the pool at the australian film institute awards , picking up best film , best actor , best director etc . to that we can add the gritty \" life \" ( the anguish , courage and friendship of a group of male prisoners in the hiv-positive section of a jail ) and \" love and other catastrophes \" ( a low budget gem about straight and gay love on and near a

\nthe local priest - an aboriginal , but in the \" white fellas \" church - has a foot on either side of the line . \nhe is , figuratively and literally , in both camps . \nernie dingo brings a great deal of understanding to this role as the man in the middle . \nhe is part churchman and part politician . \nhowever the tension , like the heat , flies and dust , is always there . \nwhilst her

and therefore flawed . \nbrown comments that he expects audiences to feel warmth towards the man , then suddenly feel angry about him . \nit wasn't long ago that i visited central australia - ayers rock ( uluru ) and alice springs - for the first time . \nthe wide-screen cinematography shows the dead heart of australia in a way that captures it's vicious beauty , but never deteriorates into a moving slide show , in which the gorgeous background dominates those pesky actors in the foreground . \nthe cultural clash has provided the thesis for many a film ; from the western to the birdcage . \nat least three excellent australian films have covered the aboriginal people and the line between them and we anglo-saxon 'invaders' : \" jedda \" , \" the chant of jimmie blacksmith \" and \" the last wave \" . \nin a year when the race 'debate' has reared up in australia , it is nourishing to see such an intelligent , non-judgemental film as \" dead heart \" . \nthe aboriginal priest best

me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie . \nthe producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable . \nyou have to reach for a larger audience . \ntherefore , the movie is quite user-friendly . \naltough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange . \nbut fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on . \nyou will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera . \nin any case , the answer is no . \ni am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium . \nhowever , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie's opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie . \ni taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new . \neverything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others . \ni know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie . \nwarning : major spoilers follow ! \nplease do not read to fully enjoy this movie , you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird \" hummm \" sound is all about . \nyou have been warned . \nthe x-files is what a summer should be . \nexciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances . \nthis is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank . \nfrom start to finish , this movie does not let go of you . \nwhen i compare it with last summer's movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon . \nthis flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes . \nin fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue . \nyou might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd ! \nthe last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid . \nyou know , when you are affraid to put your feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ? \nso yeah , the x-files is scary . \nand guess what ? \nyou never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster . \ndo not think that the x-files is a monster movie . \nin fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total . \nno , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series . \nscully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time . \nshe has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much . \nno , this is mulder's time in the spotlight . \nby now , you have heard of the scene where mulder \" showers \" independence day . \nif you have not then i will not spoil it for you , let's just say that due to recent events mulder should be \" showering \" godzilla instead . \nto those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there . . . who \ncares ! ? \nif he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ? \nthe dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous . \nthe camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill . \nthe script is spotless , every thing that happens happens for a purpose . \nif you are confused by something , do not worry because it will all become clear later on but , and i cannot stress this enough , pay attention ! ! ! \nunlike most summer movies , the dialogue is twice as important as the effects . \nmiss one vital piece of information and , like most people who talk during movies , you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense . \nalso , to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies . . . don't ! \nthe person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation . \nthere is no time to take a breather between scenes because , again unlike most summer movies ( godzilla anybody ? \n ) the x-files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots , every scene is crucial and serves a purpose . \nwho needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a \" big emotional scene \" between godzilla attacks ? \nso far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i'd recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose . \nbut the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie , the x-files is . \nwhat more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited ? \ncool effects ? \nit's got some . \npulse pounding ? \nhell yes ! \nstrangely enough , i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non-fans will have a good time . \nit does not provide answers to the show's many questions , the status quo remains nearly the same and , no , mulder and scully do not get together . \nrating : four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer , several jump right out of your seat thrills , many \" whoah , i never saw that one coming ! \" \nmoments , four \" holy shit , where the hell did that come from \" and one heck of an ending . \nyou may wonder where this movie lost half a star . \nwell , i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck , the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop . \nit's pretty obvious the film's makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time , but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving . \n", "trees lounge is the directoral debut from one of my favorite actors , steve buscemi . \nhe gave memorable performences in in the soup , fargo , and reservoir dogs . \nnow he tries his hand at writing , directing and acting all in the same flick . \nthe movie starts out awfully slow with tommy ( buscemi ) hanging around a local bar the \" trees lounge \" and him pestering his brother . \nit's obvious he a loser . \nbut as he says \" it's better i'm a loser and know i am , then being a loser and not thinking i am . \" \nwell put . \nthe story starts to take off when his uncle dies , and tommy , not having a job , decides to drive an ice cream truck . \nwell , the movie starts to pick up with him finding a love interest in a 17 year old girl named debbie ( chloe sevigny ) and . . . \ni liked this movie alot even though it did not reach my expectation . \nafter you've seen him in fargo and reservoir dogs , you know he is capable of a better performence . \ni think his brother , michael , did an excellent job for his debut performence . \nmr . buscemi is off to a good career as a director ! \n", "i wish i could say that there is something more to the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials , but there isn't . \ngeorge lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant , special effects-bound flicks and he has done it again . \nthis is the first star wars film i've seen on the big screen , so , of course , the impact was much greater than when i watched the three original episodes on video . \nwhat is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story , but its amazing visuals . \nbasically , the film's plot is centered around trade disputes between two planets . \nqui-gon ( liam neeson ) and his young apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) set out with the animated jar-jar binks to fix the mess that may result in war . \nwhen their ship breaks down and they are stranded , they find a young boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his slave mother . \nqui-gon strongly believes that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately takes him under his wing . \nanakin participates in a heart-pounding podrace , one of the highlights of the film , to get the equipment needed to fix qui-gon's ship . \nhowever , most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy . \nmeanwhile , queen amadala ( natalie portman ) is frustrated and at wit's end , being na ? ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders . \nthere are hardly any emotional scenes in the film- even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training , the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb . \nthis does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made . \nin all the star wars films , human emotions that we , the audience , can identify with are usually nil , but the films are for pure enjoyment , not for uplifting purposes . \ndespite the fun of watching the movie , the phantom menace is not without flaws . \nfor starters , we have the ill-conceived , moronic character jar-jar binks who should be considered a threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience . \nwhat a klutz ! \ngeorge lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character that would be as memorable as , say , yoda , r2-d2 , or c3-po , but , alas , his efforts were in vain . \nsecondly ( this may be good or bad , depending on your point of view ) , the movie's atmosphere is so different from the familiar comic-book feel of the previous three star wars installments . \nthis is due , perhaps , to the utter complexity to this movie's plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here . \nthe movie seems to be reaching for epic proportions . \ni can't say much about the acting , though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway . \nhowever , there is absolutely no pizzazz to the performances- they are straightforward and , at times , stale . \nnatalie portman has a great presence , but her turn as queen amadala makes the queen a stoic , unfeeling ? enigma . \nthere is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance . \njake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk . \ndespite the inevitable faults , there is so much to enjoy about the movie . \nthe heightened excitement of the final sequences doesn't quite surpass the famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes , but they are amazing and edge-of-your-seat fun in their own rite . \nthe film is a treasure to look at . \nthe visual effects are astonishing 99 . 8% of the time- the awe-inspiring , mouth-opening , eye-popping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effects genius . \nnot since 1997's the fifth element has there been a film as drenched in visual treats as this one . \nthe production design is reminiscent of the fifth element , the previous star wars movies , kubrick's 2001 , maybe even of fritz lang's classic silent metropolis . \nhowever , all the sets are so original . \nthe original star wars movies can't even match the grandeur of this film's visuals and that is a sheer pleasure for the viewer- it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode . \nthe costumes are remarkable and have jean-paul gaultier written all over them . \nwhether its queen amadala's gigantic wardrobe complete with gold-embroidery and feathers , or the jedis' simple brown uniforms , the costume designer has fused talent with outrageousness . \nthe costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie . \nas for john williams' score , i don't think he's done one as complex or powerful since ? i can't even remember . \nit is as epic as his schindler's list score and as thrilling and zestful as jaws . \nit includes the bare bones of his music from the previous three films , but williams has added on , made the music much more intense and moving . \nwhat with the overwhelming hoopla that circled this movie , one might come in with high expectations and be disappointed . \nthere is very little to hate in the film : it's a very accomplished and skillfully made flick . \nit is the best \" fun \" film and the best big-budget film out today , most definitely . \n", "lisa cholodenko's \" high art , \" is an intelligent , quiet drama . \nits strongest quality , aside from the top-notch central performances , is the perceptive way in which the film , also written by cholodenko , observes its characters . \nthey are all flawed people , some more troubled than others , but they are not judged . \njudging the characters in this picture would be a creative misstep on the filmmakers' parts , because no one , no matter how bad off they are , deserve to be negatively judged if they are involved in some serious problems that they cannot break free of . \nsyd ( radha mitchell ) , a 24-year-old woman living with her longtime boyfriend james ( gabriel mann ) , has recently been awarded an ideal job at the high-profile photography magazine , \" frame . \" \nshe very much enjoys where her career is headed , but is often not taken very seriously by her managers , who are always giving her petty jobs to do , when she knows she could be doing more important things . \none night , while taking a bath , syd notices a leak coming from the apartment above hers , so when she goes up there to inform them of it , she meets lucy beliner ( ally sheedy ) , a thin , worn-out , and unhappy woman , who lives with her drug-addicted german girlfriend , greta ( patricia clarkson ) , a pathetic former actress who is usually so out-of-it that she often is in and out of conciousness . \nsyd quickly strikes up a conversation with lucy , and discovers that she used to be an acclaimed photographer ten years before . \nlucy claims she doesn't want to get back into the profession , but syd manages to convince the \" frame \" editors to do a piece on her work . \nall the while , syd begins to grow deep feelings for lucy , even though she has never previously been attracted to a woman , and lucy starts a battle with her personal demons . \n \" high art , \" is such an effective motion picture because it is never suger-coated or idealized , but instead an honest and convincing portrait of a handful of unhappy people whose lives are going nowhere , while syd's luck begins to rise . \nthe film in no way is about lesbianism , but about love , which was a refreshing change of pace from the usual stereotypical portraits of homosexuality . \nas lucy and syd grow closer and closer together , we really do believe that they are falling in love with each other , even if the relationship might be doomed . \nwith this picture , ally sheedy's star has risen once again , thanks to her touching , nearly flawless portrtayal of lucy , a woman who , in the course of a decade , has found her life consumed almost entirely by drugs , which has taken away her once-blossoming career . \nher characted really is tragic , and one particular scene involving lucy and her mother , in which lucy admits to her that she has a drug problem , and her mother matter-of-factly responds by saying she can't help her , is heartbreaking . \nalthough not autobiographical , sheedy has had drug problems in her past , and i suspect she brought that knowledge of already being in lucy's footsteps to her role . \nalso very good is radha mitchell as syd , who previously starred in the slight 1997 australian comedy , \" love and other catastrophes , \" wh caught me by surprise with her performance . \neasily being able to pass as christina ricci's older sister , mitchell obtains the same natural charisma that has made ricci so popular recently . \nas accurate as almost every detail is in , \" high art , \" i wish the relationship had been more tightly written involving syd and james , who , played by gabriel mann , is left with a throwaway role . \nby the time he finds out about syd and lucy , he disappears from the film , and i wish there had been another scene where they confronted each other . \nthis is a very minor fault , however , in a film that is full of riches . \nalthough many of the characters are stuck in a hopeless pit of despair , syd and lucy are intelligent people who recognize their problems . \nthe character of dominique ( anh duong ) , the \" frame \" editor who decides to give syd a chance with her ideas , was also written to be far more mature than expected . \nand the one sex scene in the film was beautifully and originally done . \nfor once , it did not invlove steaminess , or violent sexual activity , or gratuitous nudity , but focused on the actual characters , who love each other , and their insecurities involved in making the decision to actually have sex . \n \" high art , \" which won the screenwriting award at the 1998 sundance film festival , marks the superior feature film debut of cholodenko , as well as sheedy's strongest , and best , role to date . \n", "the relaxed dude rides a roller coaster \nthe big lebowski a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman \nthe most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider . \nwhen those observers are joel and ethan coen , the surreal becomes bizarre . \nwhen the life is that of jeff \" the dude \" leboswki , the bizarre falls over the edge into the world of \" what'sgoingonaroundhere \" . \nthe marvelous sound of \" the stranger \" ( sam elliot ) 's voice-over introduces the film . \nat least it does until he forgets what he was going to say and gives up . \nthe dude ( jeff bridges ) is described as the \" laziest man in los angeles , possibly the world \" , although he's not so much slothful as he is relaxed . \nspending the last 30 years with a roach clip in one hand and a white russian in the other , he doesn't have much of a life , but he's having a good time . \nwhen asked what he does for fun , he responds \" bowl , drive around and the occasional acid flashback \" . \nlebowski's passion is bowling . \nwhen he's not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike , things just happen to him . \narriving home one night , he's beaten by thugs attempting to collect money that his wife owes them . \neven worse , they urinate on his rug . \nthe problem is that the dude doesn't have a wife . \nhis assailants realize that their target is a different lebowski when they glance around at his apartment . \nthe \" big \" lebowski ( david huddleston ) is a multi-millionaire and his dudeness lives in two-room squalor . \nthe next day , our ragtag hero visits his namesake's mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug . \nthe carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together : not surprisingly since it's virtually the only object there . \nwhen he's denied any money , he picks up a replacement rug off the floor . \non his way out , he runs into lebowski's trophy babe wife bunny ( tara reid ) who offers to perform a sexual act that , according to rumor , is one of bill clinton's favorites for a thousand bucks . \nthe penniless dude wisecracks that he's heading for the cash machine . \nlater he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being the bag man to deliver a ransom to bunny's kidnappers . \nthis begins the trademarked coen brothers crimes-gone-wrong sequences . \nthe kidnappers are impossibly inept . \nthe dude and his cronies are even worse . \nevery plan goes awry . \nyou can almost see lebowski's brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues . \nthat's the story , but to tell the truth it doesn't much matter . \nthere could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining . \nthe narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into . \nthe dude's bowling buddies walter ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) look like people you'd see on the street but , like everything else in this film , they're not quite what they seem . \nwalter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties . \neverything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam . \nwhen a fellow bowler crosses the foul line but won't admit it , walter pulls a gun on him until he marks a zero on the score sheet . \ndonny gets precious few words in between walter's screaming and the dude's rambling . \nwhen he does , walter shouts him down with horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling puns . \ndonny is \" out of his league \" and doesn't \" have a frame of reference \" . \nthe film is peppered with people for whom the term \" character \" would be an understatement . \nthe big lebowski's daughter maude , an avant-garde \" vaginal \" artist , paints while swinging naked in a leather apparatus like an s&m mary martin . \nthe kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers . \nbunny lebowski is a high school cheerleader turned porno star . \nmost impressive is john turturro in his far too small role as a hispanic bowler . \nas the flamenco music swells , we see him putting on his lavender hose . \nthe camera pans up to an all-purple skin-tight bowling outfit with \" jesus \" ( pronounced with a \" j \" , not an \" h \" ) embroidered on the pocket . \nhe addresses the lane with intense seriousness and one painted fingernail . \nhis tongue slowly snakes out and lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball . \nbridges works the dude as if he had been living him for decades and maybe he has . \ni can't think of anyone else who could have done a better job . \nbuscemi has a limited role , but he plays it perfectly . \nthe more that i see john goodman the more convinced i am that he's one of the treasures of our time . \nit's odd to think that most of the world knows him only as roseanne barr's television husband . \nmore like the coen's \" raising arizona \" than their hit \" fargo \" , \" the big lebowski \" demands an open mind and even more open eyes . \na mark of the coen brothers is that even with all wonderful dream sequences and the broad slapstick physical comedy on the screen , much of the humor is subtle and easy to miss . \nthere's so much going on that frequently it disappears before you can see it . \nwalking out of the theater , i felt that the film had something important to say . \non further examination , i wasn't sure exactly what it was . \n \" if you meet jesus at the bowling alley , it's not going to be what you expect \" ? \n \" when the going gets weird , the weird go bowling \" ? \nmaybe there's no real message . \nperhaps it's just a roller coaster ride through a hilarious world . \nmaybe that's enough . \n ( michael redman has written this column for 23 years and just realized that he was so taken with the dude that he ran out of space to talk about \" the man in the iron mask \" starring that favorite of 14-year-old girls of all ages . \nredman@bvoice . com is the eaddress for estuff . ) \n", "i don't box with kid gloves . \ni don't play nice , i'm not a nice guy , and i never , ever , go easy on a film . \ni consider it to be a breech of some sort of code of ethics for a movie critic . \nhowever , i do some favors , and these often come in the form of points that i hand to certain groups due to the artistic bravery . \nrigormortis , the production company that has been my prime example of how money does not need to motivate filmmaking , gets several of these points each time . \ni still , however , will not go easy on them . \nthey recently sent me a vhs copy of their down with america trilogy ( which begins , quite wittily , with a disclaimer that they are not trying to undermine america with the making of this film . ) and i decided to spend an hour of my day watching it . \nin the famous lines of many martyrs , i have no regrets . \nwell , i do have some regrets , but that is not the point in the previous sentence . \nthe point of it was that down with america was a film that , from a critical standpoint , did not entirely disappoint me . \nsure , the risky use of vhs instead of super 8mm or 16mm was a pain , and the natural light was one of the most annoying things about public access films , but the movie itself was fairly enjoyable . \ndown with america concerns a government agent , needless murder , and a book containing everything from the unabomber's manifesto to the 1995 apple computer profit report . \nlike the previous films of rigormortis that i have reviewed , it displays an off-kilter humor and intelligence ? it succeeds in making me laugh where countless studio films fail . \nthe best way to see this film would be as a parody of the countless conspiracy films that we have been drowned in since the paranoia of the 80s . \na dying movement from the day they started , these paranoid `thrillers' had the government always covering up something and had the same favorite word : `roswell . ' \nin down with america , the line `roswell' is highly absent . \nwith an about ten minute running time , down with america effortlessly sidesteps every clich ? that the conspiracy films fell into , makes jokes at them at the same time , and provides us with funny and memorable characters . \nagain , i have seen movies that have gone on two hours with characters i couldn't care less about . \nthe film , as previously stated , concerns a federal agent ( peter roach ) , an obsessed librarian ( meri stevens ) , a mystery man ( joe kaczkowski ) , and two people obsessed with silence in the library ( robb sherman , kevin flowers ) . \nthe plot : a book containing the secrets of all anarchists is hidden in ? a public library where it can be viewed by all . \nfrom there we go into a delightful parody . \nthe federal agent claims his sovereign right to alter the truth , the librarian goes on a diatribe about the sanctity of books . \nwe spend our time laughing at fairly idiotic jokes that are performed much too well considering the lack of coaching of the cast . \nalthough the actors and actresses are in small roles and give a whole new meaning to `no-name' , it ends up being the no-name people who do a good job , delivering better performances as comic villains than half the crap that hollywood turns out . \nfor once , i don't have a url that i know offhand to give you as to where to locate the film online . \ni can only say that you should find my previous reviews of l'auto and les x-files and look up the rigormortis productions site in and of itself . \nit's almost as much fun as the film . \n", "here is a film that is so unexpected , so scary , and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop . \nokay , it isn't quite original , considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species , but it certainly is smart . \nmost films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b-horror films from the 50s and 60s , and some even become them . \nhowever , as we learned with the 1995 small-budget horror/sci-fi film , sometimes expectations can be shattered . \na lot of criticism has gone against this film ( from what i have read so far , anyway--yep , all two reviews ) , and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory , laughable pieces of trash . \nbut , the thing is , it isn't . \nit's well made , well acted , and quite intelligent . \ni can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film . \nbut the species series isn't about the lack of these elements . \nit's about how much it can get into one film . \nand yet , behind it all , it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so . \nspecies ii begins in the present day , though it seems to be an alternate universe . \nmany films ( especially sci-fi ones ) create similar timelines as our realistic one , but change it to fit the film's needs . \nspecies ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft , the excursion , landing on the surface of mars . \naboard is patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , a very bright and very handsome astronaut . \npatrick is the son of senator ross ( james cromwell ) , who just wants patrick to succeed . \nwell , it would seem that he has succeeded . \nlanding on the surface of mars , he is the first human being to ever do so . \nof course , he isn't the first ever . \nabout a billion years ago , an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life . \nnow , of course , the red planet is cold and rocky . \nno life lives on it . \nthat is , no visible life . \npatrick , upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil , collects samples from the ground . \nhe takes them aboard , and puts them in storage . \nunfortunately , one of the samples contains a form of life , and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship . \njust prior to heading back to earth , this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings . \nthey pass out for approximately seven minutes , and then shrug it off as nothing , because they can't even remember . \nthey blame it on a technical malfunction . \nback on earth , patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible . \nas we know from the original , this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet . \nhowever , the children that are bred are half-human , as their father is . \npatrick is really looking for another alien to breed with , and he finds it in eve ( natasha henstridge ) . \neve was cloned from dna taken from sil , the original alien . \nhowever , this time around , most of her \" alien \" urges have been either decreased dramatically , or lie dormant . \nthe project is led by dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , reprising her role from species ) , and her motives seem respectable . \nsince she was involved with the original alien attack , she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again . \nand it has . \nstory-wise , species ii is much stronger than its predecessor , but it is also much stronger than , say , aliens ( hey , i love the film , but you can't tell me it was strong on story ) . \nwhat surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay . \nin my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college , we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles . \nthis piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars ( later , it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it ) . \nthe script uses this effectively , but also manages to provide a well-balanced plot . \nbeginning with the first man on mars ( something i have always dreamed of seeing ) , i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie . \nand it does it quite well . \nthe characters are all smart , and they know what to do and what not to do . \nthe only character that seems a little cliched is the general ( george dzundza ) , and yet , he remains logical in everything he does . \nthere are the obvious flaws of course , mostly lying in the technical aspects . \nthe special effects are only mediocre , and some are just plain bad . \nbut for the most part , they remain believable ( i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children ) . \nalso , the most realistic ones are usually the goriest , ranging from people being torn open , or someone's head being blown off . \nhowever , some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience , including a menage a troi that is all but necessary . \nmany people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex , nudity , and gory violence . \nhowever , i tend to disagree . \nwhat were the alien films about ? \nand , if an alien species ever did come to earth , and their sole purpose was to destroy us , wouldn't you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible ? \nmy only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store . \ni didn't realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with ( i just assume it is his part-human side looking for the most beautiful one ) . \nthe acting is quite good for this kind of film . \nit is a vast improvement over the first film , at least . \nthe acting is the key element to this film : if it was bad , it would have lowered itself into camp ; if it was good , it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens . \nokay , so it isn't that good . \ngeorge dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting , as his over-the-top impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting . \nnatasha henstridge is limited this time around , as she is usually enclosed in a cage . \nhowever , she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent . \noh yeah , and she's quite fun to just plain watch . \nmarg helgenberger is immensely better this time around , and her performance is probably the best in this film . \nmichael madsen is so-so , but he isn't annoying , and he soon becomes rather appealing ( with his nice cynic personality ) . \njames cromwell has a small part , but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor . \nas i say , any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability . \nmykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance , and he gives the film a more down-to-earth feel . \nand , of course , justin lazard . \nlazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance , but i think he is effective . \nsure , he is wooden , but isn't that what his character is like ? \nthe moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done , due to the couple's acting . \nspecies ii is rated r for strong sexuality , sci-fi violence/gore and language . \nthis is definitely an r rated film that young kids should not see . \nmore than likely , they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives . \nhell , i don't even know if i will . \nwhat is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year . \ni probably won't see another film where i was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while . \ndirector peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful , and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series . \nmedak has also mastered the wonderful \" jump ! \" \nmoments , and has probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film ( scream still has the first ) . \nstrong acting , smart dialogue , intelligent plotting , and a sure-handed director , species ii is exactly what these films should be : entertaining . \n", "plot : this movie takes place over one day . \nit's a rookie cop's narcotics training alongside a seasoned police veteran . \nthe rookie doesn't know much about \" street justice \" , so the older cop teaches him about the way things work in the \" real world \" . \nhow even cops like themselves have to \" bend the rules \" and \" break the law \" every now and then , in order to catch the really bad guys . \ncritique : a pretty intense little movie with solid acting across the board , some ups , some downs and a thrilling ending , despite a couple of small flaws . \ni really enjoyed this movie because it followed two extreme characters and put them in situations which had me wondering about what i would do if i were in their place . \nthe film gets right into the \" dirty \" side of , well . . . the \ndirt on the streets , and proceeds to teach the rookie cop ( and us , the audience ) how things really work down there . \nof course , we're receiving this lesson from a man who has put away a lot of scum in his time , but the things he seems to be doing aren't exactly on the up-and-up either . \nand therein , lies the fun of the film . \ndo you agree that you yourself would need to break a few small laws in order to put away the people who break the really big ones ? \nwell , as the film moves along , we're given two points of view in respect to this predicament , and to me , both sides made sense at some point or another . \nand you gotta give a lot of credit to the screenplay for that , the director , who builds the film up wonderfully ( with the darkness of the day leading to the darkness in the script ) and the two actors who deliver their parts in spades . \nhawke , first off , because he rarely plays these \" commercial \" roles but does so perfectly here , with a vulnerable side which has you feeling for the bastard right off the top . \nand denzel , well , what can you say about mr . washington that hasn't already been said before ? \nhe comes through as per his usual high-level style here , and gives the audience a completely different side to his talent , of which , i personally would like to see more . \nhe's nice , he's not so nice , he's smart , he's not so smart , he's caring and he's a dog all the way . \nthe few problems that i did have with this film included the redundant nature of the whole thing at some point ( okay , we get it . . . you \nhave to be nasty in order to deal with these nasty people . . . move on ) and this one really major \" coincidence \" which involved a bathtub , that saved the day for one character , but seemed a little too \" convenient \" for my taste . \ni also never really understood how washington's character got out of a certain dire predicament , only to be seen driving his car in the very next scene . \nbut obviously these small flaws didn't taint my overall enjoyment of this tense drama , a film that gets you right into the streets , into the nooks and the crannies , and into the moral dilemma which lies between the justice system and the day-to-day drug busts . \nsee it if you want to wrestle with some of these issues yourself , see it if you want to see denzel and ethan strike up a palpable chemistry on-screen , and see it if you like holding on to your seat-handles real tight during a movie . \nin fact , see it for the scene in which ethan hawke plays cards with a host of gang-bangers alone . . . dang , now that's intense ! \nwhere's joblo coming from ? \nthe corruptor ( 7/10 ) - crimson tide ( 9/10 ) - l . a . confidential ( /10 ) - lethal weapon ( 8/10 ) - requiem for a dream (

. \nparents of girl aren't crazy about the boy . \ngirl steps to boy's defense . \nfamily problems occur . \ngirl learns more about the boy . \nboy goes nuts . \nfun ensues . \ncritique : ever wonder what would happen if your better half turned out to be someone other than the person that you had come to cherish and love ? \nwell , if you ever have , then this film is definitely for you . \nit isn't the most original premise in the world , but it is handled pretty well here , and pretty quickly for that matter ( a speedy 90 minutes ) . \ni think one of the main reasons this film worked for me is the groundbreaking performance by mark wahlberg ( of boogie nights infamy ( 7 . 5/10 ) . \nhe completely captured all the goodness , and badness , of the main character of this film , and always kept me wanting to see more and more of him ( his performance scored him a solid nomination from his core target audience , as \" best villain \" at the 1997 mtv movie awards ) . \nthe soundtrack is also very effective in this setting , and of course , the slutty performance by alyssa milano is something we could all indulge in ( look for the nice bikini and butt shots . . . if \nyou're into that kind of thing , that is : ) . \ni didn't much care for the father/david relationship which seemed to be a little too contrived , but for the most part , i was really into this movie . \nthen again , daddy dearest did have one of the coolest lines in the movie when his wife is asking him what the \" big deal \" was about his daughter dating david . \nhis reply : \" the big deal is that the guy gives me the creeps , and the girl is my daughter . \" \ngood point . \nall in all , the movie kicked some fun ass , mindless as it was , and effectively demonstrated every parent's worst nightmare . \nmind you , i still can't tell if reese witherspoon is good looking or a douchebag , but hey , life goes on . \nand on a personal note , we finally decided to add some taco meat onto our nacho fiesta of usual , and let me tell you all . . . it was a flaming success ! ! \nanother firm recommendation by joe schmoe ! \nlittle known facts : director james foley was the man responsible for the critically acclaimed glengarry glenross ( 8/10 ) back in 1992 , at close range ( 7 . 5/10 ) in 1986 , and even directed an episode of twin peaks in 1990 . \nmark wahlberg stands 5 \" 9 , is born in massachusetts , dropped out of highschool ( later got his ged ) , and was convicted of several minor felonies before starting his career as the lead singer of marky mark and the funky bunch . \nhis brother is donnie wahlberg of new kids on the block fame . \nhe is also testing the waters on the acting front . \n", "wow ! what a movie . \nit's everything a movie can be : funny , dramatic , interesting , weird , funny , weird and strikingly original . \nyep that pretty much describes this movie . \nit starts out like a regular movie and ends up being one of the weirdest , funniest most original movies i have ever seen . \nit boggles the mind and some have to wonder why we cannot get movies like this more often . \nbesides being one of the best films of the year , being john malkovich may as well be one of the best movies ever . \nperiod . \nthen again there are so many good movies , that one cannot pick an all time favorite . \njohn cusack plays a puppeteer craig schwartz a man out of a job , in search of a job . \nhis wife lotte schwartz who is played by a completely un-noticeable cameron diaz who looks like something off the streets is an animal lover and has about every kind of animal you could think of . \ncraig finds a job as a file at the 7 ? floor of a business building . . . you \nhave to pry open the elevator doors open before it reaches floor eight , the 7 ? floor is just a floor between 7 and 8 . \nhe is hired by his 105 year old boss ( orsen bean ) to be a filer . \nin his office , he discovers a little door , to which was boarded up and hidden . \nto his curiosity he opens it and starts to crawl toward it , he then gets sucked to the end and ends up in john malkovich's mind . \nfifteen minutes later he is shot out onto the side of the new jersey turnpike . \nhe returns to tell his co-worker maxine ( catherine keener ) that he has found a portal that will lead him into john malkovich's mind , she doesn't believe him but after she sees it it changes her mind . \nlotte also finds out about the portal and discovers that being someone else is good after all . \njohn malkovich of course has no idea what is going on , and by the end of this bizarre film there are so many twists and turns , that we don't know what really happened . \njohn cusack is outstanding and utterly believeable in a role only he himself could play . \nhe fits the role perfectly and to me was brilliantly cast . \ncameron diaz is outstanding and utterly one of the world's most prettiest women , is made up here unnoticeable and very unattractive . \nshe however gives a very comic performance and this could easily be her best role to date . \ncatherine keener is very funny and sexy as maxine and of course the best thing of the movie is the magic himself john malkovich who is very brilliant and this movie plays big time homage ? to the master himself . \nthe whole group combined gives us a wonderfully funny movie that is also smart and clever . \nspike jonze ( three kings ) makes his fabulous directing debut , and did a fantastic job of directing this new classic film . \nhe lets the viewer go on the trip as well as let the viewer know they are watching a movie . \nby the time the ending rolled around my head was spinning from disbelief of how good this film was . \nthe screenplay written by charlie kaufman was hilarious and often thought-provoking . \nthe film also had a soft side to it and even though the ending is very surprising it is also a little sad and heart-warming . \nthe whole movie was fantastic and had me rolling in the isles . \nfrom cameron diaz's appearence to john malkovich's explorations i laughed very hard , and it may as well be as funny as as good as it gets ( the funniest ! ) . \nthere isn't a slow point in the movie , or an overused idea . \nthere are no cliches except for the fact that this is the most original , inventie , witty , and smart movie i've seen in a long time . \ni found myself amazed by everything : the direction , acting , writing and the whole idea of the movie . \nby the end i had to wonder why hollywood doesn't want to make movies like this anymore . \nor why they don't . \nall filmmakers watch this movie and get some ideas of movies to come out . \nthis was a surprise hit as was american beauty . \n'being john malkovich' is in the top 5 movies of the year , and in the top 10 best films ever made . \nit has something that no other movies playing now has . \nin fact it may as well be the best movie out right now . \ni highly recommend 'being john malkovich' and have no doubts you will be disappointed . \n", "richard gere can be a commanding actor , but he's not always in great films . \neverything comes together here . \ngere is a big time chicago defense attorney who takes on a seemingly unwinable case in hopes of even more publicity . \nit doesn't go exactly as he expects . \ngere's client , aaron ( edward norton ) , is a shy stuttering tennessee boy who is accused of brutally murdering and mutilating a catholic archbishop . \nthe evidence is stacked against him . \nhe was caught running from the scene covered in the bishop's blood . \nhis bloody

the lawyer's proclamations that he doesn't care about the guilt of his clients and that the real thrill is gambling with people's lives , he becomes involved with aaron and is determined to free him . \nlots of complications and twists . \nthe prosecuting attorney is gere's former co-worker and lover . \nthey both work each other's motives to their legal advantages and it gets messy . \nher boss had major economic dealings with the archbishop that went sour and seems to have crime connections . \naaron gets weirder and weirder as the trial goes on . \ngere's case is falling apart and he is faced with about a dozen ethical dilemmas . \ngere is exceptional as the well-dressed reserved counselor , but just once , i wanted to see him kick back and come out of his \" suit \" persona . \neven when he loses it , you don't see very far inside . \nnorton's aaron is convincing : he comes across as the backwoods kid misplaced in the big city . \nthe supporting cast does a fine job of holding together the story . \nas with most of the effective courtroom dramas , the cinematography is crisp and rich . \nthe story will keep you on the edge of your seat . \nnothing is what it seems . \n", "glory--starring matthew broderick , denzel washington , and morgan freeman--is the true story of the 54th regiment of massachusetts , the first black fighting unit recruited by the north during the civil war . \nbroderick plays robert gould shaw , the young white officer who led the black soldiers into battle . \nshaw , the son of well-to-do abolitionists , hailed from boston high society . \nthe letters he wrote home to his parents during the war are on display at harvard , and were , evidently , the inspiration for glory . \nas the film begins in 1862 , shaw is a captain in the northern forces . \nlike private eriksson ( michael j . fox ) in casualties of war , shaw initially is naive and idealistic about the war--that is , until his company is attacked by enemy forces . \nshaw experiences first hand the horror and chaos of battle , witnessing mass slaughter and receiving a minor wound himself when a bullet grazes his neck . \nsoon after his recovery , shaw is promoted to colonel and assigned to enlist and train blacks in the war effort . \nglory is the story not only of colonel shaw , but also of the black soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery . \nthe film periodically jumps between shaw's point of view and the perspective of the black soldiers . \nthe movie introduces us to a handful of black recruits , and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action . \nthe large black cast is uniformly outstanding , especially washington who is electrifying as a runaway slave with a big mouth . \nhe is brash and pushy , always getting into trouble and always looking for a fight . \nhis bitter , tough guy facade is really just a mask for his loneliness and vulnerability . \nwashington provides much of the film's intensity and emotional power . \nin one heartbreaking scene , he is whipped for allegedly deserting the army . \nwhen he removes his shirt to receive the punishment , you cringe at the sight of his back , which is riddled with ugly scars from his days as a slave . \nit makes your blood boil . \nthe humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings ; a tear rolls down washington's cheek--and will probably run down your cheek as well . \nthe episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasn't deserting the army at all ; he left camp to look for shoes because his feet were covered with oozing sores . \nfreeman is , as usual , a strong presence , even in a small supporting role . \nhe plays a grave digger who has buried more white soldiers than he cares to remember . \nhe quickly becomes a leader among the black soldiers , holding the group together and serving as a liaison to the white officers . \ncolonel shaw recognizes freeman's leadership ability and promotes him to sergeant major , making him the first black officer in the army . \nandre braugher makes an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles , a free black who is one of shaw's close childhood friends . \nsearles is educated and refined , like a white man , prompting washington to nickname him \" snow flake . \" \nthe burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat . \nthe road from marching drills to battle action is a bumpy one for the black regiment . \nthe soldiers suffer innumerable hardships , but somehow they never lose their morale . \nthe army treats the black soldiers like second class citizens , subjecting them to racism and discrimination . \nthey are paid only $10 a month , whereas their white counterparts earn thirteen , and , for a long time , they have to go without shoes , guns , or uniforms . \nto make matters worse , the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the blacks into action , preferring instead to use them for manual labor . \neventually , however , the regiment receives its boots , uniforms , rifles , and right to fight , thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw . \nshaw has absolute faith in his soldiers , and he fights tooth and nail to get them what they deserve , even if it means threatening a general with blackmail . \nbroderick , in fact , is most convincing in the scenes where shaw stands up for the regiment . \nunfortunately , however , broderick's uneven performance is , in many respects , the weak link in the movie . \nin an effort to look more mature , broderick sports a mustache and a goatee , and throughout the film he slips in and out of a phony boston accent . \nhe is never altogether convincing as shaw since much of the time his emotions seem forced . \nthe film places too much weight on broderick's character and not enough on the black soldiers , who are more intriguing . \nglory regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction of war . \nthe movie shows the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born on the fourth of july . \nglory does not try to rattle you with nauseating blood and guts . \nexcept for a few bullet wounds and one exploding head , the film , for the most part , leaves the gore to your imagination , which is not to say that the battle scenes in glory are timid . \nto the contrary , they are chaotic and horrifying ; it's just that director edward zwick ( the co-creator of \" thirtysomething \" ) films them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster . \nthe key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldiers . \nthe movie depicts some of ( but not enough of ) their customs and rituals . \nin one scene , for example , the soldiers motivate themselves by singing prayers around the campfire . \neach man has a chance to relay a few words of inspiration . \na couple of the movie's most touching moments involve young black children looking up to the black soldiers with awe , disbelief and pride . \nthe regiment's greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves in battle , thereby earning the respect of their white peers and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner . \nlike any war film , glory has its share of gloom and despair , but ultimately it proves to be a truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson , a valuable reminder that despite what the history books say ( or , more precisely , what they do not say ) , blacks played a critically important role in the north's victory over the south--forever changing the evolution of america . \n", "steven spielberg's second epic film on world war ii is an unquestioned masterpiece of film . \nspielberg , ever the student on film , has managed to resurrect the war genre by producing one of its grittiest , and most powerful entries . \nhe also managed to cast this era's greatest answer to jimmy stewart , tom hanks , who delivers a performance that is nothing short of an astonishing miracle . \nfor about 160 out of its 170 minutes , \" saving private ryan \" is flawless . \nliterally . \nthe plot is simple enough . \nafter the epic d-day invasion ( whose sequences are nothing short of spectacular ) , capt . john miller ( hanks ) and his team are forced to search for a pvt . \njames ryan ( damon ) , whose brothers have all died in battle . \nonce they find him , they are to bring him back for immediate discharge so that he can go home . \naccompanying miller are his crew , played with astonishing perfection by a group of character actors that are simply sensational . \nbarry pepper , adam goldberg , vin diesel , giovanni ribisi , davies , and burns are the team sent to find one man , and bring him home . \nthe battle sequences that bookend the film are extraordinary . \nliterally . \nthere is nothing in film that has ever been recorded that will prepare you for the sheer onslaught of terrorizing violence in the film's first 20 minutes . \nspielberg films almost the entire movie without music , leaving it up to the characters to generate emotion , and they do to perfection . \nthe sequences in france , all of them , beginning with the battle and ending with the battle , are fabulous , especially the dialogues between the men as they walk through the hills and countrysides , trying to save private ryan . \nthere are no words i can use to describe the true horror and power of these sequences . \nthis is what coppola was looking for in \" apocalypse now \" , but couldn't create . \nthe sheer horror of these sequences all but condemn war . \nthe performance by hanks as the leader of this gang is also extraordinary . \nhe is head and shoulders above of the rest of the actors in the world , with his comic timing , dramatic flair , his quiet emotion that stirs an entire nation to tears . \nhanks is this country's finest actor , and he proves it here . \nhowever , spielberg almost destroys his own masterpiece . \nwith a chance to make it the one of the greatest films of all time , spielberg creates 10 minutes of purely worthless film . \nthe sequence involving army chief-of-stafff george marshall and mrs . ryan is decent , but doesn't hold up to the rest of the film , relying on wartime cliches to power it . \nbut that is forgivable . \nwhat isn't is the bookends of the film , the cemetary sequences . \nthe first one is quite good , a decent introduction into the lives of these men . \nthe last sequence is atrocious . \nthe forced emotion , accompanied by a ridiculous piece of music , is simply horrible compared to the rest of the magical film . \nthese flaws are what downgrade \" ryan \" from the greatest film of our era , to the greatest war film of our era . \nspielberg should have trusted his own material , and he should have trusted hanks to deliver the most chilling line of the movie , to end his masterpiece right there . \nthe use of the flag , though patriotic , is in contrast to the movie's theme . \nthe power of the bulk of the film , however , is astonishing . \nspielberg has truly made a wondrous work of art , that persists even after first viewing of the film , is extraordinary . \nthis is the film of the year . \n", "truman ( \" true-man \" ) burbank is the perfect name for jim carrey's character in this film . \npresident truman was an unassuming man who became known worldwide , in spite of ( or was it because of ) his stature . \n \" truman \" also recalls an era of plenty following a grim war , an era when planned communities built by government scientists promised an idyllic life for americans . \nand burbank , california , brings to mind the tonight show and the home of nbc . \nif hollywood is the center of the film world , burbank is , or was , the center of tv's world , the world where our protagonist lives . \ncombine all these names and concepts into \" truman burbank , \" and you get something that well describes him and his artificial world . \ntruman leads the perfect life . \nhis town , his car , and his wife are picture perfect . \nhis idea of reality comes under attack one day when a studio light falls from the sky . \nthe radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart . \n . \n . \nbut then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light ? \nthe next day during the drive to work , the radio jams and he starts picking up a voice that exactly describes his movements . \nhe is so distracted that he nearly hits a pedestrian . \nwhen the radio comes back to normal , the announcer warns listeners to drive carefully . \nhis suspicion aroused , he wanders around the town square looking for other oddities . \nthe world appears to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and tries to take the elevator . \nthe elevator doors open up on a small lounge with people on coffee breaks . \na grip sees truman him and quickly moves a paneled door , made to look like the back of an elevator , into place . \ntwo security guards grab him and throw him out . \ntruman is really suspicious now . \nit gets even worse the next day when his wife , a nurse , describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge . \n \" it's best not to think about it , \" she says , trying vainly to change truman's memory . \ntruman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense . \nat every turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own little town . \nhis last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edge of the world . \nyou know by now that truman's life is the subject of a television program . \nhis actions are \" real \" but everything else is carefully scripted , from the death of his father to the choice of his wife . \ntruman is determined to find out what the big hoax is . \nmeanwhile , christof , the all-seeing creator of truman's world does his best to keep him unaware and happy . \nit's sort of like westworld told from the robots' point of view , or jurassic park from the dinosaurs' point of view . \nwe root for the captive of the cage-world . \nour protagonist is counting on \" chaos theory \" to help him escape his elaborate trap . \nthe story , written by andrew niccol ( writer/director of gattaca ) , introduces some interesting questions , such as the ethics of subjecting a person to this type of life , or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life has all been fake . \nalthough these questions came to mind , i don't think the film itself asked them . \nit certainly didn't address them or try to answer them . \ni was particularly disappointed that the film didn't deal more with the trauma of learning one's life is a tv show . \ncarrey's performance at the end showed a smidgen of truman's pain , but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the film's pacing . \nearlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well . \nthe two seemed exclusive of one another , but weir and niccol didn't see it that way . \nperhaps it's not fair to criticize a movie for what it isn't , but it seems like there were some missed opportunities here . \nbut on its own terms , the movie is well made . \nsight , sound and pacing are all handled competently . \nmuch of the first part of the movie is the truman show . \nthe scenes are all apparently shot from hidden cameras , with snoots and obstructions covering the corners of the screen . \none hidden camera is apparently in his car radio , the green led numbers obscuring the lower part of the screen . \nthe music is well-chosen and scored . \nthe film opens with what sounds like family drama theme music , when truman's world is still beautiful and perfect . \nwhen the movie ends , the score sounds more like a frantic , driven , tangerine dream opus , while still keeping the same timbre . \nphilip glass' epic music ( from powaqqatsi ) permeates truman's scenes of suspicion and awakening . \n ( glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show . ) \nand the pacing of the story was brisk . \nthere was no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show , just a few quick title cards , a few interviews , and then right into the show , and the movie . \none of the first scenes is of the studio light falling ; there was no token scene of truman's idyllic life before it falls apart , because it wasn't necessary , we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble , and no sooner . \nthere's also no point in the movie where the plot slows down . \nit's a quick , straight shot to the movie's end . \nin terms of overall quality , i would compare the truman show to niccol's gattaca . \nboth films are well made with interesting stories set in interesting worlds . \nbut neither film really felt like it capitalized on all the great ideas ; neither film \" clicked \" and became an instant classic . \nnevertheless , i look forward to niccol's next film , whatever it may be . \n", "plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . \nthey get into an accident . \none of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . \nwhat's the deal ? \nwatch the movie and \" sorta \" find out . . . \ncritique : a mind-fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . \nwhich is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just didn't snag this one correctly . \nthey seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . \nso what are the problems with the movie ? \nwell , its main problem is that it's simply too jumbled . \nit starts off \" normal \" but then downshifts into this \" fantasy \" world in which you , as an audience member , have no idea what's going on . \nthere are dreams , there are characters coming back from the dead , there are others who look like the dead , there are strange apparitions , there are disappearances , there are a looooot of chase scenes , there are tons of weird things that happen , and most of it is simply not explained . \nnow i personally don't mind trying to unravel a film every now and then , but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again , i get kind of fed up after a while , which is this film's biggest problem . \nit's obviously got this big secret to hide , but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes . \nand do they make things entertaining , thrilling or even engaging , in the meantime ? \nnot really . \nthe sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half-way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still didn't the make the film all that more entertaining . \ni guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is \" into it \" even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding . \ni mean , showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! ! \nokay , we get it . . . there \nare people chasing her and we don't know who they are . \ndo we really need to see it over and over again ? \nhow about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie ? \napparently , the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves , and it shows . \nthere might've been a pretty decent teen mind-fuck movie in here somewhere , but i guess \" the suits \" decided that turning it into a music video with little edge , would make more sense . \nthe actors are pretty good for the most part , although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty , only in a new neighborhood . \nbut my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller , who holds her own throughout the entire film , and actually has you feeling her character's unraveling . \noverall , the film doesn't stick because it doesn't entertain , it's confusing , it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime , despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it . \noh , and by the way , this is not a horror or teen slasher flick . . . it's \njust packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids . \nit also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since . \nwhatever . . . skip \nit ! \nwhere's joblo coming from ? \na nightmare of elm street 3 ( 7/10 ) - blair witch 2 ( 7/10 ) - the crow ( 9/10 ) - the crow : salvation ( 4/10 ) - lost highway ( 10/10 ) - memento ( 10/10 ) - the others ( 9/10 ) -

. . \ngoing for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there , virus still feels very empty , like a movie going for all flash and no substance . \nwe don't know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere , we don't know the origin of what took over the ship ( just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir ) , and , of course , we don't know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout . \nhere , it's just \" hey , let's chase these people around with some robots \" . \nthe acting is below average , even from the likes of curtis . \nyou're more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h20 . \nsutherland is wasted and baldwin , well , he's acting like a baldwin , of course . \nthe real star here are stan winston's robot design , some

\nof course , the ads make it seem like so much more . \nquick cuts , cool music , claire dane's nice hair and cute outfits , car chases , stuff blowing up , and the like . \nsounds like a cool movie , does it not ? \nafter the first fifteen minutes , it quickly becomes apparent that it is not . \nthe mod squad is certainly a slick looking production , complete with nice hair and costumes , but that simply isn't enough . \nthe film is best described as a cross between an hour-long cop show and a music video , both stretched out into the span of an hour and a half . \nand with it comes every single clich ? . \nit doesn't really matter that the film is based on a television show , as most of the plot elements have been recycled from everything we've already seen . \nthe characters and acting is nothing spectacular , sometimes even bordering on wooden . \nclaire danes and omar epps deliver their lines as if they are bored , which really transfers onto the audience . \nthe only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi , who plays the resident crazy man , ultimately being the only thing worth watching . \nunfortunately , even he's not enough to save this convoluted mess , as all the characters don't do much apart from occupying screen time . \nwith the young cast , cool clothes , nice hair , and hip soundtrack , it appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset . \ndespite an american 'r' rating ( which the content does not justify ) , the film is way too juvenile for the older mindset . \ninformation on the characters is literally spoon-fed to the audience ( would it be that hard to show us instead of telling us ? ) , dialogue is poorly written , and the plot is extremely predictable . \nthe way the film progresses , you likely won't even care if the heroes are in any jeopardy , because you'll know they aren't . \nbasing the show on a 1960's television show that nobody remembers is of questionable wisdom , especially when one considers the target audience and the fact that the number of memorable films based on television shows can be counted on one hand ( even one that's missing a finger or two ) . \nthe number of times that i checked my watch ( six ) is a clear indication that this film is not one of them . \nit is clear that the film is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the teenage spending dollar , judging from the rash of really awful teen-flicks that we've been seeing as of late . \navoid this film at all costs . \n", " \" quest for camelot \" is warner bros . ' first feature-length , fully-animated attempt to steal clout from disney's cartoon empire , but the mouse has no reason to be worried . \nthe only other recent challenger to their throne was last fall's promising , if flawed , 20th century fox production \" anastasia , \" but disney's \" hercules , \" with its lively cast and colorful palate , had her beat hands-down when it came time to crown 1997's best piece of animation . \nthis year , it's no contest , as \" quest for camelot \" is pretty much dead on arrival . \neven the magic kingdom at its most mediocre -- that'd be \" pocahontas \" for those of you keeping score -- isn't nearly as dull as this . \nthe story revolves around the adventures of free-spirited kayley ( voiced by jessalyn gilsig ) , the early-teen daughter of a belated knight from king arthur's round table . \nkayley's only dream is to follow in her father's footsteps , and she gets her chance when evil warlord ruber ( gary oldman ) , an ex-round table member-gone-bad , steals arthur's magical sword excalibur and accidentally loses it in a dangerous , booby-trapped forest . \nwith the help of hunky , blind timberland-dweller garrett ( carey elwes ) and a two-headed dragon ( eric idle and don rickles ) that's always arguing with itself , kayley just might be able to break the medieval sexist mold and prove her worth as a fighter on arthur's side . \n \" quest for camelot \" is missing pure showmanship , an essential element if it's ever expected to climb to the high ranks of disney . \nthere's nothing here that differentiates \" quest \" from something you'd see on any given saturday morning cartoon -- subpar animation , instantly forgettable songs , poorly-integrated computerized footage . \n ( compare kayley and garrett's run-in with the angry ogre to herc's battle with the hydra . \ni rest my case . ) \neven the characters stink -- none of them are remotely interesting , so much that the film becomes a race to see which one can out-bland the others . \nin the end , it's a tie -- they all win . \nthat dragon's comedy shtick is awfully cloying , but at least it shows signs of a pulse . \nat least fans of the early-'90s tgif television line-up will be thrilled to find jaleel \" urkel \" white and bronson \" balki \" pinchot sharing the same footage . \na few scenes are nicely realized ( though i'm at a loss to recall enough to be specific ) , and the actors providing the voice talent are enthusiastic ( though most are paired up with singers who don't sound a thing like them for their big musical moments -- jane seymour and celine dion ? ? ? ) . \nbut one must strain through too much of this mess to find the good . \naside from the fact that children will probably be as bored watching this as adults , \" quest for camelot \" 's most grievous error is its complete lack of personality . \nand personality , we learn from this mess , goes a very long way . \n", "synopsis : a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boy's mother , a fledgling restauranteur . \nunsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman's favor , he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way . \ncomments : stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned-psychos-getting-their-revenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry , both theatrical and direct-to-video . \ntheir proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they're typically inexpensive to produce ( no special effects , no big name stars ) and serve as vehicles to flash nudity ( allowing them to frequent late-night cable television ) . \nstalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect : the psycho never actually has an affair ; on the contrary , he's rejected rather quickly ( the psycho typically is an ex-lover , ex-wife , or ex-husband ) . \nother than that , stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable . \nstalked does not provide much suspense , though that is what it sets out to do . \ninterspersed throughout the opening credits , for instance , a serious-sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk ( it's implicitly implied that all stalkers are men ) while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen . \nafter these credits , a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears . \nthe narrator states that \" this is the story of daryl gleason \" and tells the audience that he is the stalker . \nof course , really , this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels . \nif the movie was meant to be about daryl , then it should have been called stalker not stalked . \nokay . so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts ; no guesswork required . \nstalked proceeds , then , as it begins : obvious , obvious , obvious . \nthe opening sequence , contrived quite a bit , brings daryl and brooke ( the victim ) together . \ndaryl obsesses over brooke , follows her around , and tries to woo her . \nultimately rejected by her , his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate . \nthese plans include the all-time , psycho-in-love , cliche : the murdered pet . \nfor some reason , this genre's films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked . \nstalked is no exception ( it's a cat this time -- found in the shower ) . \nevents like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked , where only one survives ( guess who it invariably always is and you'll guess the conclusion to this turkey ) . \nstalked's cast is uniformly adequate : not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either . \njay underwood , as the stalker , turns toward melodrama a bit too much . \nhe overdoes it , in other words , but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands . \nmaryam d'abo , about the only actor close to being a star here ( she played the bond chick in the living daylights ) , is equally adequate as the \" stalked \" of the title , even though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong , independent business-owner . \nbrooke ( d'abo ) needs to be ditzy , however , for the plot to proceed . \ntoward the end , for example , brooke has her suspicions about daryl . \nto ensure he won't use it as another excuse to see her , brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his house . \ndoes she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers ? \nof course not . \nshe tries the door , opens it , and wanders around the house . \nwhen daryl returns , he enters the house , of course , so our heroine is in danger . \nsomehow , even though her car is parked at the front of the house , right by the front door , daryl is oblivious to her presence inside . \nthe whole episode places an incredible strain on the audience's suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either character's intelligence . \nstalked receives two stars because , even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring , it is not so bad that it cannot be watched . \nrated r mostly for several murder scenes and brief nudity in a strip bar , it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are . \nif you're in the mood for a good suspense film , though , stake out something else . \n", "capsule : in 2176 on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace . \nthere is a lot of fighting and not a whole lot of story otherwise . \njohn carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films , especially assault on precinct 13 , that the new film comes off as his homage to himself . \n , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) . \njohn carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes . \nfor a writer and director of horror films , supposedly an expert on horror , it is a very bad mistake to make . \nghosts of mars is called a horror movie , but it is more just a drawn out fight between humans and a surprisingly low-powered alien menace . \nin addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars , carpenter would have grounds to sue . \nthis film is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct 13 , the thing , and prince of darkness . \nit is , in fact , surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way . \nbut that still does not make for a really good science fiction experience . \nghosts of mars takes place in the year 2176 . \nmars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear ( which is good for the film's budget ) . \nit is never mentioned , but the gravity on mars has been increased somehow to earth-normal , again making it easier to film . \nsociety has changed a bit by that time , but it has advanced surprisingly little . \napparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control . \nand from carpenter's view , women have really made a mess of things . \nsociety has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in ten . \nthe basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct 13 except that precinct 9 ( yes , precinct 9 ) has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony . \ninstead of having the criminal \" napolean \" wilson , this film has the criminal \" desolation \" williams . \ninstead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face , well , ghosts of mars . \nbecause the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner , but they essentially behave as human savages , in another lapse of imagination . \nthe story is told in flashback , flashback within flashback , and flashback within flashback within flashback . \nghosts of mars takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red , yellow , and black . \ncarpenter manages to give us a powerful opening scene , showing a mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with a heavy beat . \nsadly what follows is not really up to the buildup . \nthe terror he creates looks a little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss . \nhis idea of building suspense is having a bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring . \nthese are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience . \nsomewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights . \nwithin a short stretch of time we have seen the release of mission to mars , red planet , and ghosts of mars . \nafter mission to mars was panned by too many reviewers it looks better and better and better as time goes by . \ni rate ghosts of mars a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \nfollowing the movie i showed my wife , who liked ghosts of mars moderately more than i did , carpenter's classic assault on precinct 13 . \nher comment is that it was seeing the same film twice . \n", "so ask yourself what \" 8mm \" ( \" eight millimeter \" ) is really all about . \nis it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy , sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography ? \nis it about the business itself , how , bubbling just beneath the surface of big-town americana , there's a sordid world of sick and depraved people who won't necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires ? \nor is it about those who can , those who are in a position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see ? \ni'm not talking about snuff films , supposed \" documentaries \" of victims being brutalized and killed on camera . \ni'm talking about films like \" 8mm \" and its director , joel schumacher . \nwith a recent run of big budget movies to his credit-- \" batman & robin , \" \" a time to kill , \" \" batman forever , \" \" the client \" --schumacher certainly has that kind of influence . \nis \" 8mm \" something you really want to see ? \nprobably not . \nthe first two-thirds of \" 8mm \" unwind as a fairly conventional missing persons drama , albeit with a particularly unsavory core . \nthen , as it's been threatening all along , the film explodes into violence . \nand just when you think it's finally over , schumacher tags on a ridiculous self-righteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further . \ntrust me . \nthere are better ways to waste two hours of your life . \nnicolas ' \" snake eyes \" ' cage plays private investigator tom welles who is hired by a wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whether a reel of film found in her late husband's safe documents a young girl's murder . \nwelles goes about his assignment rather matter-of-factly , and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly , almost as if you don't need any specialized skills or training to do this . \nwelles certainly makes it look easy . \nand cops , obviously , never look in toilet tanks for clues . \nthe deeper welles digs into his investigation the more obsessed he becomes , like george c . scott in paul schrader's \" hardcore . \" \noccasionally , a little flickering sound whirs in his head like sprockets winding through a film projector , reminding him of his unpleasant task . \nthere are hints that this is taking its toll on his lovely wife , played by catherine keener , who is frustrated by her husband spending all of his time in cleveland rather than in their ugly split-level home in harrisburg , pa . \n \" 8mm \" doesn't condemn or condone its subject matter , it just exploits it . \nthe irony , of course , is that schumacher and \" seven \" scribe andrew kevin walker's vision of life in the snuff lane is limited by what they can show in an r-rated , first-run hollywood product . \nso we only see snippets of snuff , and a lot more footage of nicolas cage covering his face in horror . \nlater it's the turn of joaquin phoenix ( who's quite good and by far the film's most interesting character as adult bookstore flunky max california ) to cover his face as the horrid thing is screened over and over again . \nall this to get to the familiar yet offensive \" revelation \" that sexual deviants are not , indeed , monsters but everyday people like you and me . \nneither super nor standard , \" 8mm \" is shocking only in its banality . \n", "that's exactly how long the movie felt to me . \nthere weren't even nine laughs in nine months . \nit's a terrible mess of a movie starring a terrible mess of a man , mr . hugh grant , a huge dork . \nit's not the whole oral-sex/prostitution thing ( referring to grant , not me ) that bugs me , it's the fact that grant is annoying . \nnot just adam sandler-annoying , we're talking jim carrey-annoying . \nsince when do eye flutters and nervous smiles pass for acting ? \nbut , on the other hand , since when do really bad slapstick ( a fistfight in the delivery room culminating in grant's head in joan cusack's lap--a scene he paid $60 to have included in the movie ) and obscene double entendres ( robin williams , the obstetrician , tells grant's pregnant girlfriend she has \" a big pussy , \" referring of course to the size of the cat hairs on her coat , but nonetheless , grant paid $60 to have the exchange included in the movie ) pass for comedy ? \nnine months is a predictable cookie-cutter movie with no originality in humor or plot . \nhugh grant plays a successful child psychiatrist . \nwhy a child psychologist ? \nso the scriptwriters could inject the following unfunny exchange : \nkid : my dad's an asshole . \ngrant ( flutters eyelashes , offers a nervous smile , then responds in his annoying english accent and i-think-i-actually-have- talent attitude ) : could you possibly elaborate on that ? \nkid : my dad's a _huge_ asshole . \nmore like a hugh asshole , but that's beside the point , which is : nine months includes too many needlessly stupid jokes that get laughs from the ten year olds in the audience while everyone else shakes his or her head in disbelief . \nso , anyway , grant finds out his girlfriend is pregnant and does his usual reaction ( fluttered eyelashes , nervous smiles ) . \nthis paves the way for every possible pregnancy/child birth gag in the book , especially since grant's equally annoying friend's wife is also pregnant . \nthe annoying friend is played by tom arnold , who provides most of the cacophonous slapstick , none of which is funny , such as a scene where arnold beats up a costumed \" arnie the dinosaur \" ( you draw your own parallels on that one ) in a toy store . \nthe only interesting character in the movie is played by jeff goldblum , who should have hid himself away somewhere after the dreadful hideaway , as an artist with a fear of ( and simultaneous longing for ) commitment . \nnot even robin williams , who plays a russian doctor who has recently decided to switch from veterinary medicine to obstetrics , has much humor . \nhis is a one-joke character-- the old foreign-guy-who-mispronounces-english stereotype ( did someone say yakov smirnov ? \nthat's my favorite vodka , by the way ) , hence the line \" now it's time to take a look at your volvo , \" another nasty but unamusing joke , except this one goes right over the ten year olds' heads , while the adults simultaneously groan . \nnine months is a complete failure , low on laughs and intelligence and high on loud , unfunny slapstick , failed jokes and other uninspired lunacy . \nhugh grant's sunset boulevard arrest ( please , no caught-with-his-pants-down jokes ) may bring more people into the theaters , but they certainly won't leave with a smile on their faces , not after 90 minutes of grant's nervous smiles . \neverything in the movie is so forced , so unauthentic that anyone with an i . q . \nover 80 ( sorry , hugh ) will know they wasted their money on an unfulfilled desire . \nbut at least they didn't spend 60 bucks for it . \n", "call it a road trip for the walking wounded . \nstellan skarsg ? rd plays such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that it's difficult to spend nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly , boozed-out presence . \nyet this ever-reliable swedish actor adds depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen , a sentimental and painfully mundane european drama . \nplaywright august strindberg built his career on families and relationships paralyzed by secrets , unable to express their longings until the hour is far too late . \nthat's an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for , focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father , tomas ( skarsg ? rd ) and his alienated , openly hostile yuppie daughter , kaisa ( lena headey , gossip ) . \nthey haven't spoken in years , and wouldn't even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen , scotland by automobile if it weren't for kaisa's mother ( charlotte rampling , under the sand ) rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer . \nin a soap opera twist , mother has only a few days to live . \n ( only in the movies , right ? ) \ntoo blitzed to even step foot on a plane , tomas hits the open road with kaisa . \nloathing each other all the while , they make periodic stops for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out -- whenever he isn't muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be . \ndespite his sloshed viewpoint , tomas recognizes that the apple hasn't fallen very far from the tree . \nkaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke , sabotages her personal relationships through indifference , and is unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper . \nain't they a pair ? \nunable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the one-note and repetitively bitchy dialogue , screenwriters kristin amundsen and hans petter moland fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events forward -- lost money , roving street hooligans looking for drunks to kick around , nosy cops , and flat tires all figure into the schematic and convenient narrative . \nby the time they reach the hospital , it's time to unveil the secrets from a dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the father-daughter conflict , they're also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe . \nthis revelation exists purely for its own sake . \naberdeen doesn't know where else to go . \nweak , unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of kaisa . \nif lena headey were a stronger actress , perhaps aberdeen could have been able to coast on the performances and moody , haunting cinematography ( rendering norway into its own pastoral ghost world -- the reference to a certain superior american indie flick intentional ) . \nheadey's too busy acting , using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of insouciance . \nif she were paying any attention to skarsg ? rd , maybe she'd figure out that doing less can reveal so much more . \nit's worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001 , jonathan nossiter's captivating signs & wonders . \nit's not just because skarsg ? rd and rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films ( they're not bound by ceremonial wedlock in aberdeen ) . \nthe differences in the way their characters were presented is significant . \nin aberdeen , rampling is a luminous diva , preening and static in her hospital bed . \ndespite skarsg ? rd's solid performance as tomas , his pathetic drunk is never given much of a chance to emote anything besides catatonic sorrow . \nthere's genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during their understated confrontations in signs & wonders , allowing them to suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and years of stifled curiosity . \nnossiter's film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain . \nif signs & wonders sometimes feels overloaded with ideas , at least it's willing to stretch beyond what we've come to expect from traditional drama . \naberdeen is never half so ambitious , content to sleepwalk through the rhythms and timing of other movies . \nwhen did character driven stories stop paying attention to the complexities of real life ? \nthe depressing answer can be found in lawrence kasdan's trite but occasionally useful grand canyon , where steve martin's hollywood mogul pronounces , \" all of life's riddles are answered in the movies ! \" \neven foreign films are taking that advice to heart . \n", "plot : a young french boy sees his parents killed before his eyes by tim roth , oops . . . i \nmean , an evil man . \nhe vows revenge on that man and is taught the ways of the

was little reason to care for anyone and since when were the musketeers fat ? \ni will give the movie this much , and that is that its main reason for being ( its \" raison-d'etre \" , as the french would say ) , its fight sequences , do come through despite the lack of their numbers in the film . \ni was hoping that the movie would be packed with cool stuntwork as promoted in its trailer , but what you see there , are essentially the snippets from the two major ( and cool ) swashbuckling sequences from the film . \nthe first comes right at the beginning of the movie , while the other essentially finishes the film off , hanging from the tower and juggling off ladders . \nthe ladder sequence itself is a definite keeper but unfortunately the rest of the movie is just regurgitated crap . \nand can anyone please tell me how catherine deneuve got her name placed at the top of this film's credits ? \nhullo ? \nthe film is called the musketeer and stars a dude name justin chambers

goodnight ) , he's only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do . \nif you want to see some brilliant acting , check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach's hidden agenda . \ncox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l . i . e . , which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge . \nbig john feels the love that dares not speak its name , but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad . \nwhat bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light . \nhe's an even-tempered , funny , robust old man who actually listens to the kids' problems ( as opposed to their parents and friends , both caught up in the high-wire act of their own confused lives . ) \nhe'll have sex-for-pay with them only after an elaborate courtship , charming them with temptations from the grown-up world . \nl . i . e . stands for long island expressway , which slices through the strip malls and middle-class homes of suburbia . \nfilmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a ( pretty transparent ) metaphor of dangerous escape for his 15-year old protagonist , howie ( paul franklin dano ) . \nin his opening voice-over , howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road , citing the l . i . e . \nhighway deaths of filmmaker alan j . pakula , songwriter harry chapin , and his own mother on exit 52 . \nhe's both fascinated and disturbed by the l . i . e . , and those feelings are

usual child molesters seen in movies -- he's a beast , but ashamed of it . ) \nl . i . e . would have worked best as a half-hour short film about howie's ill-advised foray into big john's haven . \nthere is unnecessary padding with howie's miserable dad ( bruce altman ) in the hot seat for a white-collar crime , degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middle-class houses , and some homoerotic shenanigans with wise-ass gary terrio ( billy kay ) , a handsome artful dodger . \nrather than add to the themes of suburban ennui ( not that we needed another movie on that subject ) , these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length . \nconcurrently , the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted . \ncox , sporting a baseball cap and a faded marine tattoo , is all bluff and bluster . \ndano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent . \nwe're so used to child actors whose

's screenplay doesn't always give them the best material . \nwhen howie reads big john a walt whitman poem , the moment feels a bit too precious . \ndirector michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john , who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bach's goldberg variations . \nit's too much . \nthere are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big john's other boy toy ( walter masterson ) , jealous over the newbie . \nthis plot thread predictably leads to violence . \nnot content to be a haunting , observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world ( like terry zwigoff's superb ghost world ) , cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note . \nit's typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet , sparing the writers from actually having to come up with a complex , philosophical note . \nin this regard , l . i . e . \n ( and countless other indie films ) share something in common with blockbuster action films : problems are solved when the obstacle is removed . \nhow often does real life work this way ? \nto extend the question : if a movie is striving for realism , do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion ? \n", "janeane garofalo in a romantic comedy -- it was a good idea a couple years ago with the truth about cats and dogs but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker . \nthis is a by-the-books movie that plods along on a predestined course with no surprises and very few laughs . \nit also jumps on the ever-popular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there , too . \ngarofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator ( jay o . sanders ) running for reelection . \ndenis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal- plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent that's made the kennedy family so popular . \nso leary orders garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relatives to exploit . \nshe soon learns why \" easier said than done \" is the mantra of movies like this . \nthe matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that can go wrong -- garofalo has to take a tiny plane to ireland , almost misses the bus to town , can't get a hotel room , ends up in the smallest , trashiest one around , has a dog piss on her luggage , and so on . \nthen comes what roger ebert calls the \" meet cute . \" \nit happens in every romance : the man and woman have to meet each other for the first time in some unconventional , cinematic way . \nin the matchmaker , it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom and finds a nude sean ( david o'hara ) in the bathtub , his dog sitting at his side . \nno points for guessing it's the same dog that just made water on her luggage . \nalso no points for guessing garofalo hates o'hara on sight . \nthat's how it works in movies like these . \ni know from the instant i saw that irishman in the bathtub that she'd hate him for awhile , then succumb to his charms , live happily for a reel or so before allowing some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil , after which they'd reconcile in time for a happy irish tune to play over the end credits . \ni haven't mentioned the movie's twist yet . \ngarofalo comes to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival , during which lonely folks from around the county pair off into a future of bliss . \nmilo o'shea ( who looks like an irish tom snyder ) is the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together . \nrest assured he'll do all he can to match up garofalo and o'hara . \noh , and in keeping with the matchmaker's utter predictability , he dies toward the end . \nwhat the message here ? \nsometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction , like garofalo , will sell out with a weak script . \ni was excited to see garofalo and leary in the same movie , but they actually only have two or three scenes together . \nleary stays stateside , for the most part , yelling at garofalo over the phone and generally being an asshole . \nhe even undoes himself with the old microphone's still on after he's done giving the speech cliche . \nboth of them should have known better . \n", "and now the high-flying hong kong style of filmmaking has made its way down to the classics , and it isn't pretty . \nthis time out the nod to asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer , a version of dumas's the three musketeers . \nby bringing in popular asian actor/stunt coordinator xing xing xiong -- whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez -- our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting . \nthe end result is a tepid and dull action/adventure rip-off that stinks of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu . \nthe story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay . \nd'artagnan ( justin chambers ) is the vengeful son of a slain musketeer . \nhe travels to paris to join the royal musketeers and find the man that killed his parents . \nin paris , he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu ( stephen rea ) , who is trying to overthrow the king , and richelieu's man-in-black associate febre ( tim roth ) , the killer of his folks . \nhe finds the musketeers in paris disbanded and drunk , so he rounds up aramis ( nick moran ) , athos ( jan gregor kremp ) and porthos ( steven spiers ) to free the musketeer's wrongfully imprisoned leader treville from the king's prison . \nd'artagnan and his new frisky love interest/chambermaid francesca ( mena suvari ) play footsy and coo at each other as the cardinal hunts down the musketeers until finally the queen ( catherine deneuve ) ends up being captured by the menancing febre , forcing the musketeers to regroup , with d'artagnan leading the charge , and save the day . \ndirector peter hyams ( end of days ) obviously wanted to blend eastern and western filmmaking styles , but here it's a disaster . \none problem is that , in reality , most eastern films have taken their lead from western ones . \njet li's high risk is a rip-off of die hard -- not the other way around . \nironically , there is awfully little swordplay or action in the film at all -- maybe ten minutes of swashbuckling spread over five scenes . \nmost asian action films carry the bulk of their production with 20- to 30-minute action sequences , because they know the scenes have to carry the picture . \nthe musketeer instead weighs itself down with a predictable and monotonous screenplay by gene quintano ( sudden death ) , horrible acting by stephen rea and tim roth , and the prosaic attempt of justin chambers ( the wedding planner ) to deliver his mousy self as a leader . \nchambers' d'artangnan isn't a musketeer -- he's a mouseketeer ! \nand hyam's use of candles and torches to light the grime and filth of 17th century paris are well-noted , but that's the only standout in an overall flat production . \n", "a movie like mortal kombat : annihilation works ( and must be reviewed on ) multiple levels . \nfirst , there's the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie . \nbut occasionaly , almost as if making an ironic , self-depreciating remark , the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery . \nno no . . . \njust kidding . \nhad you going there for a moment , didn't i ? \nin all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games . \nthe first movie ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth ( and it's 5 billion inhabitants ) . \nthe mortals won , and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth . \nunfortunately , shao khan was a poor loser , and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway , ready to take over the planet , as our heroes assumed a fighting stance . \nthe first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who are fans of the game . \ni'd even go so far as to say that many folks who didn't know about the game probably enjoyed the movie . \nthe writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself , and they didn't try to overachieve . \nthere were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot . \nand , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box office . \nmortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off , with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie . \nshao khan has decided that he's going to take over the earth * anyways * , and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament . \nthereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain stupid . \none gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought \" hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now . \" \ntoo bad they didn't simply stick with the formula from the first movie . \ni could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture , but here are the high points : \n * the acting is truly bad . \nsandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie ) . \n * in one of the worst pieces of mis-casting i think i've * ever * seen , james remar plays raiden , the god of thunder . \nin the first movie , christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke : a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics . \ni generally like it when actors are cast against type ( tim \" tiny \" lister , jr . being cast as the president of the u . s . in the fifth element , for example ) , and remar has always been one of my favorite \" utility \" actors but he's so totally wrong for this part that he doesn't even have the luxury of amused self-awareness . \n * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important , but then never seen again . \n * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks , including a muddled scene where liu kang ( robin shou ) seeks out nightwolf ( litefoot ) , has a mystical hallucination , and then wanders off with jade ( irina pantaeva ) . \nfor these reasons ( and many others ) , i can only give the movie a 2 . . . \n . . . unless you're a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie . \nin that case , the following critiques also apply : \n * sandra hess , while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson ( who played sonya blade in the first movie ) , is much more convincing as a fighter . \nwilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer . \nhess looks like she actually knows some martial arts , and puts together a much more believable fight scene . \n * in the fights , each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game ( and often more ) . \nsonya does her \" kiss of death , \" jax does his \" earthquake , \" liu kang does his \" animality , \" and so on . \na big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely . \n * there aren't as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first , because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between . \nsilly , silly folks . \nand the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud-wrestling match . \nlame and so obviously sexist even i ( politically incorrect , for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon it . \n * the special effects are generally better , except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their \" animalities . \" \nmotaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie . \nfor folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games , i give this a 5 . \nyou'll probably like it , but not nearly as much as you liked the first one . \n", "she was the femme in \" la femme nikita . \" \nhe was the baldwin in \" backdraft , \" \" sliver , \" and \" fair game \" ( with cindy crawford ) . \ntogether , anne parillaud and william baldwin conspire to make \" shattered image \" the biggest piece of hooey since the stallone/stone \" thriller \" \" the specialist . \" \nthe film poses the question \" what if the life you're living now is really a dream , and your dreams reality ? \" \nit's either about a woman who's haunted by a recurring ( and recurring and recurring ) nightmare that she's a hired assassin , or it's about a hired assassin who's haunted by a recurring ( and recurring and recurring ) nightmare that she's honeymooning with william baldwin in jamaica . \nit doesn't much matter and believe me by the time \" shattered image \" runs its painful and pedestrian course you won't care . \nthese two lives , with parillaud looking like siouxsie sioux with a black wig , black emotionless eyes , and black leather clothing in the seattle-based assassin scenes , and moping around like karen carpenter in the jamaica scenes , play out endlessly throughout the film and the result is it's now * twice * as boring as it might have been . \nit's not that complicated plots can't be entertaining . \nof course it helps if you have interesting characters , crisp dialogue , and a modicum of style . \n \" shattered image \" isn't complex , it's just stupid . \nand boring . \nparillaud and baldwin , who aren't exactly shakespearean material to begin with , are saddled with such leaden dialogue that their characters have zero chance of breaking free of their cardboard confines . \nlines like : \n \" you don't beg , you insist . \ni like that in a woman . \" \nthat's parillaud's character talking . . . \nto her cat ! \nand : \n \" you're not the reason i couldn't care less about you . \" \nhuh ? \nand this wonderful bathroom interchange early in the film : \n \" if you give me a couple of minutes you know i'll charm the pants off you . \" \n \" i don't have that kind of time . \" \ntalking of pants , parillaud has her clothes off faster than you can say \" point of no return . \" \nwe have come to expect this from billy baldwin , but it might have been nice to have learned something about their characters first . \nbut there's nothing to learn . \nkaren is as interesting as a cereal box , a someone's-out-to-get-me crybaby who imagines the voice at the other end of the phone , the stranger who sends her flowers , maybe even her husband himself , is her would-be killer . \nsiouxsie is the chromium cool , tough-as-nails crack killing machine who shoots out a couple of mirrors in order to justify the film's meaningless stock title . \nbaldwin seems more interested in parillaud's nest egg ( so that he can pave paradise and put up a parking lot ) than he does in her . \neach time graham greene shows up he gets killed . \nbarbet schroeder ( \" reversal of fortune \" ) co-produced and should be ashamed of himself . \nevery now and again it's fun to watch a really bad movie . \nand every now and again , as \" shattered image \" makes agonizingly clear , it isn't . \n", "john carpenter makes b-movies . \nalways has ( \" halloween , \" \" escape from new york , \" \" the thing \" ) and , by the looks of it ( \" they live , \" \" escape from l . a . , \" \" vampires \" ) , always will . \ncarpenter's latest horror opus with a science fiction bent ( or science fiction outing with a schlock horror bent ) is the aptly-titled \" john carpenter's ghosts of mars \" ( in case , i suppose , you went looking for someone else's \" ghosts of mars \" ) . \nlike all those films prefixed by the very possessive \" john carpenter's , \" \" ghosts of mars \" is an unashamed b-movie punctuated by a b-movie plot , b-movie actors , and b-movie special effects . \nin category one , above , we have a storyline that borders on idiotic ( and , at times , chaotic ) . \ndormant martians ( i . e . , swirling red gases ) awakened by meddling humans possess the souls of hapless mining colonists rendering them testy marilyn manson lookalikes . \nall this explained ( in flashback ) to some grand pooh-bah counsel by martian police official melanie ballard ( natasha henstridge , from the sub- \" species \" films ) , the only returnee on a silly-looking train . \nofficer ballard went in to bring back incarcerated felon james \" desolation \" williams ; what she found was not a pretty picture . \nin the second category we have ms . henstridge , her blonde hair pulled back tightly and awkwardly into a ponytail , ice cube ( as the appropriately-named \" desolation \" ) , pam grier ( briefly , oddly--who wanted to work with whom i wonder ? ) , and a host of extras all assuming that the story and special effects were going to carry this film and therefore they didn't need to try too hard . \nin category number three we have , in addition to those swirling red gases and the silly-looking train , a couple of bird's-eye-view shots of a sprawling martian metropolis ( reddish also ) . \nstate-of-the-art special effects have never been a carpenter trademark and once again the writer/director ( who seems to have no problem finding work , however ) doesn't waste any of the film's budget in that department . \n \" ghosts of mars \" is lock , laughing stock , and barrel all your standard carpenter fare : dingy interiors , cluttered exteriors , inane dialogue , lots of leather , scarred , crazed-looking aliens , and lots and lots of weaponry . \nthe film often and always explodes into warfare without warning--spontaneously , stupidly . \ncarpenter might like to think he's made a western here but it's a western without any real heroes , villains , or border conflicts . \nit's just the shootouts minus a hissing snake plissken . \ni never thought i'd miss the guy but i do . \nit's not * all * the same , however . \ndubbed the \" one-note wonder \" for his minimalist music soundtracks , carpenter seems to have graduated from simplistic ( yet effective ) scoring by highlighting his action with loud , screeching guitar work . \nfortunately this drowns out a lot of the dialogue . \nthe final exchange between henstridge and , er , cube though is both audible * and * priceless . \nmars has proven an infertile breeding ground for hollywood in the last year or so , what with the stillborn \" mission to mars \" and \" red planet \" ( with val kilmer ) . \n \" ghosts of mars \" sadly adds to those disappointing returns ( in its opening weekend it was overshadowed by a bunch of sequels , among them \" american pie 2 \" and \" rush hour 2 \" ) . \nthe irony is that the mars in carpenter's film feels sadly absent . \nthere are occasional references to the red planet , of course , but the film might as well have been set in perth amboys than on earth's closest neighbor . \ntwo things keep \" john carpenter's ghosts of mars \" from getting a huge slap upside the head . \n1 . \nhenstridge keeps her top on ( miraculously ) , and 2 . the film doesn't pretend to be anything it's not . \nwhat that means , however , is that fans of superior , intelligent , grade a sci-fi/horror are singularly out of luck . \n", "i'm really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone . \nsure , she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god's green earth ( second only to that movie critic at large guy ) , but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in , she always strikes out . \nthe crush was a slow-moving , predictable piece of fluff . \nhideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in . \nclueless was an annoying , unfunny waste of time . \nand people have e-mailed me too , saying clueless is a good movie and that i'm the only one who doesn't like it . \none girl said if i'd seen the movie with \" an open mind , \" i would have enjoyed it . \nnothing could be further from the truth . \ni went into the theater expecting to love the movie . \nthe preview looked good and of course i'm crazymadinlove with alicia , but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny , unlikable characters . \nalmost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way . \nwhen we were walking out of the theater , one guy ( and it wasn't me ) yelled out , \" that was the worst f$&#in' movie i've ever seen \" and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement . \nso last night i walked into the video store and saw alicia's pretty face on the cover of some made-for-video thriller called the babysitter . \ni knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion i'll probably never understand made me rent it anyway . \nwhat i got was 90 minutes of regret--the worst alicia silverstone movie ever . \nand you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like . \nwhere to begin in criticizing this movie ? \nthe plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier , the writing could have been done ( and for all we know it was ) by a ten year old , alicia is the star and she's still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever . \nthere is zero humor , zero suspense , zero drama and zero action , until the last ten minutes , when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence . \nzero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero . \nso why does this movie get one star out of me ? \nwell , alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub . \nand if it wasn't bubble bath , the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four- star features , but you settle for what you can get . \nalicia plays a babysitter who's spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party . \nand of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home ( at least that movie critic at large guy does ) . \nas the movie trods along , we discover she's not only the mostly-silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character's fantasies ( and probably every male viewer's too ) . \nthe drunken father thinks she's just the thing to recapture his lost youth , her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside , even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she's taking her bubble bath . \nthey even throw in the middle aged wife's fantasies about a male counterpart at the party . \nnot that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200+ pound woman in a black silk teddy . \nat least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg-rated . \nin fact , i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax late-night staple if not for the fact that there's absolutely no nudity in it . \nso you can't call it a sex flick . \ni've already pointed out that it can't fall under drama , comedy , thriller or action , so what do you classify the babysitter as ? \nbad . \n", "so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful sci-fi films such as close encounters of the third kind , 2001 : a space odyssey , apollo 13 and contact ? \nwell , whatever it is , you'd sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange , considering the disastrous results we're left with here . \nthis is a film that takes a little bit of everything , but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing ! \nit's like i said . . . this \nmovie sucks . \nplot : a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020 , after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet . \ncritique : extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie . \nuneven , would be another . \nthe trailer for this movie actually showed some promise , the buzz around it had been so-so , and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes , all leading you to believe that it's actually going to go \" somewhere \" . \nbut it isn't long before the entire movie downshifts into neutral , features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherry-colored planet , tries too hard to get us into the \" pain \" of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix . \nin a sci-fi movie ? \nwell , i don't know , much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and a half , only to figure out some big secret in the end , a secret which practically had me yawning with excitement . \nultimately , this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise , joins the crew in their \" misadventures in space \" for the main crux of its journey , and eventually settles down for one of the most anti-climactic endings this side of contact . \nmind you , if you enjoyed that film's shrug-of-the-shoulders ending , you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well . \nof course , i don't remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story . \nugh . \nwhat a friggin' mess . \nfilms like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again . \ndidn't anybody recognize the crappiness in this script ? \ndidn't they read the bad dialogue , the cheezy lines , the obvious derivative nature of the work ( mind you , with a director like depalma at the helm , that ain't saying much ! ) . \nof course , you can't really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry o'connell in this fine crew of thespians . \n'nuff said . \nneither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the film's musical score during the last fifteen minutes , presumably in order to wake the audience up ( okay , we get it brian , this scene is supposed to be powerful . . . wow . . . yawn . . . my \nears hurt ! ) . \nso is anything salvageable in this movie ? \nsure . \ngary sinise does another great job , as does cheadle , the film doesn't completely bore you as much as it just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening , and yes , the \" sand-twister \" effect that you see in the commercial is well done . \nother than that ? \ni guess i could say that i admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies . . . oops , \ndid i say \" admire \" , i meant \" am disgusted \" ! \nall in all , this movie delivers very little in actual substance , offers two-bit dialogue masked in a lot of sci-fi mumbo-jumbo , pretends to be deep when really it's just sappy , and eventually just settles into an ending which , other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story , gives us little more to think about than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck . \ngo see the ninth gate . . . now \nthere's a great movie ! \nand on a personal note , i think it's time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12-minute uninterrupted film sequences , and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting . \n", "the law of crowd pleasing romantic movies states that the two leads must end up together by film's end . \nif you're not familiar with this law , then maybe you've seen the trailer for this film which shows that the two leads are together by film's

definitely is not . \nmelissa joan hart ( from abc's \" sabrina , the teenage witch \" ) likes a hunky stud on the basketball team . \nadrien grenier is her grungy neighbor who's just broken up with

for some reason , but only after hart gives grenier a bath to turn him into a hunky stud . \nwill grenier like his new popularity and turn on his friends ? \nwill this crazy scheme work ? \ndo i care ? \nthe teen comedy resurgence of late has been surprisingly good in terms of comedy . \nwhat makes movies like can't hardly wait and 10 things i hate about you work ( and to a lesser extent , she's all that and never been kissed ) is because the writers of those films seem to realize that high school is a joke and write their scripts accordingly . \ni don't know what the writer's intention was with drive me crazy . \nthere was some smart comedy in those films to make the obvious endings worth getting to . \nhere there's nothing . . . \njust teens whining about who's going to take them to the big dance . \ndo me a favor kids , go get a job or something . . . \njust shut the hell up . \nin all honesty , the best part of this film is the end credits . \nnow normally when i say that it's followed with the joke \" . . . because the movie is finally over . \" \nin this case though the end credits really are the most entertaining part of the film . \nafter the obligatory second playing of britney spears' titular song , there's a quick commercial jingle for a burger joint the kids in the film hang out in and a brief rendition of the school song for their high school . \nnothing great , but more entertaining than anything in the 90 minutes which preceded them . \nsci-fi fans take note : there are brief appearances from stephen collins ( star trek : the motion picture ) and faye

entrance , however , is a grand one : out from the trees he leaps , gargantuan and imposing , sporting hands big enough to crush a volkswagen bug , and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have . \njoe bellows at the poachers before him , angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for millions of dollars . \nduring this scene , i turned to my friend and said , \" wow . \nthat's some ape . \" \njoe is quite a gorilla -- a big , digital gorilla . \nhe runs around the fields , chasing cars and people . \nhe picks things up and stares at them pensively . \nhe breaks things on accident , because he's just too big to avoid clumsiness . \njoe , as a special effect , is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes . \nas a character , he doesn't quite register . \nand the story he's been put in is as limp as they come . \nthe words \" family entertainment \" have never been a stamp of quality , but might joe young is just a silly special effects movie pretending to have a heart . \nthe picture is a remake of the 1949 film . \nit's mostly just about the big gorilla , but , strictly as a formality , the movie also has a few human characters . \nthe main one is jill young ( poor charlize theron , forced to waste her talent ) , a lover of gorillas . \nas a child , she witnessed a group of poachers murder her mother ; now , she lives in the jungle to protect the wildlife . \nspecifically , she's out to protect joe , a giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood . \nsoon , zoologist gregg o'hara ( bill paxton ) discovers joe ; he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser ( rade sherbedgia ) , who just happens to be the same guy who killed jill's mother . \nso , in an effort to save joe , jill and gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve , where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poachers . \nin addition , the space is way too small for him ( after all , he is a really big gorilla ) . \nand , to add to the complications , strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext ( he tells jill that he has a preserve big enough for joe ) , and joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jill's mother . \njill , of course , doesn't recognize strasser , even though he did kill her mother . \nthis is just one of the many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young , a film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with a special effects film . \nthe movie isn't really offensive -- it has some competent actors , a few nifty sets , and a lot of scenes with a big , digitized gorilla . \nbut the story is really dumb , there aren't any characters , and the film isn't satisfying on any level beyond its visuals . \nthe movie also has bad dialogue . \nif a critic says that a film has bad dialogue , it's only fair to quote some of it , but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like \" joe isn't happy ! \" \nand \" joe isn't safe here ! \" \n \" we need to get joe out of here ! \" \n \" joe is way too big for that cage ! \" \ni don't know if these phrases are word for word , but they're close . \nas i said , the characters here are only present as a formality : they do little more than state the obvious ( of * course * joe is too big for that cage ) . \npaxton and theron are talented performers who deserve to work on a script that provides characters for them . \nsadly , mighty joe young wastes them both . \nthere are a few clever moments ( although none of them are surfacing in my memory at the moment ) , and , as i said , the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes . \nit's certainly not a bad film for kids ; i doubt joe will give them nightmares . \nbut adults in the audience aren't likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla . \na big gorilla is only interesting for a little while ; after that , something needs to be done with the big gorilla . \nnobody ever figures out what to do with the big gorilla . \n", " \" spawn \" features good guys , bad guys , lots of fighting , bloody violence , a leather-clad machine gun chick , gooey , self-healing bullet holes , scatological humor and a man-eating monster . \nit not only appears to have been tailor made for a swarm of 12- and 13-year-old boys , it appears to have been made by them . \nin a classic example of telling and not showing , \" spawn \" opens with a truckload of mumbo jumbo about forces of darkness , forces of light and how \" men are the ones who create evil on earth . \" \nso much for a message . \nthe movie then lurches forward into the plight of al simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government assassin/operative who is murdered by diabolical boss jason wynn ( martin sheen , who plays all of his scenes like an oscar clip ) while on a top secret mission in a north korean biological weapons plant . \nsimmons goes to hell and back , after making a deal with satan himself -- if he agrees to command the devil's army to overtake the world , he'll be allowed to return to earth to see his wife wanda ( underused theresa randle ) and little girl cyan ( sydni beaudoin ) . \nof course , seeing as how five years has passed , wanda has fallen for -- and married -- simmons' partner ( d . b . \nsweeney ) . \nhis , uh , shoulder to cry on comes in the form of clown ( john leguizamo ) , a disgustingly disproportioned minion of satan's . \nclown manipulates simmons , now in superhuman spawn form , into a stand off with wynn . \nwynn , who thinks he is in league with the double-dealing clown , recognizes spawn as a threat and undergoes an operation where a bomb is placed on his heart -- when it stops beating , major cities around the world will detonate , causing the leak of a disease that \" makes the ebola virus look like a skin rash . \" \nphew . got all that ? \nit would be easy to dismiss \" spawn \" as just another one of those heavy-on-fx , short-on-substance action pics , but it doesn't even work on that level . \nthe computer-generated sequences are often and plenty , and the problem is that they look too computer-generated . \nthe several scenes set in hell present a devil that looks and acts like a video game graphic -- with the movie's healthy budget you'd think they could have afforded to make his mouth move when he talks . \nother elements of the movie are so-so ; spawn's enormous red , flowing cape is a wonderful sight , but it's too obvious when he's being played by a costumed actor or an image . \nin movies like \" contact , \" the special effects serve the story . \nin \" spawn , \" they are the story . \nand spawn himself isn't even an interesting character . \nthe film's reliance on razzle-dazzle would be acceptable if we were given somebody to root for , but both simmons and his funky alter-ego are completely underdeveloped . \nwhat we need is a batman , a luke skywalker . \neven watching the adventures of kleenex man would be more interesting than spawn . \npoor leguizamo . \nhe starred in february's \" the pest , \" a movie that i still think is the year's worst so far , although this one does give it a run for its money . \nas clown , he overacts to the extreme , never missing an opportunity for a poor-taste punchline . \nleguizamo farts green mist , munches a pizza slice covered with maggots and even dons a mini-skirt and performs a cheerleader routine , all before turning into a giant grey demon . \nthe guy was brilliant in \" to wong foo , thanks for everything ! \njulie newmar . \" \nwhat is he doing wasting his talent in this and \" the pest \" ? \ni'm one of the few people that liked \" batman & robin , \" this summer's other big-budget comic book film . \nyet after catching this movie and making the inevitable comparison , i can only hope people will change their minds and think of \" batman \" as the superior adaptation . \nthere's a compelling story somewhere in \" spawn \" -- including strong religious overtones and the debut of the first african-american superhero ever -- but it's just not found anywhere near here . \nas it is , \" spawn \" is just awful -- it stinks worse than a dead trout . \n", " \" in dreams \" might keep you awake at night , but not because of its creepy imagery , bizarre visual style or story about a clairvoyant madman who lures young girls to their untimely deaths . \nno , the source of potential sleeplessness here lies within the movie's brutally squandered potential , the least of which is an admittedly nifty premise - even by tired serial killer genre standards . \nthe big letdown , however , comes upon the realization that this 100-minute head-scratcher was masterminded by neil jordan , the man behind \" the crying game . \" \nhe's no stranger to cinematic weirdness , but this nutty nonsense really pushes the envelope . \nthings start out strong enough , with cinematographer darius khondji's stunning camera work guiding viewers into the bowels of a underwater ghost town during a creepy prologue that establishes a notably grim tone right off the bat . \nthis eerie opulence remains a dazzling display of showmanship throughout the entire film - there's even something macabre about the way khondji photographs a rustic , seemingly innocent new england autumn - but if there ever was a film that didn't deserve so good a polish , it's this one . \ndon't knock the look , but say what you will about the foolish plot , underdeveloped characters and flat dialogue . \nannette bening , another asset \" in dreams \" shouldn't be so lucky to boast , gives an increasingly effective performance in a role that doesn't do much for her in return . \nshe plays claire cooper , a massachusetts children's book illustrator who's plagued by terrifying nightmares involving kidnaped children . \nshe thinks these visions are a warning knell for horrible , soon-to-be-committed crimes , but neither her ho-hum husband ( aidan quinn ) nor the ho-hummer police can muster up the sense to take her seriously . \nthis being a thriller , we know that she is , in fact , on the money , and it's a credit to bening's acting that she delves equally into claire's madness and compassion . \nbut as soon as a body turns up and claire has given the authorities reason enough to believe her claims , \" in dreams \" trades in its nifty supernatural chills for a long series of allegedly spooky jolts that simply refuse to make sense . \nscenes pile up like a car wreck with little or no explanation or exposition . \nsubplots appear and disappear . \nwhen claire finally comes face-to-face with our evil murderer ( robert downey jr . ) , it turns out his name is vivian , he's clairvoyant and he's got some major issues with mama , a la norman bates . \n \" in dreams \" reaches its absurdist zenith here , and the climax drags with mumbled revelations and laughable twists . \nsome questions , then : what's with the garbage disposal retching applesauce ? \nare the drawings on the wall blood or paint ? \nwho cranked up the andrews sisters on the cd player and caused the swing to move on its own ? \nwhat about the computer ? \ndoes vivian possess the gift of telekinesis in addition to his other powers ? \nwhy would he continually endanger claire if she was necessary for his ultimate plan ? \nis the woman in australia integral to anything ? \nand the aforementioned flooded city - what function does that _really_ serve ? \nsigh . \nat least in my own dreams , i can imagine a better movie where certain talent didn't go to waste . \n", " \" knock off \" is exactly that : a cheap knock off of an action movie . \nit's also the worst movie i have seen thus far this year . \ni figured it would be at least a couple of months before i saw the worst film of 1998 , but alas , it has already been found . \njean-claude van damme stars as ( i think ) a designer jeans executive who discovers his half-brother has been supplying him with cheaper goods . \nrob schneider plays van damme's partner , and rochon plays . . . \nactually , i have no idea who rochon was supposed to be . \nshe just sort of popped up halfway through without an explanation as to why she was there . \nmany things are not explained in this film , but i do know that for some bizarre reason , van damme seemed to be doing a jackie chan impression throughout the flick . \nwhere chan comes off as endearing in his \" normal guy \" character seen in many of his films , van damme just comes off as a wimp . \nwe're never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions . \nto be more clear : i did not even know who he was supposed to be until about an hour into the movie , and even then , it was not made too clear . \nthe film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong . \ntsui hark ( who directed van damme's last movie , the bad , but not nearly as bad as this , \" double team \" ) never lets the camera rest for a second , and that's no exaggeration . \nwe are even treated to a five second shot from the point of view of van damme's foot entering a shoe . \nfabulous ! \nseriously , though , i have no problem with directors who want to play around with film conventions , as long as they don't get carried away . \nfor example , look at sam raimi . \n \" army of darkness \" , one of his best movies , features some of the most inventive camera work i have ever seen , but raimi never lets the special effects get in the way of story . \nthat's a concept that tsui can't seem to grasp . \nthe special effects and outrageous camera angles * rule * \" knock off \" to the point where the audience doesn't have a clue as to what's happening any more . \nanother problem with the film is that it looks cheap . \nthe film stock used is of such low caliber that i thought i was watching one of those chinese films shown really late at night . \nand for some inexplicable reason , everyone's voice seems to have been dubbed . \neven the stars . \nand even the special effects , seemingly the only aspect of the film the director actually cared about , are inconsistent . \nfor example , there is a scene in which van damme drives a car out of a window . \nthe car slams into the ground , and the left wheel is completely destroyed . \nseconds later , the car drives off at full speed . \nhey , i have no problem suspending my disbelief in an action movie , but a line must be drawn somewhere . \nfinally , the acting . \nnobody gives a good performance in this film . \nvan damme , an actor i usually like , is way off the mark playing \" everyman \" . \nand schneider , here to provide comic relief i assume , is totally unfunny and over acts his way through every scene . \neven the usually solid paul sorvino gives a terribly over-the-top performance as . . . \nonce again , i have no idea who he was supposed to be . \nin case i haven't yet made it clear enough , \" knock off \" is the worst movie of van damme's career and possibly the worst movie of the decade . \nand it's not even one of those movies that's so bad it's funny . \nit's too inept to be funny . \nthere are no redeeming factors in \" knock off \" and i seriously hope that every print of this film is burned to a crisp and that somehow my memory of watching the film can be erased . \n", " \" snake eyes \" is the most aggravating kind of movie : the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing . \nit's not just because this is a brian depalma film , and since he's a great director and one who's films are always greeted with at least some fanfare . \nand it's not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage and since he gives a brauvara performance , this film is hardly worth his talents . \nit's worse than that . \nit's aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more , could be totally intelligent , and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely . . . then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of half-assedness . \nor more deservedly , the hall of fame of the eighth-assedness . \nin certain circles , \" snake eyes \" was being advertised as a kind of modern day version of kurosawa's classic \" rashomon , \" where a crime is told from the four different ( and i mean different ) perspectives , and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening , which , i might add , is superb . \nin one very very very long steadicam shot , we meet the protagonist , crooked atlantic city detective , rick santoro ( cage ) , and follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife , interupts a pay-per-view event on tv , chases down a gambler , enters the arena all pumped up for the fight , sits down and talks with his bud , kevin dunne ( gary sinise , who's character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn , who's also in this ) , and watches as it happens . \nthere's a big name in the crowd , and that's the secretary of defense , charles kirkland ( joel fabiani ) , who's sitting behind rick , and who gets shot a second after the heavyweight champion , lincoln tyler ( stan shaw ) , is knocked out . \nthis all happens in the opening shot , and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction . \nwhat really happened , this film asks , and it sets this film up extremely well for when rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene . . . and \ndiscovers there's a very good possibility it was a conspiracy . \nas we follow rick trying to learn of more information , we also meet a woman who was talking to kirkland before he was shot ( carla gugino ) , and who flees the scene in a panic , and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casino/hotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness' takes on what happened . \nthis is all going pretty fine and dandy , and it's extremely interesting to watch . . . then \nit takes one wrong step . \nwe follow the wrong character , and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on , and way before rick can find it out . \nbut that's not the worst part of it : it's that it's the one person you didn't think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring , the one you didn't think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it . \nit only gets worse : the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film , and since we already know what happened , we can't rely on rick's investigation to be all that interesting . \nit's as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about a third of the way in , and decided to just fall back on an easy way out , and that just happens to mean that it has to become less and less credible . \nevents become more and more proposterous , and by the end , the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this : the deux ex machina . \nthat's where some outside intereference brings the film to a sudden conclusion and makes everything okay . \nthis time , it's a hurricane , an out-of-control police car , and a big round ball that adorned the arena . \nwhat went wrong ? \ndepalma and the screenwriter , david koepp , are extremely credible people in their respective fields , and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this . \ndepalma , who idolizes hitchcock to death , has done many a film like this , such as his masterpiece , \" blow out , \" where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece . \nbut granted , depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch , what with his over-the-top shot set-ups , notably the beginning and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel , forgetting anything about boundaries . \nat least his direction makes up partly for it . \nthen there's koepp , who showed such great ability at making a character's flaws come to life like he did in depalma's earlier \" carlito's way , \" a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well . \nhe can write a flawed character , but his rick santoro seems to be just a half-assed effort . \nhe's flawed , and we can see redemption if the story wasn't so formulaic . \na scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup . \nhe may as well have said the opposite of what he says ; it would have at least gone with what the character was like . \nthis is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity , because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption , then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way . \nas i was watching the first half hour , i couldn't wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed , how many different perspectives he'd be given , and perhaps he'd have to make a choice between who's he has to believe . \nnow there's a film . \nunfortunately , the film has two major deux ex machinas : one in the disasterous ending ; the other , about a half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes a stale and recycled piece of crap we've seen all too much before , but never from someone like depalma . \n", "forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects . \nset in 1692 at salem , massachusetts , the crucible opens with a group of teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around a boiling cauldron in the middle of a forest under the glow of a full moon . \nthey beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells . \nthen one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes . \nnot to be outdone in her quest to regain the attention of john proctor ( daniel day lewis ) , abigail ( winona ryder ) suddenly seizes a chicken , beats it against the ground and smears her face and lips with the fresh blood . \ntaking even adolescent hormone surges into account , surely this chicken-bashing bit is a bit excessive , especially for prim puritan sensibilities ? \nsurely to the puritan eye this is as close to a coven of witches as it gets ? \nthe crucible errs from the beginning and arthur miller's name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen adaptation of his play . \nthis is far from a harmless event , a bad start to an already shaky morality tale . \nthe play describes the film's opening scene during tense exchanges that makes one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply , and this adds to the play's charged atmosphere . \nin the film , the opening scene becomes an unintentional pandora's box . \nnot only is credulity stretched but abigail's obsession is unfortunately spotlighted . \nit positions the crucible more as a cautionary fable about obsessive and malevolent women than against witch hunts ; it will bring back the memory of a rabbit boiling away in a pot . \nnot surprisingly , the nighttime forest frenzy does not go unnoticed and when two girls fail to wake the following morning , witches are invoked by those eager to blame . \nwhen the girls are questioned , their confession of guilt is accompanied with an announcement of their return to god and they are thereafter converted to immaculate witnesses , led lustfully by abigail . \nwith alarming synchronicity our hormonally-advantaged girls zealously gesture and point accusing fingers at innocents , constant reminders that abigail's passion sets all this into inexorable motion . \nabigail seizes on this opportunity to rid herself of her rival for john proctor's love , his wife elizabeth ( joan allen ) , by including her among those accused of witchcraft . \nappropriately narrow-waisted and equipped with a distractingly white smile ( watch his teeth deteriorate much too quickly to a murky yellow ) , day lewis plays the dashing moral hero with an over-earnestness that longs to be watched . \ndirector nicholas hytner is guilty of encouraging day lewis' foaming-mouth fervour with shots where we stare up at proctor as if he was mounted on a pedestal for our admiration . \notherwise , hytner's direction is unremarkable . \nryder's performance as abigail is as consistent as her mood swings . \nher fits of frenzy are energetic enough but the quieter moments are less successful . \nabigail supposedly revels in her newfound power , but ryder fails at being convincingly haughty although there is much haughtiness to spare here . \npaul scofield is fine as the overzealous judge danforth , but the incessant moral posturings of all the characters along with the recurrent histrionics of the young girls pricks at the nerves . \nprobably because she is the only refuge of restraint amidst all the huffing and puffing , allen's elizabeth comes out as the most sympathetic character . \na scene near the end featuring a private conversation between the imprisoned elizabeth and john is undeniably powerful because for once we are given a reprieve from the moral bantering and the human consequences are revealed . \nunfortunately , when john's audience again increases to more than one his urge to pontificate returns and the human urgency of his situation is lost . \nit is clear that miller meant well but i do wish he did it with more delicacy and fewer diversions . \nhis screenplay is an imperfect creature with the distractions coming out as loud as the message . \nthe result is a clumsy muddle - i felt like the chicken from the opening scene , head ceaselessly banged with piousness too heavy-handed to be wholly believable . \nwhen the gallows beckoned , it was sweet release indeed . \nfar from bewitching , the crucible tests the patience . \n", "one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jean-luc godard film . \nafter all , he was a founding member of the highly influential french new wave . \nhe is also an esteemed film critic , lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing . \nhowever , his latest creation , in praise of love , is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year . \nthe abstract concept on which the film is based had merit , to dissect love into the following four categories : meeting , physical passion , quarrels , and reconciliation . \nthese four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples : young , adult , and elderly . \nit is edgar's ( bruno putzulu ) self-appointed task to capture these moments after a recent breakup , to define a central idea : \" it's only when things are over that they make sense . \" \nwhether this project will end up a play , film , or opera remains undecided . \nthe thesis is simple enough that , if played right , it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone . \ninstead what ensues is an hour and a half of repetitive vignettes , the next scene no more engaging than the last . \nonly once does any character utter something worthwhile , but by the time it happens you're so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it . \nbut don't fret , it will surface again . \nyou could easily sleep through whole sections of the film ( as some fellow critics did ) and wake up in a scene exactly like the one you nodded off in , not having missed anything worthwhile . \nbut you hold hope for some time . \nthe background music keeps you in a state of urgency , and even suspense , for the first few conversations . \nit's only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope . \nand with speeches like , \" i am thinking of something , but i can only think of that something when i am thinking of something else , \" how can you expect to hold anyone's interest ? \nto godard's credit , he certainly knows how to frame a scene . \nthe black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful . \nwatching edgar read while walking along a train track on a mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him . \nand if this film had anything poignant to say , you would have , which makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities . \nthe environments , be it city or country , are impeccably captured in crisp detail , but the script never complements them . \nunfortunately , godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to black numerous times within any given scene . \nsometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings , but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words . \nthe second half is composed of nauseating hyper-color that often blurs the image . \nyou suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners . \nthe only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies . \nsteven spielberg is picked on in particular . \nwhile i'll grant that this does happen , and i tend to shy away from watching such garbage , it's still a pointless focus for a film that purports to articulate the specific qualities of couplehood . \nit just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller . \nthe days of breathless are no more . \n", "america loves convenience . \nafter all , we're the culture that invented the cell phone , the 24-hour atm , and my most beloved , the remote control . \nyet perhaps this time , with ghosts of mars , we have taken our love of convenience to far . \nghosts of mars stars natasha henstridge as a tough as nails , pill-poppin' , martian cop , sent with her squadron to retrieve \" demolition \" williams ( ice cube ) from a remote mining town for trial back home . \nwhen she and her comrades , appropriately dubbed \" the commander , \" \" the rookies , \" and the guy with the cool accent discover the town's residents slaughtered , they are forced to team up with williams to escape from the remaining residents' head-chopping , alien-possessed clutches . \nfilled with a lovely overuse of storytelling flashbacks , flashes-sideways , and viewpoint changes , ghosts of mars is a hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and ill-conceived action sequences . \nthe only thing keeping this film from becoming an incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity of its story . \nripped straight from the pages of a 1970s zombie movie , ghosts leaps from one convenient moment to the next , stopping only to kill the characters which are most convenient to lose . \nattempts at character interaction and development are rare and forced . \nmost of these moments come off as kwik-e-mart wisdom , dispensed heartily around the slushee machine of life by the even-tempered streetwise hand of ice cube . \nwith a gun in one hand and a dynamite cap in the other , cube reminisces about his street life , comparing the zombie-stomping fun to \" me and my brother when we was kids . \" \napparently , crime in the bronx has gotten so bad that the residents have actually taken to ritually decapitating one another for entertainment . \nbut , even in the film's darkest moments , fate conveniently lends a hand , supplying heavily armored transportation and easily accessible rifles and dynamite . \nyes , in the future , man may travel to space and conquer mars , but nothing beats a good stick of tnt . \nand as we all know , every police station , past , present , or future , keeps a healthy supply on hand . \ncharacters die , heads are lopped off , but they were only supporting roles anyway , so why should we care ? \nas long as you have plenty of narcotics , immunity is guaranteed . \neventually though , even the most well-trained zombie alien gets a bit uppity and needs to be taught a lesson . \nwhat better way than by sacrificing a few minor characters to a convenient nuclear detonation , killing anything the machine guns can't handle . \nexplosions are fun . \nand even if the nukes don't get them , the conveniently placed dynamite packs on the train stolen from the set of the road warrior certainly will . \nin the end this film defines itself when our cop's tribunal pronounces , \" is that all you have to tell us ? \" \nfor , indeed , john carpenter has run out of things to say , and has instead decided to use whatever is convenient to tell a ridiculously bad story . \n", "reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlington rd are the others , each derivative in their own special way ) . \nthe guy can't seem to write believable dialogue ( sample from reindeer games : \" rule #1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel \" ) , create multi-faceted characters , or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns ( no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely ) . \nhis screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight . \ni can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard , \" oh you thought my movie was gonna go here , f * ck you jack ass , take that twist , decipher this mother f * cker ! \" \nit's almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie . \nand why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is ? \nauteur theory be damned ; it's kruger's \" style \" , not the director's that winds up on screen . \nkruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut \" sometimes less is more \" . \nand his numerous twists can't even claim to be originals ; arlington rd's ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j . pakula thriller the parallax view , and in reindeer games we get this ol' gem ; character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn't know ( pronouns used to protect the gender of the \" character \" . . . grammar \nbe damned ) . \n \" how did you know that ? \" \nthe stunned protagonist asks , suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along . \n . \n . \nsince twist endings are currently so in vogue , and seeing as how kruger's screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending , i guess it's no wonder why he works so frequently . \nhe's quickly becoming miramax's mickey mouse ; the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects . \nthis is appropriate considering that miramax ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports ( life is beautiful ) and freddie prinze jr . vehicles . \ntheir company's current logo could be \" we ride the trends \" . \nreindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy , a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head . \nalthough affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness , he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick . \naffleck is such a puppy dog that it's impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone's bitch . \nthe role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it ) , the twists so outrageous , and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent \" serious \" movie getting . \nit may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction , casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy ( who's played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance ) \njames frain is nick , rudy's cellmate , a manslaughterer who's found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason ( charlize theron ) . \nashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she's never seen one picture of him . \nwhich works out fine since the character is killed in a near-riot , and rudy ( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick ) takes his place , which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy ( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape ) and a surprise visit from ashley's brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) , who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co-horts . \nhe plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who , according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley , used to work as a guard in the indian casino . \nthough by the end , the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything i've described might as well be irrelevant . \nthis is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on ; several scenes in which , after catching his prey , the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid one-liner . \nincluded : two ( 2 ) scenes of two ( 2 ) different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him ( one following the other no less ) . \nthough it's an action film , the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on , incredulous as the audience . \nthe flick was directed by john frankenheimer , a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career , fell off the a-list following a string of flops and now , in his old age , is slowly climbing his way back up . \nit would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin ( one of those almost but not quite movies ) which followed the island of dr . morneau \n ( you remember , the one with marlon brando in mime make-up and a not so flattering moo-moo ) , and now this . \nhe films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain-zapped mtv audience to pick apart . \nproblem is these action scenes ( nearly all failed escapes ) serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play . \ncharacter problems abound ; rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre , the latter of which is not ( at least at this point ) something ben affleck is capable of pulling off . \nthe former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear . \nbut then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster . \ncharlize theron , an extraordinary talent , is , like affleck , playing whatever part the script requires her to play , whether it be vulnerability at one moment , anger at the next . \nshe never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes ( frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this . \ngary sinise has played this role frequently , and here , as in snake eyes , he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol ( the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more ) , that it becomes more of an annoyance ( oh there he goes again ? ? ? ) than a threat . \nthese are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience . \n", "a follow-up to disney's live-action \" 101 dalmatians \" that's better , more entertaining than the first ? \njust as unlikely . \nwith \" 102 dalmatians , \" the disney studios have proven that when it comes to going to the dogs , more is definitely * not * the merrier . \n1996's \" 101 dalmatians \" certainly wasn't the greatest movie-going experience of all time , but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous , larger-than-life performance . \nin addition , we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson , and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies . \nthis time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen , and close's facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the 53-year-old actress under that startling black and white wig of hers . \nbut that's only half the problem with kevin lima's laborious film . \nwhat makes \" 102 dalmatians \" such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor ( here almost single-handedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks he's a dog , voiced by eric idle ) , its rabid plotlessness ( cruella goes after puppies again ; winds up in goo again ) and most of all , the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic \" heroes \" of the piece , a welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blander-than-bland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo ? . \ngruffudd is cute and harmless , perhaps , but evans can't even aspire to that . \nthe dogs upstage them both , of course , but in the case of evans , even close's split ends are more animated . \nbad acting , however , seems to be a requirement for this sequel , since g ? rard depardieu shows up as a french furrier with a haircut like robert de niro's in \" men of honor . \" \njean pierre le pelt is a flamboyant fashion designer with a penchant for fine furs and depardieu's over-the-top antics mimic those of the campy close flail for flail , and wail for wail . \nfrance's most popular export besides brie has long since turned into a caricature of himself , and in \" 102 dalmatians \" the producers milk that realization for all it's worth--le pelt likes to refer to the furry little critters as \" poopies , \" par example ( and ad nauseum ) . \nthe finesses of the script ( attributed to four screenwriters no less , and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up ) are quickly dispensed with , since all it takes for a paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben ( ? ) . \nthat done , it's back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore off-limits sables and minks and a plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of a hooded designer gown . \nthe dogs are pretty cute--try making a puppy look otherwise--but that's pretty much all they are . \nthere's always the feeling that there's a trainer off in the wings , coaxing the dogs to open doors , or pick up their food bowls in unison , or pop a tape into the videocasette recorder . \nsavvy holiday goers should skip \" 102 dalmatians \" and pop the original 1961 animated classic into * their * vcrs instead . \nit's one dalmatian less , but 101% more satisfying . \n", "one-sided \" doom and gloom \" documentary about the possible annihilation of the human race as foretold by the bible . \norson welles narrates and appears in the film in which he , along with best-selling author hal lindsey , discusses various prophecies from the bible and relates them to recent ( well for 1976 anyway ) events . \nthe film is dated badly , as many things that are supposed to happen in the \" future \" never do . \nfor example , the planets of the solar system were supposed to line up in the year 1982 and cause chaos here on earth . \nwe're still here . \nthe arms race between the soviets and america was supposed to kick-off the apocalypse . \nwe're still here . \nsome of the more ludicrous moments come when it's alluded to that people like jimmy carter and henry kissinger may actually be the antichrist ( ! ) . \nalso , there's ten minutes of stock footage at the end of the film meant to give us an idea of what the battle for armageddon might be like . \nif it's anything like it's depicted as here then it's going to be incredibly boring . \nthe late great planet earth is available on dvd from vci home video . \nit contains the film in standard form ( aspect ratio of 1 . 33 : 1 ) , although some moments of stock footage are letterboxed . \nalso included are brief bios on orson welles and hal lindsey , as well as a trailer for another recent vci home video release , chariots of the gods . \naudio is mono dolby digital , and the video is fair to good for a film like this . \ni believe this is the first appearance of this film on any home video format so any condition at all is fine with me . \ncertainly i never expected a remastered print . \ncuriously , the menu screens on this dvd look nothing like the menu screens pictured on the back of the case . \nbut they're menu screens . . . \nso who really cares ? \n[pg] \n", "play it to the bone , the newest addition to ron shelton's sports - themed repertoire fails in numerous ways . \nlike most of shelton's other great films ( bull durham , white men can't jump ) , this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots . \nshelton's films are not considered sports films , but they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story . \nshelton has been so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races living in various different regions . \nplay it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull , but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse . \nthe film has no social message like its predecessors . \nthe relationship between the friends , two failed boxers who must face off against each other in the ring for 50 thousand dollars , is very confusing for a number of reasons . \nthe whole film , since it is primarily a \" buddy picture , \" depends on the strength of the friendship the two characters have for each other . \nunfortunately , it is a very weak bond for the reasons listed below . \n1 ) we never see how cesar ( antonio banderas ) and vince ( woody harrelson ) meet . \nthe two are so different from each other , that a scene of how this odd friendship developed should have been mandatory . \n2 ) vince and cesar argue every moment possible on their trip to las vegas . \nthere is not one convincing moment dedicated to seeing the characters laugh together or actually agree on something . \n3 ) the third character on the trip , grace ( lolita davidovich ) stands in the way . \nshe is in nearly every scene with them , making it impossible to understand the difficulty the two male characters are going to have when they fight each other . \n4 ) there are two many interfering , irrelevant side stories . \nvince is convinced that he sees jesus on a regular basis , cesar yells at the sky in spanish when he is angry , and grace tries to sell her inventions to hotel owner robert wagner . \nthese boring tales only hurt the central plot . \n5 ) when it comes to time for the two men to fight , they don't even hesitate to pound each other . \nwasn't the whole point of the road trip to show that these two are friends who could never hurt each other ? \nby the time the road trip part of the movie is over with , the film wants to be over . \nshelton , on the other hand , continues to tell his story . \nforty five painful minutes remain . \nthe boxing scene between cesar and vince starts out very powerful and interestingly different from other boxing movies . \nhowever , the fight goes on for way too long and becomes very repetitive and predictable after awhile , kind of like the whole film . \n", "some movies i should just skip . \nmy daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back , and here comes another disney effects-filled live-action flick based on an old tv program . \ntrue , the probgram is only 15 years old this time , and it's a cartoon . \nbut it's a cartoon i liked , and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen . \nbut my daughter really wanted to go , and how bad could it be ? \nturns out i was right , mostly . \ninspector gadget , oddly enough , follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian , down to the jive-talking side-kick . \nat first i thought it was done by the same people , but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin , where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver . \nthis odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it , where \" formula \" isn't just business , it's a way of life . \nthe producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits . \nin some parts you can just hear them saying \" more zany ! \ni want more zany here -- and -- here . \" \n \" let's have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here -- make it really painful . \ni want the audience squirming in their seats . \" \n \" ok , that's fine , but i want you to add bug guts . \" \n \" what does this scene do ? \ncharacter depth ? \nbut where's the zaniness ? \ni don't see zany here . \nif you can't make it zany , cut it ! \" \nthe latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie . \nmichelle ( who plays penny , gadget's niece ) shines in every scene she's in , but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time . \nmy guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor . \ndabney coleman's comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby . \ni kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film , but instead , he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes . \nhe is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the \" gidget bitch from hell \" town mayor . \noteri's overly enthusiastic and continually self-congratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland , oregon's own manic mayor vera katz that i had to wonder if the studio wasn't poking fun at our fair town . \nor , maybe all career politicians are like that . \ni must say , matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla . \nhe appears to have some fun with the film , especially as the evil gadget . \nrupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw . \njoely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself . \nher performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film . \nd . l . hughley plays the shuckin'-and-jivin' vehicular side-kick , in a role that firmly sets emancipation back 20 years . \nthe dialog is . . . let's face it , it's pretty bad . \nthe tag-line after a major set-piece battle is a faux pas that makes no sense in context . \na lot of the lines ( especially hughley's ) appear to be made up as they go along , by people with little gift for ad-lib . \nabout three-quarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw . \ngadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations ( not really \" battles \" ) with the evil gadget . \npenny does about a minute and a half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon . \nlet me rage here just for a minute . \nmichelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character . \nshe's utterly charming , and has excellent experience ( harriet the spy ) for the part of the pint-size detective . \nwhy she is so underutilized in this film is a real mystery . \nthe film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting ( or editing ) stupidity . \ninspector gadget is missing the long , long stretches of potty humor that ( among other things ) made my favorite martian so unbearable , but it's a very short movie , so perhaps something was cut at the last moment . \nprobably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits . \nthe \" evil sidekick support group \" is especially worth seeing , and has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds it's onscreen . \nall in all , another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action films . \ni wonder if disney uses the revenues for it's generally money-making cartoons to produce these losers . \nbut if true , why ? \nif they're trying for another mary poppins , they need to find a team that can produce one , and then give them a chance to do it . \n", "hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell . \nthe last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films . \nin a nutshell , the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous . \nwith the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership , a lot of hong kong's best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u . s . productions . \nsuch talents as jackie chan ( rush hour ) , chow yun-fat ( anna & the king , the corrupter ) and yuen woo-ping ( the matrix ) have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results . \nnow we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai . \nunfortunately \" romeo must die \" bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong's rhythms . \nthe film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking . \nenter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing ( russell wong ) . \nkai confronts po sing ( jon kit lee ) , the son of kai's boss and leader of the local chinese family . \na battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai , who handily kicks and punches his opponents down . \nit's not until club owner silk ( rapper dmx ) , bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends . \nthe following morning po sing is found dead . \nsuspicions escalate , as issac o'day ( delroy lindo ) is told of the murder . \nhis concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture . \nissac implores his chief of security , mac ( issiah washington ) to watch after his son and daughter . \nthe scene shifts to a prison in china , where han sing ( jet li ) learns of his brothers murder . \nhe fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined . \nhung upside down by one foot , han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work . \nescaping to the u . s . han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother's death . \n \" romeo must die \" is in many ways a fun film . \nit is both absurd and assured . \nthe basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes \" the godfather \" . \nthe relationship between jet li's han and aaliyah's trish o'day reminds us of abel ferrera's \" china girl \" , except that romeo must die's couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another . \ntheir romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history . \nthe performances are adequate if not fully acceptable . \nli , of course has the showiest part , having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination . \nallayah , in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace . \nit's obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic . \nbut , still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it . \ndelro lindo as issac o'day carries himself well in the film . \nan unsung and under appreciated actor , mr . lindo turns out the films best performance . \nthe other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d . b . woodside as issac's son , colin . \nthe performance is undirected , with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in . \nan unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and / or better written . \nfirst time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film . \nhaving a career as one of the industry's best cinematographers , bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots , and \" romeo must die \" does look good . \nbut the pacing of the film is lethargic , only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes . \nthe script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in . \nthe big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing . \nand of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayah's bodyguard , maurice has no comic timing whatsoever . \nthe best things about the film are its fight scenes . \njet li is a master of these intricate physical battles . \none needs only to see his film \" fist of legend \" to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat . \nhere , jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that \" lethal weapon 4 \" ( jet's u . s . debut ) didn't allow . \nunfortunately , a lot of jet's fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision . \nalso \" romeo must die \" must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film , and that is an x-ray effect that appears three times during the course of the film , showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent . \nobviously a homage to the famed x-ray scene from sonny chiba's \" streetfighter \" , the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film . \nit's as if the film has stopped and a video game has been inserted . \none problem though about the fight scenes . \nthose that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon . \nthey do have an internal rhythm to them . \na heartbeat , so to speak in their choreography . \nthe fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance . \nthis is created by the performance , the direction and the editing . \nhere in \" romeo must die \" , there is no staccato . \nevery fight scene , even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows a set pattern . \nthe rhythm is monotonous . \na hong kong film has a tempo that changes , heightening its emotional impact . \n'rmd' is limited to a standard 4/4 tempo , not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever . \na fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chan's films . . \nwatch the restaurant fight from the film \" rush hour \" and notice that the context of the fight , while technically amazing is rather flat ( the framing and cut always do not help ) . \nnow look at the warehouse fight from \" rumble in the bronx \" . \nthere you have a heartbeat , and emotional draw that doesn't let the audience catch its breath . \nthe stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly , causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted . \nhere in 'romeo must die' , the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl . \njet li is a grand and personable screen presence . \nit's a shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here . \none day filmmakers here in the u . s . will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such a commodity . \nuntil then , we'll be left with emotionally hollow product like \" the replacement killer \" and , currently \" romeo must die \" . \n", "i wish i could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion of a sports film . \ni bet it was some hotshot warner brothers agent with an dark armani suit and manicured fingernails saying , \" it would be a very light comedic version of any given sunday , and we could throw in the hoosiers angle with the casting of gene hackman as the tough but determined coach . \nthrow in that hunk of a guy keanu reeves and a cast of wacky characters and poof ! \nwe'll have a hit on our hands ! \" \nthe replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film , a mishmash collage of one-dimensional characters , rampant stereotypes of cultures and races , cliched emotional statements of purpose , and keanu reeves wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography . \nthe story is loosely based around the pro football players' strike in 1987 and a rag-tag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for a variety of teams with names like the washington sentinels . \nkeanu reeves stars as shane falco , a has-been football college player looking for redemption . \ngene hackman dons a fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in hoosiers . \nrounding out the cast includes swingers' jon favreau , 7-up pitchman orlando jones , gruff owner jack warden , and cast of wacky and unknown actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped characters : the drunken welshman , the overweight sumo wrestler , the black convict , the violent cop , and the dumb , dumb cheerleaders . \nthis bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays , gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is , keanu reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the football field , and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls from coyote ugly look like waitresses from denny's . \nthe usual things happen like clockwork . \nthe hero rises from the ashes of failure , the team comes together in unity , the hero falls in love with a conventional love interest , the football games are won with enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and clap , and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night movies on cinemax . \nit's also a shame when decent directors with good movies under their belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks . \nhoward deutch , who was behind the camera for two of the best films of '80s - pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful , has since been doing grumpier old men and caroline in the city episodes . \nobviously the problem is that without a good script , any director will fail in the end . \nsports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory , gritty tales involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds , the rise and fall of gallant heroes , and stories of dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life . \nthe replacements offers none of this . \n", "if you're into watching near on two hours of bored , foul-mouthed florida teens having sex , doing drugs , having sex , listening to eminem , having sex , playing video games , having sex , and killing one of their peers , then \" bully \" 's for you . \nbased on jim schutze's novelization of a true-life event , \" bully \" charts the story of a handful of disenchanted teenagers who , in 1993 , murdered their high school bully in cold , calculated blood . \nthe film could have provided fascinating insights into what turned these aimless kids into premeditated killers . \nin the hands of controversial director larry clark ( \" kids \" ) , however , it has less to say about its subject matter and more to say about the filmmaker's pornographic proclivities . \nin terms of the incident and what provoked it , \" bully \" stirs up nothing new . \nthe high schoolers are presented as a uniformly screwed up lot--bored with life , not much ambition , promiscuous , profane . \nthe bully in question , bobby kent ( nick stahl ) , is certainly an unpleasant piece of work but he doesn't exactly tower over his colleagues in the pathological department . \nhe hounds and harries and humiliates his \" best friend \" marty ( played by brad renfro ) and marty's girlfriend lisa ( rachel miner ) doesn't care for it at all and comes up with the idea of killing bobby . \nsimply remove him from the equation . \nmarty and lisa and a handful of their promiscuous , profane , and stoner friends , plus a recruited hit man ( ? ) , lure bobby to a swamp one night , stab him , beat him over the head with a baseball bat , and dump him into the canal where the sand crabs and the gators , presumably , finish him off . \nthere's no remorse--the next day they're talking about it as openly as a homework assignment . \nthey did it because they wanted to , and because they could . \nwhat's most troubling about the film , however , isn't the unsettling subject matter and the matter-of-fact way these young people go about eliminating one of their own but the way in which clark is constantly distracted by his own material . \nnot only is the nudity plentiful and graphic in \" bully \" but there's also an uneasy , exploitative feel to it . \ngratuitous crotch shots abound ( one of which makes the zipper cut-away in \" there's something about mary \" look like the height of subtlety ! ) . \nclark is so pre-occupied with his female ( predominantly ) leads that you forget , at times , what this movie is supposed to be about . \nthe stripping bare , literally and figuratively , of these actors ( who are , after all , playing underage teenagers ) becomes harder to watch over time , as you begin to feel for them and question the motives of the man behind the camera . \nthe conclusion of \" bully \" offers up literal snapshots of information about the sentences imposed on each of the protagonists for their involvement in the crime . \nit's a short sequence of stills--heather : 7 years ; ali : 40 years ; lisa : life imprisonment , for example--but it's infinitely more telling than the 110 minutes of rampant unpleasantness that precedes it . \n \" bully \" aims for truth , exploits it shamelessly , then bludgeons it to death . \n", "sean connery stars as a harvard law professor who heads back into the courtroom , by way of the everglades , to defend a young , educated black man ( blair underwood ) . \nthe guy is on death row for the murder of a white girl , and

\nthere's no logic at work here . \ntone is also an issue--there is none . \ndirector arne glimcher never establishes exactly what his film is trying to say . \nis it a statement on human rights ? \nis it a knock-off of silence of the lambs ? \nglimcher never tells . \ninstead , he forces his characters to jump through hoop after hoop , over drawbridge after drawbridge , hoping that the

one of the author's plays . \nthis year it's \" salome . \" \nfor about an hour , there's a sweet magic behind finney and his troupe of working-class stiffs . \nconflict arises , but it's small stuff--an administrator from the bus company here , an outraged catholic pork butcher ( michael gambon ) there . \nbut with finney at the wheel , so to speak , the film rolls smoothly over these plot points--just like the gorgeous leland double-decker bus in the story . \nwhere things get serious is toward the end of the film , when the plot takes a turn that the bus never would , and the story heads down a very dark alley that marks the end of an enjoyable ride . \nthe twist makes sense--and helps paint a complete picture of finney's character--but the trip to get there betrays the light , airy atmosphere of what had come before . \nit's not a fatal misstep , mind you , and it doesn't send the story soaring into the realms of incredulity . \nit's just a turn off . \ndr . strangelove 93

reason in the type of movies that made ginty the star . \nas director , ginty did very little to improve that impression . \nthe protagonist of the movie is jack ( played by jeff fahey ) , yacht skipper that falls madly in love with christina ford ( played by bo derek ) . \nhowever , she has relationship with rich and powerful jonathan ashby ( steven bauer ) . \none stormy night , the tragedy occurs and jack is accused of rape and murder . \nhowever , his good friend walter j . hill ( robert mitchum ) happens to be very good lawyer , so jack might even prove his innocence in the end . \nbelonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller , woman of desire distinguishes itself from similar films by having almost all characters behaving like total idiots . \nunfortunately , this film isn't comedy and any laugh is unintentional . \nthe characters are totally antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen to them . \nthe actors that play them don't help either . \nthat is especially the case with jeff fahey , whose jack is so stupid that even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like a genius in comparison . \nhis partner bo derek , on the other hand , shows that she didn't age enough to cease being the sex goddess , but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents . \nginty , on the other hand , tries to bring some life in the movie by using many flashbacks and strange angles of shooting , but in the end it gets only irritating to the already bored and dissatisfied viewer . \n", " \" lake placid \" marks yet another entry in the series of \" predator pics \" that were a screen staple in the late 1970s ( post- \" jaws \" ) and were revived recently by the godawful \" anaconda . \" \n \" placid \" claims to be a \" horror/comedy \" -it's directed by the same guy who did \" house \" -but its attempts at humor are actually less funny than deadpan seriousness of \" anaconda . \" \npaleontologist kelly scott ( bridget fonda ) is sent up to maine to examine a tooth removed from a body that had been bitten in half on the lake . \ndiscovering that the tooth belongs to a crocodile ( which shouldn't even be in this hemisphere ) , kelly goes croc-hunting with game warden jack wells ( bill pullman ) and sheriff hank keough ( brendan gleeson ) . \nthey're joined by an unwelcome guest , hector cyr ( oliver platt ) , a scholar who worships crocs and searches all over the world for them . \nalong the way , the merry band meets mrs . delores bickerman ( betty white ) , a weird old lady who lives out on the lake . \nyou know what to expect from this movie : lots of shots where the camera is the eyes of the predator ( croc cam ) swimming toward someone's dangling legs while \" jaws \" -like music plays , one character ( hector ) who's obsessed with the croc and stupidly endangers the rest , another character who insists that the predator can't possibly exist . \nunlike its slippery cousin \" anaconda , \" \" lake placid \" wants to present its formulaic plot tongue-in-cheek , which is self-defeating . \nthe result is neither scary nor funny ; it's just tedious . \nwhile director steve miner has several horror films on his resume ( including two installments of \" friday the 13th \" and \" halloween h20 \" ) , screenwriter david kelley ( best known as the creator of tv series like \" ally mcbeal \" and \" chicago hope \" ) doesn't seem to have the stomach for a chomp 'em up flick . \nthe body count is surprisingly low and doesn't include any of the major characters , and most annoyingly kelly and hector insist that they capture the crocodile alive rather than killing it . \n ( \" lake placid \" manages to have it both ways-i'll let you discover how for yourself ) . \nthe croc itself is mostly computer-generated , of course . \nlike the snake in \" anaconda , \" the thirty-foot monster crocodile doesn't seem real ; it moves too quickly and in ways that seem unnatural . \n \" lake placid \" also offers little explanation for why a giant crocodile is in maine . \nthere is a lot of semi-mystical mumbo jumbo about how \" we really don't know much about crocodiles . \" \nthey would have been better off going with something like the urban myth about alligators in the sewers . \na movie like this doesn't have to offer much of an explanation ( radioactive mutant ? \ncreature from outer space ? ) , but it does have to give the audience something to hang their disbelief on . \npullman and fonda seem to be plodding through the movie on auto-pilot . \nmost of the time , they're probably thinking about killing their agents or wondering if making this movie marks the end of their careers . \nplatt and white , on the other hand , seem to be giving their best efforts , and they manage to squeeze a few chuckles out of this sorry script . \n", "capsule : where are you tonight , leni rienfenstal ? \nstarship troopers is an expensive , hateful and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography -- and bad pornography , at that . \nit is not good cinema , not good storytelling , and not even stupid fun : it's so cynically , calculatedly bone-headed that even the least demanding members of the audience i was with were alternately bored and revulsed . \nit's one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time . \nwhy am i calling this movie pornography ? \npornography , in the abstract , is anything which is calculated to appeal to the baser instincts . \ni remember reading a review of full metal jacket which described the climact moment at the end of the movie , where private joker has to shoot the downed vc sniper , as \" a near-pornographic eternity \" . \ni didn't agree with that assessment , but i could see what was being implied : the reviewer felt as if the audience was being incited to stand up and pump their fists and shout \" do 'er , man , do 'er ! \" \nthat sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers . \nit's * literally * like a giant recruitment film that has gone berserk . \nit tries frantically to enlist our emotions but it winds up only being dull or sickening . \nthe film takes place in our future , when earth has come under attack by some alien species that doesn't appear to have intelligence . \nto counterattack , humankind does the single stupidest thing imaginable : instead of nuke the planet from orbit , which they're clearly capable of , they send down grunts with m-16 rifles . \nthis isn't heinlein , it's a bad wwii movie , one where all the most obvious points of satire are ever poked and prodded in combat scenes that are noisy , repetitive , and ultimately tiresome . \n ( one scene has a journalist on a battlefield , filimg soldiers being slaughtered , and ends with groaning predictability : said cameraman gets skewered , too . ) \nthe soldiers and their commanders are consistently idiotic . \nthey do not possess a germ of tactical intelligence or even common sense . \nthey don't even behave like soldiers in a bad * movie * , and therefore we don't care about them . \nwe hated the tom berenger character in platoon , but he * mattered * , and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate . \nhere , we don't even hate the bugs -- what's there to hate ? \nhating them would be like cursing a hurricaine . \nif there's anything really hateful there , the movie doesn't know how to give it to us . \nthe screenwriter ( ed neumeier -- perhaps a better appelation would be \" screen typist \" ) and director ( the increasingly talent-impaired paul verhoeven ) have not found any way to make the characters or the story serve each other . \none of the subplots concerns a woman pilot who's great at getting out of tight situations , and does it again and again and again . \nonce or twice is fine . \nby the fifth or sixth time , it's worn out its welcome . \nthere's never any sense that these people are really thinking their way out of anything , or really being tested to show their mettle . \nalso , the movie is irritatingly selective with how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponry . \nif a bug has one of the humans screaming in its grasp , then five guys can stand around it and blast away on full auto without doing a damned thing . \nbut if one human gets cornered , he lays waste to whole platoons of bugs with one clip . \nuh-huh . \nthe very worst feature of the movie is its repulsive quasi-fascist flavor . \ni say \" quasi- \" because while the movie uses many of the trappings of fascism ot eroticize its action -- the gear , the uniforms , etc . -- the movie doesn't have the nerve ( or the brains ) to be genuinely fascist , or intelligent about the subject . \nthe bumpers between scenes , which are apparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propaganda are propaganda -- just so clumsy and oafish that they wind up making the bugs look relatively innocuous in comparison . \nlike the rest of the movie . \nthere's more , i suppose , but it's not worth it . \nthe acting is bland , neither arsenic nor gravy ; the music disposable ; the camerawork turgid . \nthe heartbreaking thing is that it makes independence day look like a masterpiece . \n", "the classic story & the production which ruined it \nmarking the centennial anniversary of the 1896 h . g . wells classic , new line cinema , armed with a stellar cast and expert make-up effects man stan winston ( alien , predator , terminator etc ) churns out yet another hollywood film based on the classic novel . \nof course , the production is no doubt much more superior compared to the earlier 2 movies , one of which was made back in the 1933 and the other in the 1977 , under the title the island of lost souls ( sounds like a much better title . . ) . \nthe story begins with edward douglas ( thewlis ) , a un representative sent to oversee a peace treaty somewhere in the south pacific , who is saved from the brink of death by montgomery ( kilmer ) after his plane crashes into the sea . \ndouglas soon learns that montgomery is working for dr . moreau , who incidently , owns the island and also a reputable geneticist who has been awarded the nobel prize . \nhis host's reluctance to allow him to freely move around the island becomes clear when he stumbled into moreau's lab , when a monstrous birth was in progress . \neven worse , the other workers in the lab are not exactly normal \" people . \" \ndouglas stumbles across yet another shocking discovery when he is led to the beast-people community , which considers dr . moreau their maker . \nusing shock-therapy and the law , dr . moreau has long been able to keep his beast-people civilised to some extent but there are a few animal-men who are just too savage to be controlled . \nthe island of dr . \nmoreau questions the ability of men playing god . \ndr . moreau is a man obsessed with creating a race of beings which is free from hate and violence . . . but the savage within every beast is not something one can suppress for long . \nmoreau has no doubt a very interesting premise within its grasp . \neven so , the production has failed to make the most out of it . \nthere are too many characters to put your attention to and the worst thing is , the characters are not \" prioritized \" so when the audience is led to believe that a particular character is important , before they know it , he or she or it perishes . . . . rather \nungloriously at times too . \nperhaps there is some redemption in the development of the beast people , especially aissa ( balk ) , the most human of moreau's creations . \nthe two very important characters , montgomery and dr . moreau himself receive no development at all and it is in this area that the script fails miserably . \nmore screen time could have been used for character interaction and development . \ni really would have liked it better if , say , they delved more into dr . moreau's obsession , montgomery's purpose in the story and justification to as why the beast-people had to rebel . \nmaybe the nature of the screenplay , which incidently , does not incorporate much action sequences in the film , forced the filmmakers to \" cut a long story short \" and make it more of an action film than anything else ( it's still summer , and movies have to be \" marketable \" ) . \nthe special effects too , are really nothing for anyone to shout about . \nat most , i would say the beast-men looked just a bit more realistic than those apes in planet of the apes . \nthis h . g . wells classic really has potential to be a good film . \nunfortunately , after 2 adaptations , they still could not decide on how and what to focus their attention on to really bring out that important message which makes up the entire essence of the story . \nas a third outing , the island of dr . moreau \naccomplishes little and is nothing more than an inferior version of `the planet of the apes' . \nthe flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . \n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \n * * * * * perfection . \nsee it twice . \n", "lengthy and lousy are two words to describe the boring drama the english patient . \ngreat acting , music and cinematography were nice , but too many dull sub-plots and characters made the film hard to follow . \nralph fiennes ( strange days , schindler's list ) gives a gripping performance as count laszlo almasy , a victim of amnesia and horrible burns after world war ii in italy . \nthe story revolves around his past , in flashback form , making it even more confusing . \nanyway , he is taken in by hana ( juliette binoche , the horseman on the roof ) , a boring war-torn nurse . \nshe was never really made into anything , until she met an indian towards the end , developing yet another sub-plot . \ncount almasy begins to remember what happened to him as it is explained by a stranger ( willem dafoe , basquiat ) . \nhis love ( kirstin scott thomas , mission impossible ) was severely injured in a plane crash , and eventually died in a cave . \nhe returned to find her dead and was heart-broken . \nso he flew her dead body somewhere , but was shot down from the ground . \ndon't get the wrong idea , it may sound good and the trailer may be tempting , but good is the last thing this film is . \nmaybe if it were an hour less , it may have been tolerable , but 2 hours and 40 minutes of talking is too much to handle . \nthe only redeeming qualities about this film are the fine acting of fiennes and dafoe and the beautiful desert cinematography . \nother than these , the english patient is full of worthless scenes of boredom and wastes entirely too much film . \n , \n", "out of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in the limey , a cold , uninvolving , confusing new thriller . \nthough the plot description may at first seem like it came from the pen of elmore leonard ( author of out of sight , as well as jackie brown , get shorty and pulp fiction ) , after you watch it , you realize that it's not nearly good enough . \nin an aggressively non-linear fashion , the limey ( li * mey , noun : an english gentleman ) tells the story of wilson ( terrence stamp ) , a british ex-con just released from a 9 year stint in prison for armed robbery . \nhe has come to the us to seek vengeance for the death of his daughter jenny . \nhe doesn't know much about the circumstances of her demise , all he has is a name : terry valentine . \nvalentine was jenny's former boyfriend , a wealthy and corrupt record executive . \nhe's played by peter fonda , in his first major role since the terrific ulee's gold in 1997 . \nseeking valentine's reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy task for wilson . \nhe finally finds the impressive abode high in the mountains and sneaks in just as valentine is having a big party . \nhe winds up breaking his cover eventually , setting off valentine's head of security and valentine himself , who decides to run for it . \nwhat a mess . \ni have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by the linearity of time -- pulp fiction , which twisted time every which way , was a masterpiece -- but i do take exception to movies that decide to play around with it for no reason other than to confuse the viewer . \nthe limey does exactly that . \nthe plot is permeated with flashbacks , flash-forwards and what can only be described as random time-travel , without any evident purpose . \nthere is no method to this movie's madness . \nit uses a fancy way to tell a story that would be better off told more conventionally and more comprehendably . \nthe plot isn't particularly interesting in the first place : traditional , mildly hackneyed and not very involving . \nthis is a sort of brooding film -- our protagonist doesn't speak much and the action sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude . \ni felt like the director wasn't very interested in the proceedings himself , almost like he made this film for a paycheck . \nditto for the editing , which seems to be deliberately sloppy and unpleasant . \nsixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging criminal . \nhe's not much in the way of stature but he has a surprisingly imposing physical presence that works to his advantage here . \npeter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor : he's shy , quiet but always effective . \nhe's adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression : his feelings don't always show on his face by you can always tell what they are . \nthis is basically a conventional thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre fashion . \nwhy soderbergh couldn't just parrot down and tell a story , i don't know , but what he does do certainly doesn't work . \nthe result is a wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil -- even the action scenes don't work . \n1999 may have signified the death of the traditional act one - act two - act three storyline , but obviously some movies have not yet transcended it . \nshall we go back to basics ? \n", "a pseudo-intellectual film about the pseudo-intellectual world of art magazines , high art is as wasted as its drug-addled protagonists . \nin the only notable part of the movie , ally sheedy and radha mitchell deliver nice performances in the two leading roles , not that lisa cholodenko's script or direction makes you care much about either character . \nliving in a world of heroin induced highs , they float along until they fall in love with each other . \nthis uninviting picture , full of pretentious minor characters , has a receptionist that reads dostoevski and a woman in the restroom line who is a certified genius , having recently been awarded a prestigious mcarthur grant . \n24-year-old syd ( radha mitchell ) , who has a rather bland , live-in boyfriend , was just promoted to assistant editor at the artistic photography magazine \" frame .

episode , but becomes more commonplace than sleeping in the picture . \nsyd , who lives in the apartment below them , joins in on the fun and becomes a member of the zombie club . \nlucy seems pretty happy with her life of drugs , which apparently is funded by her mother . \nlucy quit working professionally 10 years ago since she thought she was being \" pigeonholed , \" and , since her mother has money , we can only assume that that's how lucy supports her habit and procures her living expenses . \na typical scene has the editors arguing about whether a potential photographer's work is transcendental or merely classical . \nthat no one has a clue as to the dogma they are spouting becomes obvious but not particularly funny . \n \" your work has a cultural currency that is important now , \" is the artist-speak that the frame's manager uses to convince lucy to show her pictures in the magazine . \nwhen the big scene comes in which lucy puts the moves on syd , her idea of a romantic line is , \" i want to get high with you . \" \nin lucy's world , sex and drugs come hand-in-hand . \nand the movie , except for the obligatory scene of someone almost overdosing , shows drug usage as being a hip and natural part of the art scene . \nthis vacuous picture throws in a standard downer ending in an attempt to manipulate our emotions . \nin another movie , it might have worked , but in this one the reaction is likely to be decidedly muted . \nhigh art runs 1 : 36 . \nit is rated r for explicit sex , pervasive drug use and language and is not appropriate for those younger than college age . \n", " \" party camp , \" is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies i've seen in awhile . \na late rip-off of the \" meatballs \" series , the film follows a group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk . \nthat's really about all that can be said about the \" plot \" because nothing much happens , except that the main character , wise-cracking jerry ( andrew ross ) , has the hots for a cute blonde ( kerry brennan ) , and there is a big contest in the climax . \nhow fun ! \nsince , \" party camp , \" has practically no screenplay and there is no talent at all involved , the least the makers could have done was make it raunchy and exploitative . \nit's not that i think exploitation is necessarily a good quality , but when you are talking about a dull turkey like this , the least that could have been done would be to fill it with a lot of mindless sex . \neven a psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick . \nat least , then , it wouldn't have been such a chore to sit through . \nnever before have i seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat . \nthe comedy was easy to spot , but it wasn't the least bit funny . \nit was groan-inducing . \nconstantly throghout , i was asking myself if director gary graver actually thought this movie was worth anything . \nso what saves , \" party camp , \" from the dreaded zero star rating ? \nwell , that's simple : jewel shepard , as a flighty bimbo , was admittedly fun to watch . \nalthough nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash , at

attraction for each other . \nwith advice from their roommates ( amanda detmer , jason biggs ) , ryan and jennifer attempt to discover the true meaning of their relationship . \nthe film definitely lives up to the dreaded three adjectives - and mindless entertainment is nowhere to be found . \ni could hardly sit through the 93 minute running time for several reasons . \nthe dialogue is probably the worst i have ever seen in any movie , mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring script and the ridiculous words these characters use is what hollywood thinks kids can relate to . \nit

subplots . \nand although this is supposed to be from both perspectives of the human sex , prinze jr's ryan dominates the screen while forlani's jennifer simply acts as a dilemma for him to work with . \nwe never learn anything about jennifer which is a shame too because forlani is the only actor to bring any life into her character . \nteenager or not : you'll hate this movie , i guarantee it .

rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood . \nultimately , however , paramount pictures , nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996's other , underperforming disaster films ( dante's peak , volcano ) , changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year . \nbut , to paraphrase the bard , swill , by any other name , would smell as rank . \nno number of name changes can help this picture . \nit's not just about a disaster , it is a disaster . \nhard rain is the case of a movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute . \nthe best shot occurs during the opening credits , as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg , indiana as the water level slowly rises . \nthe community , protected by an overworked dam , is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud-choked skies . \nfrom that moment on , it's all downhill . \nwhatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point . \nit takes forever to get to the end credits -- this is one of the longest-seeming 95-minute motion pictures i have recently endured . \nbasically , hard rain is one extended , dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot-outs . \nthere's a lot of water , broken glass , gunfire , and explosions . \nit's all very routine and uninteresting because there aren't any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense . \nthe film's conclusion is so preposterous that it's almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around . \naction films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards a conclusion . \ngraham yost , the writer of both speed and hard rain , surely understands that principle . \nunfortunately , neither he , nor cinematographer-turned-director mikael salomon ( a far off place ) , applies it . \nthe action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition . \nwe see the same kinds of things -- speedboat chases , flood damage , shoot-outs , etc . -- over and over again . \nthe movie constantly recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad the running time out to an acceptable movie length . \nthe storyline gives us a number of paper-thin characters in contrived circumstances . \nthere's tom ( christian slater ) , the one- dimensional action hero who works as a security guard driving an armored car full of cash . \nhe and his partner , charlie ( edward asner , tv's \" lou grant \" ) , get stuck on a street that's rapidly turning into a river . \na group of men , led by jimmy ( morgan freeman ) , arrive on the scene not as rescuers but as robbers . \nafter charlie is killed in a shoot-out , tom hides the money , then runs . \nas he swims and boats his way through huntingburg's roads , he encounters some of the locals : karen ( minnie driver ) , a would-be love interest ; a bickering old couple ( richard dysart and betty white ) , who are on hand to provide comic relief ; and the easily-corrupted sheriff ( randy quaid ) , whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives . \nthere isn't any real acting in this film . \nchristian slater utters a few lame one-liners and does a lot of mugging for the camera . \ntom is easily one of the most lifeless characters the actor has brought to the screen . \nrandy quaid sneers a lot , and is totally unconvincing . \nmorgan freeman and minnie driver both attempt to give legitimate performances , but they are defeated by the script . \nfreeman , one of the best cinematic thespians working today , looks suitably embarrassed to be here , but i suppose everyone needs a good paycheck from time-to-time . \nfollowing in the wake of twister , this is yet another natural disaster movie that doesn't trust nature's fury as the chief engine of conflict . \nas a result , we are saddled with an idiotic good guys/bad guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale could have had . \ntitanic proved that there can be a wealth of drama in a movie where everything goes under water . \nhard rain successfully demonstrates that the opposite is equally possible . \nthus far this year , hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem by fire ( firestorm ) and water ( hard rain ) . \nfortunately , there are only two elements left . \n", "instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoers will undoubtedly label as \" powerful \" or \" touching \" . \ni have a name for it myself : \" gross \" . \nthis is the sort of film where somebody stands up to a bully , the bully looks at the \" rebel \" threateningly , about to hurt him , and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too . \nhow that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me : aren't present day moviegoers beyond being \" inspired \" by something like that ? \nthis is one example ( there are actually some more in instinct alone ) of filmmakers insulting the audience's intelligence . \ninstinct's plot is brimming with potential : world-renowned anthropologist ethan powell ( anthony hopkins ) disappeared for two years whilst doing research in the jungles of africa . \nhe was found and is coming back to the united states a convicted killer ; he murdered to african policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him . \nafter committing a few more brutal acts of violence in the airport , the authorities stick him in a prison's \" psychotics ward \" . \nassigned to do an evaluation on powell is a bright ( or so we are told ) young psychiatrist theo caulder ( cuba gooding jr . ) . \ncaulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career . \nof course ( and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way ) he starts really caring for powell and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not a psychotic and that he should not be in prison . \nand then there's the inevitable \" heartless meanie \" character , in the form of donald sutherland who plays caulder's mentor . \nhe cares for caulder but does everything he can to discourage him from helping powell . \nlet's get one thing straight : dr . theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist i have ever seen , on screen or off . \nany good shrink will listen to what his patient has to say no matter the subject because any good shrink will learn a great deal about his patient that way . \nnot good old theo . \nno , he asks purposefully pointed questions and when powell dares to venture to another subject caulder says \" we need to talk about this right now . \" \nthis is a flaw only in the sense that it detracts from instinct's already dubious credibility ; unfortunately it's also the least of its problems . \ndirector jon turteltaub , who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon as well as the surprisingly above-par cool runnings decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that , contrary to what this movie's promotion would have you believe , it has much more in common with patch adams than with the silence of the lambs . \nit's not the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tears to your eyes ( what dreams may come aptly demonstrated that ) but the kind that brings vomit up your esophagus ( excuse the graphic depiction ) . \nit aims to \" inspire \" rather than to touch hearts . \nas yoda would say , inspire it does not . \nit is the ultimate sign of futility when a screenwriter ( the very experienced gerald di pego ) has to resort to literally telling the audience a movie's story . \nindeed , somewhere in the beginning of instinct , one of the characters actually reads aloud the film's plot to another character . \nthis , like the instance i mentioned in the first paragraph of this review , is a horrid insult to our intelligence . \ni am forced to wonder whether turteltaub and di pego did not think that we could figure out what instinct is about simply from regular conversation . \ni think that anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors , and he chews the scenery in this movie , brilliant as ever . \noscar winner cuba gooding jr . on the other hand is dreadful . \nhis performance is at least part of what makes his character seem so incapable of being a shrink . \ni liked the guy in jerry maguire as well as in as good as it gets but here he fails to project any shred of credibility or real feeling . \ni love animals , and instinct's prominent save the gorillas/live in harmony with nature theme is certainly something i could sympathize with . \nhowever this movie's execution is completely unacceptable . \ntone down the violence and this will be a chick flick . \n ? 1999 eugene novikov \n", "sydney lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality . \nhe is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades , like twelve angry men , serpico or the verdict . \nbut , in the same time , almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers that hamper lumet's reputation . \na stranger among us , 1992 rip-off of peter weir's witness , belongs to the latter category . \nthe heroine of this movie is emily eden ( melanie griffith ) , tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york . \nduring one of such actions , her partner nick ( jamey sheridan ) got hurt and as a result , she becomes depressed . \nin order to help her recover , bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community . \nemily starts investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder . \nconcluding that the perpetrator belongs to community , she decides to go undercover . \nthat isn't easy , because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways . \nthings get even more complicated when she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel ( eric thal ) . \nusing peter weir's formula isn't the greatest flaw of this film . \neven the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to the certain extent . \nbut the worst insult to viewer's audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith . \nthe author of this review never liked this actress very much , but she was at least tolerable in some of her roles . \nrole of emily eden , unfortunately , isn't one of them . \nfirst of all , she can't pass for tough nypd street fighter , and her attempt to pass for orthodox jewish woman isn't much better . \nscreenplay by robert j . avrech makes things even worse with some formulaic red herring subplots ( scene involving two italian gangsters was almost too painful to watch ) . \nbut , on the other hand , other actors are more convincing ( lee richardson as an old rabbi , thal as ariel and charming mia sara as his intended bride ) , and the photography by andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth when the scenes take place in hassidic community . \nalso , the film might educate viewers about hassidic culture . \nthat is the only thing that prevents it from turning into total waste of time . \n", " \" the world on land -- it's just too big for me . \" \nstarring tim roth , pruitt taylor vince , bill nunn , clarence williams iii . \nrated r . \nthe legend of 1900s is the year's most absurd movie , a rambling , nonsensical piece of seafaring garbage that goes nowhere fast . \nit stars thespian extraordinaire tim roth , looking wistful as ever , as a guy named . . . \n1900 . \nyou heard right . \nhis name is , in all actuality , 1900 . \nhe was born on an ocean liner on 1/1/1900 ( uh , hence the name ) , abandoned and adopted by danny , a ship crewman . \n1900 spends most of his early years hiding in the bowels of the ship because of danny's fear that he might be taken away from him because of \" visa matters . \" \nwell , when 1900 is about 9 or so , he starts wondering all around the ship . \none day , he discovers a grand piano . \nhe sits down and starts playing . \nmiraculously , what comes out is beautiful . \na group of onlookers gathers to watch this stunning prodigy make such amazing music at such a young age . \nwhen one of the people who knows 1900 tells him that his playing the piano like that without permission is \" totally against regulations \" 1900 replies \" f * ck the regulations ! \" \nho ho ho . \n1900 grows up never setting foot on dry land . \nwhen he's about 30ish and can play the piano like nobody's business , onboard comes another musician . \nhis name is max ( pruitt taylor vince ) and he plays the trumpet . \nafter 1900 catches max barfing everywhere during a storm , he sits him down on the piano next to him , takes the piano's braces off and plays while the piano flies all around the hall , taking them with it . \nhow the chair they're sitting on and the piano don't separate , i don't know , but this apparently isn't the kind of thing we're supposed to ask . \nafter that , 1900 and max become friends . \nmax is determined to get 1900 off the ship and discover what he is missing on land , but 1900 has no intention of doing so . \nwhat's more , he doesn't even want his music to go anywhere without him : when a record company hears about his talents , they come on board to make a record of his music , but after finding out that -- gasp ! \n-- they're going to make millions of copies , he breaks the record . \nthe conflict of the movie is that after max , unsuccessful in his endeavor to get 1900 off the ship , gets off himself , he stumbles upon a record of 1900's music in a store . \nthe record shouldn't exist because a ) 1900 never stepped on dry land and b ) the one record that was made on the ship was broken . \nladies and gentlemen , it's a mystery ! \nthe story itself is ludicrous and uninteresting and so are its elements . \nwe're supposed to be roused by a climactic . . . \npiano duel ? \nthere isn't anything in this movie with the potential to compel . \n1900 comes off as a whiny , brooding , extremely unlikable man : i can't recall a single word he said that was not some sort of depressing pseudo- meditation on life . \nditto for max , who doesn't seem to have a life outside his friendship with 1900 . \ntim roth plays 1900 with about as much panache as a fig leaf ; there's no spirit , no gusto to the character . \nhe insists that he leads a happy life on the ship , but to us he is dead . \npruitt taylor vince is a little more palatable , at least providing a moment of comic relief here and there to liven things up a bit . \nthe highlight of the movie would have to be the eminently amusing clarence williams the iii as the arrogant , leering \" king of jazz \" who challenges 1900 to the aforementioned piano duel . \nthe legend of 1900 was made by giuseppe tornatore , whose 1988 cinema paradiso is considered a masterpiece by many . \nthis effort is utterly limp and lifeless . \nat once ridiculous , boring , narrow-sighted and pointless , this is one movie that should be -- and will be -- quickly forgotten . \n", "my giant is two movies for the price of one , but neither is worth the cost of admission , even if you get in free . \nas lamely directed by michael lehmann , the picture tries to be a comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book . \n ( \" without goliath , david is just some punk throwing rocks . \" ) \nlanguidly paced throughout , the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer ( the omen ) meanders toward its sad ending . \nsince it's rarely funny or convincingly dramatic , what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains a mystery . \nother than a few nice visuals , there's nothing to recommend the picture . \nwith great film comedies under his belt from when harry met sally ? to the original city slickers , billy crystal has shown that he's more than the world's best oscar host . \nhe does , however , have a propensity for choosing hopeless material as in last year's father's day and this year's my giant . \none wonders if he reads the script before agreeing to go ahead with a project . \nsurely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there was nothing there . \nperhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success . \nor maybe he wants to be a dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious with the movie's somber tone . \nthe most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget they saw it by the next day . \nthis one-joke movie's single idea is to place real-life basketball player gheorghe muresan , who stands seven and a half feet tall , into as many visually striking situations as possible . \nsammy ( crystal ) , an agent currently without clients , is rescued after a car accident by a sweet romanian giant named max ( muresan ) . \nafter throwing out constant one-liners ( \" either god is in the salvage business or big foot just took my car . \" ) , \nsammy decides to get serious , seeing max as his meal ticket . \nand although he doesn't like it , he's willing to sign max up to do disgusting events like a wrestling match with a half-dozen dwarfs . \n ( the movie itself knows no bounds as it contains one of the most putrid and lengthy vomiting scenes ever . ) \nafter a series of missed opportunities , the comedic part of the movie is over , and it turns into a cheap and maudlin disease movie . \nwe learn that max's condition is terminal , and he will soon die . \nto be fair , the movie does contain a few good scenes - all of which you can see in the trailers . \nlet's hope billy gets himself a pair of reading glasses before he signs up for another movie . \nmy giant runs too long even at just 1 : 37 . \nit is rated pg for violence and profanity and would be acceptable for kids around ten and up . \nmy son jeffrey and his friend matthew , both 9 , gave the movie a single star and had nothing good to say about it . \nmatthew pointed out that it \" is not as good as it could have been or should have been . \" \n ( amen . ) \nhe went on to comment that he did not like the way the movie changed completely in the middle . \njeffrey complained particularly about how gross the movie was . \n", "talk about a movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters ! \nspice world is the feature film debut of the pre-fabricated pop band , the spice girls . \nit's intended as a sort of hard day's night , but ends up simply hard to watch . \nwhen watching the spice girls , i'm reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick ( such as from the smurfs , the snorks , or teenage mutant ninja turtles ) in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and a different name . \nthe spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles , and about as talented . \nthere's ginger ( geri halliwell ) , the brainy one , sporty ( melanie chisholm ) , the athletic one , baby ( emma bunton ) , the childish one , posh ( victoria adams ) , the fashion-conscious one , and scary ( melanie brown ) , the one with a tongue pierced back so far you're almost certain the post sticks out her throat . \nthe film itself doesn't really have a plot . \nit follows the girls as they travel here and there , culminating at their \" first live performance \" at albert hall . \nthe action , however , seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas . \nthe various misfires include : an alien encounter , a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls , the shooting of a spice girls documentary , a movie producer ( george wendt ) trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie ( nearly all of which , though incredibly far fetched , seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up ) , a meeting with a pregnant friend ( whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends ) , a boating adventure , a bus race , club-hopping ( wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd . . . even \nwhen they start to sing ) , and an assorted number of musical performances , press conferences , and general all-around celebrity stuff . \nwhew . \nfor some reason , the film is littered with star cameos . \nfrom elton john to elvis costello , from bob hoskins to meat loaf . \nheck , even roger moore shows up , though he can't decide if he's parodying himself as james bond , or if he's lobbying to be the reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld . \nrichard e . grant has the largest secondary part , a thankless role of the band's manager , clifford . \nthe celebrity spotting is partially amusing , and a decent way to pass the time when confronted with the rest of the film . \nneither amusing or spontaneous , when the spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring . \ntheir songs are alright , but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos . \nmy advice to fans is : stay home and watch that video collection , or at least spin that cd a couple of more times . . . either \noption will be more enjoyable than the film . \nnon-fans should know to stay well away from this one . \n", "this feature is like a double header , two sets of clich ? s for the price of one . \nnot only do we get the usual tired sports chestnuts , but the banal rich girl-poor boy love story is tossed in for good measure . \nan original moment in this loser is as rare as a chicago cubs world series appearance . \nthe screenplay by kevin falls and john gatins , based on a story by falls , merely lobs its plotline at the audience . \nthis is a story that needed sent down for seasoning and more coaching . \nsummer catch centers around ryan dunne ( freddie prinze jr . ) , a cape cod youth chosen to participate in the prestigious cape cod baseball league , supposedly a showcase for the best young amateur

own worst enemy . \nhe has the potential and the talent , but always seems to self-destruct at the crucial moment . \nso , ryan tries to remained focused on baseball . \nthen he meets tenley parrish ( jessica biel ) , daughter of one of the blue bloods whose lawn he manicures . \ntenley , a name only a hack screenwriter could invent , is unlike her snobbish counterparts and falls for ryan . \nif you can't figure out where all this nonsense leads , then you need a remedial course in film viewing . \nas always prinze is pretty to look at , but his performance mainly consists of facial expressions : puppy dog love , heartbreak , frustration , self-loathing or determination . \nbiel cries a lot , while bruce davison merely acts smarmy as her class-conscious father . \nthe only beacon is matthew lillard's fun-loving billy brubaker , the team's catcher . \nsummer catch borrows situations and stylings from other baseball movies , such as bull durham and the natural . \nno curve balls here , no sliders . \nevery pitch is predictable . \na blind umpire could call this movie . \nsummer catch is strictly rookie league moviemaking . \nit has as much chance of making the movie hall of fame as the dodgers have of moving back to brooklyn . \n", "one of the responses those that enjoy \" detroit rock city \" ( probably kiss fans , mostly ) might have upon first glance at the rating i've given the film might be something like : \" oh , that casey's gone and become a jaded critic on us . \njust what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n' roll movie like this ? \" \ni'm wondering the same thing . \ni feel like i should have had a grand time with \" detroit rock city . \" \nit's the sort of movie i wish i could've had a lot of fun with , but i didn't . \ni just didn't . \nsurely this film isn't trying to win any major awards , so should i have expected an oscar-caliber film ? \nno , but i expected something . \na funny joke . \na clever prank . \na plot development . \nanything . \nthe movie never delivers . \nyou've got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing . \n \" detroit rock city \" is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film's existence , and it's not a very satisfying realization . \nthe film is about four teenage boys , all huge kiss fans from cleveland , trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan . \nthat's it . \nthere is no big plot description in this review , because the movie has very little plot . \nthe characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giuseppe andrews ) , trip ( james debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington ) . \nthey have a garage band . \nthey're pathetic , like all garage bands , but they like kiss and they like rock n' roll , so i guess that means we root for them . \nthey have tickets , they lose them . \nthey get more tickets , they lose those too . \nthey come up with crazy schemes to get tickets , most of which backfire . \nthere's not much more to it . \nfrankly , it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film , when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys' hands , only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity . \noh , and jam ( real name jeremiah ) has a really , really annoying ultra-religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency . \nshe doesn't want them to see kiss , if you hadn't figured that out already . \nit's really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this . \nwe've got plenty of kiss , along with some ac/dc , ramones , and thin lizzy . \nthen again , \" maximum overdrive \" had an awesome soundtrack ( me being the big ac/dc fan that i am ) , but is probably one of the worst movies of all time . \n \" detroit rock city \" doesn't quite reach that level of ineptitude , but it gets dangerously close . \nin fact , the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind . \nbasically , the soundtrack has earned the film a full half-star , which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back ( except for marilyn manson , whose half-hearted cover of ac/dc's \" highway to hell \" sounds like something my neighbor's cat coughed up ) . \nit's also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste , because it' s evident that they're all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie . \nedward furlong has done far better work than this , and so has natasha lyonne , and so has lin shaye , but hey , they've got to make a living in hollywood . \npeople wanting to see kiss , and lots of it will probably be disappointed , considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song . \ntoo bad , they might have provided some energy to this mess . \ndirector adam rifkin knows he hasn't got much material to work with , so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning . \nwe get an endless parade of quick-cuts , split-screens , zoom-outs , zoom-ins , and rotating cameras , all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script . \nit's fun for a while , but eventually it becomes disorienting . \ni would recommend that those who felt seasick at \" the blair witch project \" stay far away from \" detroit rock city , \" because the witch has got nothing on this baby . \ni haven't felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since \" armageddon . \" \nand what about that script ? \nit's written by carl j . dupr ? , which sounds like as made-up a name as i've ever heard . \nif it is , i can't say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible . \na plotless , pointless rock n' roll movie can be fun , if the jokes and gags are actually funny . \nthe jokes in \" detroit rock city \" rarely are . \nin fact , the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana-laced pizza , and that was just because it was so surreal . \nthe rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it \" comedy . \" \nthere is no set-up , just a succession of punchlines that don't provide for much in the way of chuckles , precisely because there was no set-up . \nit's as if they just whacked someone on the head , pointed at him and said , \" see ? \nfunny ! \" \nlook , that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink . \nsee ? \nfunny ! \nlook , that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver . \ntwice . \nsee ? \nfunny ! \nlook , that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money . \nsee ? \nfunny ! \na word of advice to mr . dupr ? : no , these things aren't funny all by themselves . \nthey must be preceded by a clever set-up so the audience hasn 't predicted them five minutes in advance . \nthat's it , i've said enough about this movie . \nit's a waste of time and money . \ni liked the music , but don't bother buying the soundtrack . \ni hear it' s just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie . \nyou want to see this concept executed well ? \ngo rent roger corman's 1979 classic \" rock n' roll high school . \" \nit features another late-seventies rock band ( the ramones ) and a far more interesting story about a girl trying to get tickets to their show . \nyes , go rent that , and skip \" detroit rock city , \" which will probably bomb , and deservedly so . \n", "has it really been two decades since walter matthau coached the bad news bears ? \nnineteen years and two mighty ducks later , the formula is still going strong . \npolice academy graduate steve guttenberg stars as a small-town deputy sheriff corralled into co-coaching the school's hastily formed soccer team . \nhis partner-in-crime is the new british \" exchange teacher \" ( olivia d'abo ) , a lively lass who has obviously seen dangerous minds and knows that the best way to gain the respect of a disinterested , outer-city audience is to teach them something neat . \nlike soccer . \nmost of the good-natured gags are of the fast-motion variety , such as runaway cows and out-of-control lawnmowers . \nkids will laugh at the occasional belching bit , while their parents peacefully doze beside them . \nother than letting a supporting character named newt go unscathed , what's missing from the big green is a better integration of music and comedy . \ninstead of a peppy pop score , which would arguably work to better effect , most of the action is set to a bombastic orchestral score that belongs somewhere else . \ncomedy needs music . \njust watch any old bugs bunny short . \nthe marx brothers knew it . \nmel brooks knows it . \nunfortunately , the current trend is to \" overscore . \" \nlush strings and booming brass in every scene , at every moment . \nremember the simple strains of bizet's \" habanera \" in the original bad news bears ? \nthese days , it's usually a bellowing fanfare that threatens to smother every scene in its path . \nmuch like adding frosting to already frosted cake . \nan awfully big adventure ======================== \nthe reteaming of director mike newell and star hugh grant is about as far removed as you can get from the lightsome comedy of four weddings and a funeral . \ntheir second collaboration is a downbeat theatrical drama about a young intern ( georgina cates ) struggling to survive in post-w . w . ii \nliverpool . \nhugh plays the gay director , an * extremely * unappealing character who may alienate whatever fans are left after the nonsense of nine months . \nbleak make-up and

this film isn't nearly as gripping . \nwriter/director carl franklin ( one false move ) is the force behind this accomplished-but-stiff adaptation of walter mosley's crime novel . \ndenzel washington is as sturdy as ever , but he's burdened with a miscast supporting cast . \ntom sizemore and scene-stealer don cheadle are both fine . \nthe problems start with jennifer beales , who never registers

actor commands enough authority to stifle giggles . \njohn huston , we miss you ! \nfine period detail and a strong sense of humor are a plus . \nthey help to overcome a pace that's too polite for mosley's jazzy , swingin' story . \nsteal big , steal little ======================= \ni can't say much about this one . \ndirector andrew davis follows the fugitive with a wildly unfunny farce about twin brothers ( andy garcia ) with opposing moral codes . \nthey're fighting over their adoptive mother's estate , a 40 , 000-acre ranch worth millions and supporting dozens of migrant farm workers . \nso many different plots are trying to come together--feuding brothers , reconciling husbands , loan-shark hired hitmen--that you have to admire the director's ambition . \ntoo bad that almost every single person or plot-line is out of sync . \nthat is , with the exception of alan arkin . \nhe's the best thing in a movie that--despite the work of four credited writers-- * still * manages to waste such diverse talents as david odgen stiers , kevin mccarthy , and joe pantolinao . \nand what the heck does that title mean ? \n", "funny how your expectations can be defeated , and not in good ways . \nthe ghost and the darkness promised ( at least , it seemed to me to promise ) a hemingwayesque showdown between men and nature . \nwhat it delivered was mystery science theater 3000-level material

( val kilmer , whose irish accent comes and goes like an african zephyr ) is an engineer who has been hired to build a british railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda . \nhe is having immensely stereotypical problems : the natives are restless , his boss is a jerk , and now two man-eating lions are stalking the work camp and killing people off . \npatterson tries to handle the situation himself , incompetently , and then turns to charles remington ( michael douglas ) , a hunter of world reknown ( or something like that ) . \nthe movie stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions , they should have gotten top billing and co-starred with siegfried and roy . \nthey are nigh-invulnerable , as one comic book put it , and this is of course just the excuse the movie needs to have one native after another stepping forth to solmenly recite lines about the power of nature . \ngive me a break . \nthe movie hasn't got the wherewithal to even begin to exploit such ideas ; it's just trying to find convenient ways to stall us . \neven the lion hunts themselves are idiotic . \nget this : remington's big plan is to build a large scaffold-like structure in the middle of the savannah , sit on it , and wait for the lion to show up . \nhe does this , and then gets knocked off by a bird . \nby the end of the movie , the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open from me pounding my forehead with my hand . \nthe acting is forgettable . \ndouglas does a good job of portraying a relatively cracked fellow , but it's nothing he hasn't done before . \nkilmer looks like he wishes he were someone else , somewhere else , and the rest vanish into the cinematography . \nthe camera , by the way , sometimes behaves so stupidly all by itself that most of the lion attacks are incoherent . \nwhat did i expect from this movie ? \ni dunno . \nsome real excitement , i suppose . \na sense that there were formidable forces on both sides of this equation . \nno such luck . \ni

, baldwin ) is one tough cop , a guy who is being investigated by hardass fbi agents due to his association with the ny mafia . \non top of that problem , he has a drunk , gambling addicted partner ( penn ) who has a penchant for collecting parking tickets ( i guess cops aren't immune ? ) . \nthen , throw into the mix the femme fatale ( gershon ) . \nright there you have plenty of ammo for a decent cop drama . \nbut right in the middle of the film , they throw in a completely un-related plot point . \ndietl and his partner duke try to solve a case that they have been warned to stay away from . \nthe film spends over half an hour tracking the case of a nun who was beaten and raped to near death . \nonce the case is solved , the film shifts focus back to the mafia issue . \nwhatever neat mesh the screenwriter wanted to create between the two stories failed miserably . \naside from being asked to accept michael mcglone as a mafioso ( an insult if you ask me ) the performances were pretty good . \nbaldwin , though he occasionally slips into an impression of his brother alec , does a fine job as one tough cop . \npenn , who also slips into an impression of his brother sean , is even better as a loser tough guy cop . \nwhat one tough cop lacks is originality . \nthis film offers nothing new . \nnothing that you can't get from any cop film . \nit screams sidney lumet all over the place , perhaps because it was produced by marty and michael bregman , producers of lumet's dog day afternoon and serpico . \nbut even the masterful sidney would not have been able to make one tough cop into a good film . \ntoo much else is lacking . \ni also saw the boom mic pop into the top of the frame twice early on in the picture , something that i almost never notice . \nbut once i saw that , i had it in the back of my mind every time i saw a medium or long shot . \nat times , i was hoping to see it . \none tough cop isn't laughable , nor is it a terrible film , but it just isn't unique . \nit is a classic example of a film that didn't need to be made . \nbut one thing is for sure , it could really use a better title . \n", "supposedly based on a true story in which the

along with it . \ngee , i wonder if they get together in the end . \ni've seen more original stuff on the wb . \nand better stuff too . \npicture perfect also makes the mistake of being _wayyyyy_ too

the us-mexico border , expectation ran high for his next film . \nunfortunately , his men with guns is not the film anyone was hoping for . \nwe are essentially told in the first reel where the film is going to go and what it is going to do . \nthen the film does exactly what it promised , a painful as that is . \nthe plot of men with guns can be summarized \" in a central or south american

of his best students to go into the mountains and make the world a little better for the poor indios . \nfuentes believe the students to be up there doing humanitarian service . \nthen he discovers

mostly for comic relief , seem to know better than dr . fuentes that things have gotten pretty bad in the mountains . \nbut fuentes has to go from one scene of barbarity to another and discover how wrong he was . \nsayles certainly could have used 126 minute of screen time to tell us something more profound than that nasty things are happening down there and most of the worst happens to the unarmed civilians . \nthe cast is mostly unknowns to american audiences . \nfederico luppi is the good mexican actor who played the antique dealer torn by mysterious forces in cronos . \ndamian

in town is horny and sweaty . \nwe get the town from bad day at black rock , minus the train , plus busty women who can speak . \nlook at any schwarzenegger film , and you'll see our hero , bobby , as bobby has a mudhole stomped in his keister a dozen times , has his ribs stove in at least fifteen times , gets bit by a tarantula , gets shot at , and ends up with vultures circling overhead , all the while getting up like he just got a shaving nick . \nbobby as terminator ? \nstretch it a bit , and we have a five-finger discount from doc hollywood , where the whole story occurs because of car trouble , forcing the main character to stay at the mercy of the town and the mechanic . \nokay , he's working from a book , so maybe ollie's not totally to blame for blatantly copping these ideas . \ni just expect a man who can make up an alternative history of the united states to be able to craft a few original ideas before exposing the negative . \ni just wish he hadn't brought a cast like this together for what amounts to a group toe-stub . \nsean penn gives a great performance , and jennifer lopez and nick nolte are as on target as they can be , playing over-the-top caricatures of stereotype characters . \nthe best thing about the movie is watching penn react to the madness around him and try to figure out exactly what the blankety-blank is going on . \ntoo bad it's not fun to

\ni think i'd rather stare at a xeroxed envelope for two hours than try to figure out the tilt-o-whirl point of this loser film . \nplot twists are one thing , repetition is almost unforgivable , and this is dang near as unforgivable as any movie i've seen in the past five years . \noliver , i know your body of work is nothing to sniff at . \nyou've been nice enough to limit us to only one doors movie , and films like platoon , jfk , wall street and nixon give us plenty to dig on . \nyour scripts are certainly respectable , your budgets are up there on the screen , and your actors don't dog it . \nand i know that , maybe , with u-turn , you were just kicking back , just having fun . \nthat's fine . \nbut don't do that with a movie with the potential of this one . \ndo some police academy sequel ( imagine that . ) \ndo a big comedy , like a remake of it's a mad , mad , mad , mad world . \nbut do not drop a limp u-turn out of your pocket and expect us to accept it as \" an oliver stone movie , \" and not question why it stinks like week-old snook . \nthere's a right way to have fun , and a wrong way to have fun . \nthis was as wrong as you can get without going to jail . \n", "there are two things the american film industry should avoid at all costs . \none is letting an ambitious actor convert one of his or her favorite novels into a feature film . \ntwo is never greenlight a sci-fi film starring john travolta . \nto wit , we present the disaster that is battlefield earth . \na science-fiction opus starring the barbarino of the actors guild , battlefield earth should be shown only at maximum-security prisons when a prisoner is tossed in solitary for bad behavior . \nsci-fi is always a tricky beast : tight script , a good director , an ensemble cast of decent actors , and the ability to suspend even the most difficult of disbeliefs . \nbattlefield earth fails at achieving even one of these attributes . \nhere's the `plot . ' \nthe year is 3000 . \nmankind has been become an endangered species thanks to the conquest of a race of aliens called the psychlos ( sounds like either the latest clown act from cirque de soleil or a white rap group ) . \na small band of humans dwell in radioactive caves located in the rockies in fear of the `demons' who dwell in the cities below . \nthe psychlos are strip-mining the earth for its resources and terel , played by travolta , is the head of security for the mining/slave base located in denver . \na young rogue named jonnie goodboy tyler , played with dramatic flair by barry pepper , ventures from the safety of the caves into the city to uncover the truth about the `demons . ' \nhe is promptly captured and taken to the alien base . \nafter several attempts at escape , johnnie is placed in the middle of an underhanded subplot of terel's , involving circumventing gold from an exposed vein in the rockies to his own end . \njonnie , assumed leader of the mining slave group , then manages to attain all psychlo and human intelligence through a learning machine terel forces him to use . \nthen the story just runs along until jonnie teaches the rest of the humans the basics of trigonometry , the bill of rights , how to use a machine gun , and how to fly a harrier jet . \nthe whole mess concludes with a big , loud , obnoxious gun-and-plane battle that had me praying for the end credits . \nroger christian , the director of this lumbering beast , must have rented dune , blade runner , planet of the apes , independence day , stargate , beastmaster , the airwolf episodes , the `v' miniseries , the matrix , and the omega man . . . \nand decided to steal every scene he could for battlefield earth . \nchristian even shoots every scene in a weird dutch angle titled left or right for every frame of the movie ! \nand every scene in the movie ends with a middle wipe -- really . \nthe psychlos reminded me of a cross between jamaican basketball players with bad teeth and bloated hands and klingon extras working the star trek convention circuit . \ntravolta's acting hasn't been this bad since the experts or maybe perfect . \njonnie goodboy tyler evolves into william wallace with lines like `you can have your freedom if you fight ! ' \nthen there's the script : the film just never convinces you that the plight of jonnie in teaching his fellow humans to fight and `take back the planet' would be a difficult task to achieve . \nwhy ? \nbecause terel provides all the necessary tools to incite a revolt -- for no particular reason beside the fact that `humans are stupid . ' \nterel may be right , you know . \nhumans made this movie . \n", "would you believe -- in real life , i mean -- that if you were julia roberts , that you'd be the ugly underdog to your sister , the creepy catherine zeta-jones ? \nlet me tell you what reality is . \nreality is that you are megastar julia fricking roberts and your brother is eric roberts , and he picks up whatever crumbs of stardom fall off your coattails as you blaze across the sky in a golden chariot . \nthat's reality . \namerica's sweethearts is the opposite of reality , a train wreck that tries to sell julia as a scruffy also-ran , presumably because she wears horn-rimmed glasses and used to be overweight ( uh-huh ) . \nthe plot follows two married , mega-movie stars , gwen and eddie ( zeta-jones and poor , poor john cusack , whose material gets worse every year ) , on the eve of their new star vehicle's release , a film called time over time . \nthe only problem : gwen and eddie have gone through a nasty separation , and the press and public have not been forgiving ( think meg and dennis ) . \ngosh , and the director has vanished with the film , holding the only print hostage . \nveteran pr agent lee ( billy crystal ) is called upon to clean up the mess , throwing a press junket in the nevada desert to woo them with the story of a possible reconciliation between the gwen and eddie , presumably distracting the stupid , stupid film critics into forgetting they haven't seen the movie at all . \n ( note to sony : any studio executive that thinks this plot is going to win points with the reviewing press needs to check into rehab . ) \nand did i mention gwen's sister kiki ( roberts ) is along for the ride ? \nand that she and eddie just might fall in love along the way ? \noh billy , you're a scamp ! \nthe script you've co-written with peter tolan ( what planet are you from ? \nand bedazzled -- need i say more ? ) is a roast of hollywood and celebrity , sure , but it's not a funny one . \nyes , crystal tells us , hollywood is lying to our faces ! \nif you are surprised by this , you might want to check on your subscription to people magazine . \nit's about to expire . \naside from a scant few zingers ( yeah , se ? or winces rules ! ) , \namerica's sweethearts' jokes aren't funny , its pace is choppy , and the whole affair comes off as a vanity project -- not for headlining star julia roberts -- but for billy crystal to deliver a bunch of lame punch lines that he wrote himself . \ni didn't time it ( the movie's not that bad ) , but it's crystal who really has the most screen time and is the unequivocal focus of the film . \nbad move , billy -- your jokes suck . \nthe crotch humor is outpaced only by the meanness of the movie's gags -- and with unsubtle sexual innuendo dripping from every scene , how this movie earned a pg-13 rating is a mystery to me . \njulia overcame a lot of spiteful writing and acting to make my best friend's wedding into a winning film , but not even that 90-tooth smile can save her here . \nobviously aware of the ugliness before him , director joe roth turns to goofy supporting characters like hank azaria ( as a lisping spaniard ) , christopher walken ( the insane time over time director ) , and alan arkin ( a new age guru in a fright wig ) to crack wise . \nnone of the stereotypes is successful except for walken ; azaria comes off as a preening queen when he's supposed to be macho . \nas for roth , in case you don't know , went from direcing revenge of the nerds ii to launching his own movie studio , revolution , which produced this work . \nhe's back behind the camera for the first time in 11 years . \nit'll probably be another 11 before he's back again . \ni could drone on about how america's sweethearts will only appeal to the mouth-breathing morons who talk on their cell phones during the movies , but that would get old . \ninstead , i'll settle for discussing the movie's worst sin : that sweethearts is painfully contrived and wholly unbelievable , not just in its plot but in its sentiment . \nevery single character in this film ( with the arguable exception of kiki ) is simply hateful , and putting them in a romantic comedy is a waste of a bunch of villains . \nwhen you leave the theater , you'll ask yourself , too : why would i want any of these jerks to be happy ? \n", "rated : r for strong violence , language , drug use , nudity , and some sexuality . \nstarring : wesley snipes , anne archer , michael chaykin , donald sutherland , marie matiko . \nrunning time : 117 minutes \ndirected by : christian duguay \ni've never fully understood wesley snipes's career . \nhe has his ups and downs , but mostly the downs . \nhis best movie was one of the best of 1998 and that movie was entitled \" blade \" . \nhe has had his typical action movies , \" boiling point \" , \" passenger 57 \" , but his new movie \" the art of war \" should just be called \" rising sun 2 : the art of war \" cause basically it's a semi-remake of the same plot , with a different cast , and forced to be a ridiculously unbelievable thriller , that is high on style and low on substance . \nwesley snipes plays a james bondish type secret agent working for the u . n . after a chinese ambassador is killed , he is on the track of the killer , trying to find out who it is , how it happened , where the killer was , and what to do . \nanne archer plays his \" boss \" type person of the u . n . and she has hired snipes to track down the killer . \nwell snipes is mistakenly framed as the killer , and is now an outlaw , kidnapping a chinese woman with him , and having her help him along the way . \nall this leads to a finale that is so dumb , and so stupid that is it unbelievably dumb , and the stunts , dialogue and acting all ruin this movie . \nwesley snipes isn't one of my favorite actors because of the fact that the character he plays in every movie is the same character he plays in the movie before . \nthe only good role snipes has really had was in 1998's \" blade \" . \ni walked into \" the art of war \" expecting a good , high octane thriller , and all i got was a pile of mush . \nthe only real 'good' thing the movie has is action , and plenty of it , but i noticed it is badly filmed , the camera is so shaky you cannot even tell what is going on . \nthe ending finale is so worthless and pitiful , that it even tries to mock \" the matrix \" , laughably funny , it is undeniably stupid . \nchristian duguay's direction is also not that great . \nhis camera angles and sense of style are all in place , but sadly his lighting and editing are all badly done . \neven the whole \" matrix \" ending wasn't even good . \nthe stunts and action are badly filmed , and badly choreographed . \nhis placing of the characters , and the assination of the chinese ambassador , and the plotting of the movie are so predictable and laughable , that it just takes all the fun out of the entire movie . \nanne archer who is usually good in her roles , turns in a horrible job here . \nshe is sour , downbeat , and dreadfully dull with her forced dialogue , and dumb moves . \neven donald sutherland as a co-star can't save this movie from being a bust . \nso for an overall opinion : \" the art of war \" is a total waste of time . \nit's not entertaining , nor exciting , or even action packed . \nit is a pointless movie , and makes absolutely no sense at all . \nif you really want to see a good version of \" the art of war \" , rent the wesley snipes and sean connery action vehicle of the same kind \" rising sun \" , it isn't a great film either , but at least it's better than this . \n", "movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good , the bad , and the despicable . \ni originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in '95 , but i wanted to re-write it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics . \nwe need to be warned about some truly awful films , too . \nthis picture was so bad , it inspired the description for my 1/10 rating ( see ratings chart below ) . \nthe only thing saving it from a 0/10 rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno . \nso , it does indeed have some plusses . . . \nin fairness , elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff . \nand her ability to whine and irritate us , even while nude , was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone . \nthis character is not smart , not interesting , and ( deliberately ? ) \nfar too annoying far too often . \nlike in 1998s \" bulworth \" , when the movie was over i didn't care one little iota about the main character . \nat least warren beatty tried to make a statement with his dreary and overrated film , though . \n \" showgirls \" is too stupid to make a statement . \nsome people claim that the story is based on the legendary \" all about eve \" of all things ! \nif exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph l . mankiewicz was , he'd be . . . well , \nhe'd be a good screenwriter . \ninstead , this project may have sunk his career . \nhe wrote the ( ha ha ! ) \nscript and the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed . \nthe same team who created a good sex-film in 1992 ( \" basic instinct \" ) struck out here with their occasional violence , gratuitous x-rated sex scenes , and numerous ( and quite unnecessary ) lesbian overtones . \nthe predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as a dancer . \nafter the supposed street-smart young \" lady \" gets conned out of her suitcase by a slack-jawed yokel in the opening sequence , she befriends a tailor of the glamorous stage production at the \" stardust hotel \" . \nnomi doesn't take advantage of this contact to break into the big-time of dirty dancing right away . \nfirst , she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club . \nshe sells her hot little wares at \" the cheetah \" for a short time , turning on the fictitious customers and the actual theatre audience . \nhey , i never said she wasn't a hot number . . . \nmaybe it's that , her body , which gets her into the big-time when the star of the \" stardust hotel \" , crystal connors ( gina gershon ) stops into the strip club ( it certainly isn't her brains or pleasant disposition ! ) . \ncrystal requests a private lap dance for her boyfriend ( kyle maclachlan ) . \nhe also happens to be the pleasure-seeking worm who runs the big show . \ncrystal gets nomi onto the \" stardust \" team and , after an interminable amount of time , nomi \" earns \" the role of crystal's understudy . \nthe slut then deliberately injures and hospitalizes crystal . \nit was almost laughable that nomi had the guts to claim that she's \" not a whore \" . \nthat's a phrase we hear a few different times and it's completely ludicrous . \nof course she is ! \nshe sells her soul to make it big , but in the end we're supposed to believe that she's a better person than that . \nwe're supposed to root for her . \nno way ! \nshe's a tramp and a back-stabber who deserved nothing--least of all vindication in the . . . ahem . . . climax . \nshe is not a good person and they take over two hours to explain that the audience should think that she is . \nthe sub-plot with a male dancer ( glenn plummer ) who claims to see talent in nomi is just a gratuitous opportunity to let her dance naked a little bit more . \nit sure ain't character development ! \nplummer also appeared in \" speed \" in '94 in a smaller , yet better role . \nthis sub-plot goes absolutely nowhere except maybe to deliver an unsubtle hint that fornicators should practice birth control . \nkyle maclachlan must have been promised a big pay-day or his standards have dipped since appearing in \" blue velvet \" . \nthat picture was weird , but some critics claim it's one of the best movies of the '80s . \nnow ol' kyle can say that he acted in one of the worst of the '90s , too . \nhis sleazy character is important to \" showgirls \" , but we don't learn anything about him . \nhe uses people to get what he wants , but that only means that he fits in well with the other characters in this movie . \nis he a villain ? \nwho cares ! \nultimately , this movie is as tiresome as it is explicit . \neveryone must know by now about the soft-core acts of copulation , especially the riotous romp between berkley and maclachlan in his pool . \nwhat few reviewers take issue with is how mean-spirited this movie is . \neveryone's either having sex , exacting revenge , or wishing they were having sex or exacting revenge . \nit's just too hard to take ( especially for over two hours ) . \nif we must be exposed to the evils of the vegas world , why couldn't verhoeven have also made a point of highlighting the whispers , grunts , and other sounds during the dance numbers ? \nit's hard to care about these people if we can't even appreciate what they're capable of doing on-stage . \nberkley may have a future in hollywood because she can dance and she has a great body . \nafter all , the world of porn is still an active , dishonourable profession . \nperhaps berkley could join their ranks and leave the real acting to pauly shore and cindy crawford . \noops , they're bad actors , too . \nwell , at least , they're not selfish and contemptable like good ol' slutty nomi malone . \nuseless trivia--ironically , elizabeth berkley played virtuous and \" holier than thou \" jessie on the teeny-bopper tv show , \" saved by the bell \" , before breaking onto the big screen . \n", "mr . nice guy is the latest jackie chan film , so you should know what to expect . \na weak plot , terrible dialogue , very little acting ability , but some jaw-dropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile . \nhowever , mr . nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackie's best efforts , and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever . \njackie chan plays , who else , jackie . \nthis time out , he's a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show . \nnot that it ever makes a difference in the plot . \nthere are only two scenes of him cooking . \nfor the rest of the film , somehow he mutates into jackie chan , supercop . \nit never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills . . . perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege ? \na tv newswoman , diana ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) , covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo ( richard norton ) and a local gang of toughs , the demons . \nalthough she only has one camcorder , somehow the result is full of close-ups and multiple angles . . . hmmm , \nshades of broadcast news ? ? ? \nanyway , the goons discover diana , and will do anything to recover the tape . \nhere lies another crucial flaw in the story : doesn't anyone realize you can copy a tape ? \noh well , no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense . \nas luck would have it , diana runs across jackie , and , wouldn't you know it , jackie accidentally ends up with the tape . \nthis leads to countless chase and/or fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie . \nin a move apparently designed to woo american ( and other english-speaking ) audiences , the film uses english as its primary language . \nhowever , that doesn't mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackie's recent americanized releases . \nstrangely , many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english , and poorly too . \nwhether this is just a very bad case of looping , an effort to minimize accents , or a simple case of nostalgia , it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackie's dubbed films . \nthe plot in mr . nice guy is negligible , merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons . \nbut even though plots have always been second to the action in jackie's films , it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread . \nlook , if you have jackie chan playing a chef , why not use that to your advantage ? \nwatching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen , beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts . \nthe action is a mixed bag here . \nthere's really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackie's films . \nit takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site , apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan . \nthe action in the film is neither jackie's best nor worst , but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes . \nthe film's gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting . \nonce or twice , it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence . \nbut to slo-mo jackie running ? \neither this is a nod to the six-million dollar man , or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down . \nif you've seen all of jackie's films and are in need of another fix , go ahead and see mr . nice guy . \nhowever , if you're just in the mood for some good action , you'd be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work , such as supercop . \n", " \" first rule of fight club is , don't talk about fight club . \" \nthis quote deals directly with my opinion of this film , because quite frankly , it's not even worth mentioning . \ndirector david fincher ( seven ) has completely gone over the edge . \nwith crude humor , an intolerable script and 2 hours and 19 minutes of pure torture , i'm surprised i didn't walk out . \nthis just goes to show that hype kills . \nit's very rare that a film so hyped up as \" fight club \" turns out to be noteworthy , and this is no exception . \nthe story goes like this . \nedward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions , until he meets marla ( helena bonham carter ) . \nnorton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle , when he spots her at a session that he also attended . \napparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like , literally living in pain . \nwhy any person would think of such a thing is beyond me , but things do get worse . \nnorton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling , and it's on a plane that he meets tyler durden ( brad pitt ) . \nthe two men develop a bond , and go out to a bar , and by golly after they get drunk , the two pitiful characters fight . \nhow do they come up with this stuff ? \nanyway , their fighting catches other pathetic loser's attention , and a club is formed . \nout of all this mess , there manages to lie a message . \nfincher shows us that society is like robots . \nwe work in our jobs doing things step by step , and want out . \nour insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are , and we blame it on others . \ncall me crazy , but this is common knowledge . \ni think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is , which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably . \neven with two good actors , and a solid actress , they only manage to weaken the story . \ni couldn't help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp . \nit just shows how desperate the script is for attention . \ni guess brad pitt was right for this role , because i felt like beating him up myself . \nhis bothersome and depressing character , made me disgusted at his 20 million fee . \nit only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more . \nhelena bonham carter however really had no purpose . \nshe just popped up on screen , mumbled some lines , smoked and left . \nthis continues for what seems like 6 hours . \nthe film drags on and my headache gets bigger , while \" fight club \" nears what i think might be the end . \nunfortunately by then , the film hits rock bottom . \nthough the conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes , it backs down again and continues to move at a snails pace . \non a side note , the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film , that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer . \nfincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson . \nconcentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment , won't do any good if everything else is in need of support . \nalso , i'm afraid that immature men might respond to the film's violence . \nthe last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult . \nwhen the film ends , i'm just glad to get home and take some advil . \nyou'll either enjoy what the film has to offer , or agree with ed norton when he says \" this is so f * * * ing stupid . \" \n", "note to screenwriters and self : when you hit the big time , and the studios come knocking for those scripts that are sitting in your

absolutely nothing except look apple-cheek cute and gawk at wilson , her real-life boyfriend . \nbut the plot and the situations are so off-putting that nothing could save it . \nthis movie desperately wants to get mentioned in the same breath as the coen brothers , but home fries' brand of laboured hipness would be foreign to geniuses like ethan and joel . \nit's raising arizona without

the movie's framework , that dorian still lives with his mother and brother ) , and the scenes of murder ( attempted and otherwise ) , and what are you left with ? \nthe story of a single woman with child who works at a fast food joint ( but dreams of becoming a country singer ) . \nthat could turn out to be the most boring movie ever made , but it'd be better than home fries . \n", "the recent onslaught of film noir that has popped up in multiplexes , with everything ranging from \" l . a . confidential \" to \" palmetto \" to \" the big lebowski , \" has proved to be an artistic commodity for veteran , talented directors . \nwith this particular genre , directors are able to collate the sleazy underworld of the lower-class and the glamorous , opulent upper-class , while maintaining the noirish , ambiguous ambience , the staple of film noir . \n \" wild things \" could be classified as a black comedy , a sultry film noir or a plain ol' erotic thriller , but the one category it doesn't qualify for is that of a quality motion picture . \noveracted , overwrought and overlong , \" wild things \" is a confused mess , a movie that wants to have its cake and eat it too . \nwith its incalculable twists , turns , more twists and more turns , it soon becomes a tedious exercise in pointlessness . \nin spite of game efforts by kevin bacon and matt dillon , who manage to sustain straight faces throughout the ordeal , \" wild things \" not once jells in its eroticism , unpredictability , character motivation , sense of the world , plot , etc . there's not one redeeming quality in the picture that is not technical . \ndirected by john mcnaughton ( \" henry : portrait of a serial killer \" ) , \" wild things \" follows sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a hunkish , suburban florida high school teacher who's the dream of every spruced up female in the community . \nparticularly one . \nkelly van ryan ( denise richards ) adores him to such extent that she offers to wash his jeep with a partner . \nsoon , her tiny shorts are soaked and tells the other girl to take a hike , enabling her to come into his house . \nnext thing , she cries rape . \nand the so-called \" roller-coaster ride \" ensues . \na second accuser comes front , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , a booze-drinkin' , tattooed piece of trailer trash that charges lombardo of sexually molesting her , virtually guaranteeing a trial where preposterous confessions , asinine occurrences and laughable courtroom procedures are bound to happen . \neven bill murray gets into the act as lombardo's zany lawyer . \nhe wears a fake neck- brace , waves the finger at the other client and infuses the script with some billy murray . \nyou can tell mcnaughton knew he had nothing to lose assigning murray to this role . \nas ridiculous as it sounds , he's the most sane character in the movie . \nthe community is astonished . \nreporters flee to the scene . \nthere's an 8 . 5-million settlement for a libel suit against kelly's mother ( theresa russell ) . \nthere's the ambiguous cop ( kevin bacon , who also executive produced ) who sniffs something iffy in this concoction of deceit , murder and lust . \nwe , the audience , sniff something not so lustful . \nlike so many thrillers these days , including \" the usual suspects \" and \" the game , \" \" wild things \" eschews character for plot . \nmcnaughton knows how to handle the camera , and he keeps the campy fillings of the script flowing with workmanlike ease , as if he knows the territory he's covering is a harmless appetizer to accompany \" henry , \" a furious , unsettling film directorial tour- de-force . \ngeorge clinton's score is a delight to behold . \nbut it's the humans . \nthe characters are mere devices for the \" nasty \" twists . \nwhat writer stephen peters does not grasp is this becomes tediously uninvolving , almost unbearable , if those who inhibit this twisted world are not interesting , don't feel real or we don't care for them . \nnot even the unintentionally funny moments work . \nthe people in \" wild things \" are not so much people as they are caricatures . \nthen there's the erotic content , which nearly earned the film an nc-17 , for a sexless , badly edited , poorly lit menage-a-trois . \nand in what has to be one of the most flabbergastingly inept scenes that has graced this country , kevin bacon's member makes a cameo appearance with ten minutes to go . \nironically , the wildest elements of \" wild things \" are not wild at all . \n", "it rocks-actually , lots of rocks fly at us or from us , in slow or fast motion , at several points in the film . \nthey seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward , and when they land-once in a while , when we need a break from the space sequences-they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like . \n ( nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur . ) \nthey also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon , a steroid user's answer to deep impact . \nbruce willis stars as harry stamper , a famed oil-driller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond \" zero barrier \" and destroys our planet . \nwhy an oil driller ? \nthey require someone experience with deep-core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid . \n ( in one unintentionally ( ? ) \nhilarious sequence , nasa asks harry to inspect a deep-core driller they built based on his blueprints ; it is poorly constructed-harry criticizes almost every aspect of it . \nwe trust nasa to build space shuttles ? ) \nharry assembles the obligatory \" ragtag \" bunch of \" cowboys \" , including a blond guy , a fat guy , a black guy , a wiseass , and the man who is sleeping with his daughter ( affleck ) . \nonce they reach space , we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong-perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it ; i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes . \nwhether or not they save the day , i will not reveal . \nnor will you care . \ni will say this : you know you're in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope . \nwillis has barely a chance to come alive ; ditto for affleck . \ntheir big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act , in a last minute-and futile-attempt to inject warmth into the material . \nsteve buscemi's character-the wiseass-is exceptionally problematic . \n \" rockhound \" , as he's called , is sarcastic and foolish , so they tape him to a chair , where he spends most of the film . \nso why did they bring him up there to begin with ? \nrather , why write him into the film ? -give \nhis almost-witty one-liners to serious willis , who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies : at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter , firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig . \ni'm guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel , at least in my world where the sky is blue . \nliv tyler is pretty and humourless , as always ; suspiciously , four of her father's band's ( \" aerosmith \" ) songs grace the soundtrack . \ndirector michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick , like ketchup , eventually drowning the movie on-screen . \n ( the middle hour is a non-sensical , pyrotechnic assault on the average primate's brain . ) \nwhenever someone dies in this movie , a crew member inevitably yells out \" we lost ( insert dead person's last name here ) ! \" \ni must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil-guy-cum-astronaut from a live one , and close-ups of the corpses' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance , as their skin was often covered in fake blood . \narmageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla . \nit looks nicer , and has fewer plot-holes within its equally ludicrous framework . \nit has a vivid soundmix . \nbut at almost two-and-a-half hours , i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story . \nthe love story has been played up in the ads , perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic-fever . \nbollocks ! \nthe lovers in the film are miles apart throughout-erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car-sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon-crawler . \nremember a little film called jaws ? \nin this film , three independent-minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark . \nthey didn't much like each other at first ; eventually , they started to respect one another . \none of jaws' great scenes involved the would-be-ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories . \nthis is the sort of male-bonding foreign to bay or his producer , jerry bruckheimer , who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we'll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end . \nnot once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances-i'd be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before \" action \" was called . \na male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don't bare their souls , who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest-beating bravery . \nto this , i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic , nor brave , nor smart , even : this team couldn't build a birdhouse . \nand if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer-a trailer for a movie written by a team of body-builders and greeting card authors-i've never been a prouder wimp my whole life . \n", "there's a 1 , 000-foot tidal wave at the end of deep impact . \ni'd say it pretty accurately represents the towering flood of the last two years worth of disaster movies , which are getting more irwin allen- esque with every release . \nthe early wave of this revival , while just as cheesy and laughable , at least knew to include thrills every five to ten minutes . \ndeep impact tries to disguise itself as a human drama , with endless filler comprised of disaster prevention plans the country keeps taking . \nthe repeating cycle is as follows -- the president ( morgan freeman ) will go on tv and tell the country that there's a remote chance a comet will strike the earth , but that the nation's crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem . \nthen we get to see the plan in action , in some sequence utterly lacking suspense . \nthe mission will barely fail , and freeman will tell the country that the comet is still headed toward earth , and there's a remote chance it will strike , but that the nation's crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem . \nit goes on and on throughout the movie , but every time freeman goes on tv , we know his plan is going to fail . \nhow do we know this ? \nbecause we've seen the tv ads for deep impact , ads that feature freeman telling the nation that \" the comet is still headed right for us \" and show disaster shots of the comet striking earth and the giant tidal wave spreading . \nladies and gentlemen , that is the movie . \nsuccessful disaster movies have the main disaster toward the beginning and more little disasters that follow , but deep impact saves its one disaster for the end and discloses all in its 30-second tv spots . \ntelevision is what's wrong with deep impact . \nthe main character , played by tea leoni , is a low-level broadcast journalist for msnbc ( and that's the mere tip of the product-placement iceberg ) who stumbles upon a huge government conspiracy . \nshe thinks it's an instance of an ex-secretary of something or other ( james cromwell ) resigning because of a mistress , and that maybe he took the fall for the president in the same area . \nwhen she goes nosing around cromwell , he begs her to keep it under wraps . \n \" i know you're just a reporter , but you used to be a human being . \" \nshe figures out what's really going on after getting roughed up by some fbi men and doing an internet search , where all good journalists learn the difference between a mistress and an extinction- level comet . \nupon a top-secret meeting with president freeman , leoni agrees to keep the story under wraps until the president can hold a press conference , at which she gets to ask the first question . \nand everyone knows , if you get to ask the first question , baby you're a star . \nleoni ends up in the anchor chair , broadcasting every step of the comet's collision course with earth . \nand i'm sure it's comforting for her to know that , even though the world's ending in a matter of months , she's a cable news personality . \nso there she is , narrating the six-astronaut mission to blow the comet up . \nsuch personalities as robert duvall , jon favreau and blair underwood cash their paychecks and go through the motions of this dragged-out process . \nbut as anyone who's seen the commercials knows , the astronauts fail . \nthey only end up breaking the comet into two pieces , which means even more destruction to the earth . \nyeah , thanks , nasa . \nthat's when freeman has to come on tv for the last time and say goodbye to all the people who aren't picked to live in the missouri cave site for two years . \nthey even have animals , two by two , ready to climb into the cave . \nif the focus had been on people living inside these caves after the world had been destroyed , deep impact could have been a far more interesting movie . \ninstead we watch as a lovestruck elijah wood defies all odds to chase down his young wife , while people pack the highways out of town . \nthe reasoning is , of course , that if a comet is going to strike , they might as well be out in some scenic rural location . \nand , amusingly , the highway is spotted with people in u-haul trucks . \ni'm sure it's comforting to know that , even though the world's ending in a matter of minutes , the u-haul people are doing the most business of their lives . \n", " \" there will be another , \" the ads for this sequel proclaimed , and why not ? \ntrue , brandon lee is dead , but there would be no reason for him to appear in a followup to 1994's the crow , anyway . \nthe idea of spinning artist james o'barr's original comic book series into a sequel franchise revolves around the notion that a different startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie , taking its own righteous vengeance against the world . \ngiven that basic framework , the story could move in any number of directions . \nof course , it doesn't . \nstubbornly , the crow : city of angels backtracks to the beginning of the previous film , when lee's eric draven found himself drawn back out of his grave to do a charles bronson on the thugs who tortured him and his girlfriend to death . \ni remember the first film primarily as a harrowing exercise in brutality . \nin flashback , we see the most excruciating crimes exacted on eric and his lover , and then we watch in real-time as eric pays each perpetrator back in kind . \nit's loud and repetitive , true , a sadist's delight -- but it's also horrifying and fascinating . \ncity of angels gives us more of the same , but less skillfully . \nthere's an audience guaranteed for a film like this , although bad reviews and poor word-of-mouth will likely ensure that it won't be much of a success . \nin fact , miramax subsidiary dimension films was so fearful of the critical reaction to this picture that reviewers were shut out of advance screenings . \n ( i've never understood the reasoning behind this tactic , since good notices have never been key to the success of movies like the crow . ) \nso much for any confidence in the worthiness of their followup . \nthis time , ashe ( french-accented actor vincent perez ) is retrieved from his watery death ( he and his young son were shackled together , shot , and then thrown off a pier ) by the crow who serves as his link between the worlds of the living and the dead . \nperez might have some screen presence if he's given something to do with himself , but here he's simply thrown in front of the camera as a pretty face . \nat first , he's shivery and frightened , but he quickly recovers from the shock of his own death and becomes a badass biker from beyond the grave . \nhe's befriended by sarah ( mia kirshner ) , presumably an older version of the child who narrated the first film . \nkirshner , so beguiling in exotica , is here an exquisitely photographed blank . \ntattooed with angels' wings , sarah is just about as lovely as women come , but she serves no purpose , not even as seductress . \nthe gang of punks who killed ashe are ostensibly commanded by judah ( richard brooks ) , but a far more interesting choice as leader would have been iggy pop , who plays a gaunt fellow named curve . \niggy , all bones , veins , and drawl , is the only one who seems to have shared in the aesthetic of ruin that defines this film . \nlike all good things here , he's dispatched too soon and without much imagination . \nin the meantime , we're subjected to tedious glimpses of judah's compound , where bondage is the order of the day and hot wax is poured over naked bodies in s&m fantasies that would seem shy of the cutting edge even if they weren't distinctly secondhand . \neven the soundtrack is tired . \nmore than anything i've seen from hollywood lately , city of angels smacks baldly of product -- it's a movie with a lousy script but a great look . \ncritics have been quick to fault the direction of mtv veteran tim pope , but his work isn't that bad per se . \nhe's got a good eye , and some intriguing visual ideas -- if anything , this movie has a few too many scenes of ridiculously striking imagery . \nhis major stylistic failing is that he can't seem to direct an action scene , and the quick , nonsensical cutting that ensues is reminiscent of a low budget kung fu movie . \nbut as director , he must also shoulder the blame for the little screenplay that wasn't , the performers who couldn't , and an apparent lack of ideas on the parts of everyone involved . \nwho bought david s . goyer's anemic script , anyway ? \nthe producers of this crow were either too dim to realize their story was doomed to be a hollow rehash , or too cynical to figure their audience would know the difference . \n", "late in down to you , the lead female character ( julia stiles ) states her greatest fear is having an \" artificial conversation \" with her boyfriend ( freddie prinze jr . ) . \nthe irony of this statement will not be lost on audience members who have not yet walked out , fallen asleep , or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy . \nthe film is a multi-million dollar testament to everything artificial . \nfilled with characters , motivation , plot and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every step this is an unquestionable disaster . \nprinze plays a college student intent on playing the field until he falls for stiles' freshman co-ed . \nat first the movie seems to be an attempt to string along scenes with the sole purpose of out-doing the previous in how \" cute \" it can be . \nthe happy couple \" psychoanalyze \" each other ; they pick out a song because , as prinze's dj mother ( lucie arnez ) explains , every couple needs a song ; he smells her shampoo ; she scratches his chest in the morning to let him know she wants to make love . \nthen , in standard romantic comedy style , things fall apart . \nwhy ? \nwell , because they have to . \notherwise the couple can't make up and live ( presumably ) happily ever after . \ndown to you exists outside the realm of normal logic . \nscenes do not connect to each other and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism , but this is handled so poorly that everything comes off random and stupid instead . \na picnic scene involving the six key characters is just bizarre , not only for the stretched logic of these people hanging out together , or even knowing each other , but mostly because an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated to a goat . \nthe supporting characters are remarkably flat , and insultingly ridiculous as well . \nstiles' best friend ( rosario dawson ) is a pot head , prinze's roommate ( shawn hatosy ) is a girl crazy fool who can't meet women , and then there are the porn stars ( zak orth and selma blair ) . \nhe is one of those famous porn stars who is frequently interviewed on television , does the college lecture circuit , and stars in high budget costume epic porns that are shot on film . \nyou know , the average porn star . \nthe costume epic idea gives him a reason to appear in a different ridiculous outfit everytime he's on screen , the porn angle exists just so there can be a couple of stupid sex jokes . \nshe is a porn star mostly so we know she's slutty , so her very existence will make stiles jealous and prinze tempted . \nattempts at drama ( which means julia is going to cry ) include a pregnancy scare and the big break up . \nthese characters are so insipid only the most forgiving viewer would be manipulated by these weak scenes . \nwhat happened here ? \nthe cast is full of likable , promising , young actors ( stiles especially seems to be going places ) . \nwriter/director kris isacsson has simply given them material so weak not even seasoned pros could pull it off . \nin fact the whole film feels like a reworking of last year's extremely unpleasant the story of us , for teen audiences . \nthe direction is film-school-grad obvious . \nit's stylish in a hugely self conscious way which throws in split screen , a pointless parody of \" cops , \" characters walking into the flashbacks of other characters , and a hilariously cheesy airport meeting between prinze and stiles where all the extras move in fast motion while the couple moves in extreme slow motion . \nplus , the whole story is told flashback style , narrated by prinze and stiles directly addressing the camera . \nthis is the second film in a row ( following wing commander ) starring freddie prinze jr . which should have premiered on the aisles of the local blockbuster but was likely saved from that fate due to the fluke success of she's all that . \nif he doesn't start making better choices fast his future films won't be so lucky . \n", "for better or worse , the appearance of basic instinct in the movie marketplace gave the greenlight to a whole slew of overheated , oversexed , underwritten thrillers . \napparently not having joe eszterhas as the writer doesn't change a thing , since body of evidence wasn't written by him , but has a puzzling eszterhas-ish presence all over it . \nin other words , it's a ) really dirty and b ) really , really stupid . \nmadonna ( first warning sign ) stars in body of evidence as a woman who has piles of money and no apparent job ; she lives on a houseboat and likes to parade around semi-naked , presumably for the edification of the shrimp . \nshe's been accused of having murdered an older man who was her lover . \nalready two classic examples of hollywood sexism are in effect -- the first being that any woman in a movie cannot be sexual unless she's under thirty ( or at least looks it ) , and that they usually only exist for the sake of studs or filthy rich older men . \nwhat's worse is that the movie confirms all the above , and wallows in them as well . \nmadonna's character is accused of forcing sex on the old goat when she knew darned well he had a heart condition . \n ( and yes , there are the obligatory cracks from the cops about how at least he died happy . \nthis movie leave no scummy stone unturned . ) \nanyway . willem dafoe ( very good but completely wasted ) also stars as the lawyer who is doomed to run afoul of madonna's sexuality . \nhow do we know this ? \nbecause his character is set up with the token wife and kids . \nhow obvious is it that he's gonna cheat on her and have to fess everything up ? \nand get kicked out of the house ? \nand get welcomed back anyway ? \ndon't skip to the end yet ; we're just getting warmed up . \ndafoe and madonna have a lot of sex in this movie . \nmost of it is about as erotic as open-heart surgery , since it involves such goodies as hot candlewax ( always the kink of choice among screenwriters who don't know the first thing about * really * kinky sex ) and smashed light bulbs . \ndon't ask . \nanother thing that people are starting to realize about explicit sex in movies is that unless it is critically important to the story , it's insanely dull . \nwhat's worse is that body of evidence is dull * everywhere * , not just in the sex scenes . \nthe stuff in the courtroom is recycled ninth-hand from other bad courtroom drama scenes . \nthe thriller business itself is ridiculous -- it involves nasal spray bottles and drugs , and juergen prochnow as a surly doctor . \nand the ending -- another homage to eszterhas , maybe ? \n-- is one of those endings where you can almost see the exact * frame * where one of the five or six various endings to this mess was spliced in . \nthe director is uli edel , all the more disappointing since he also directed the elegiac and powerful last exit to brooklyn and christiane f . everyone has to eat , i guess , but this isn't a meal ticket , it's leftovers . \n", "it was with great anticipation that i sat down to view braveheart last week as it premiered on american cable . \nthe academy award winning film had been highly acclaimed . \nit also featured the music of one of my favorite film composers , james horner . \nwhat i was in for was a disappointing and overlong film which was anything but the best picture of 1995 . \nwhat drags braveheart down is its screenplay . \nit abounds with high production values : john toll's award-winning cinematography ( which also graced edward zwick's 1994 legends of the fall ) , a gorgeous score by horner , and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors were household names . \nbut this does not save a misguided script . \nthe film wishes to paint its central character as a hero , but the viewer's only response to his \" heroism \" is intellectual : william wallace ( producer-director mel gibson ) is fighting for freedom and against tyranny , so we have to root for him . \nbut wallace's actions paint a different story . \nhe speaks of freedom and acts of vengeance . \nthough one intellectually realizes wallace is on the right side , the film paints an unconvincing emotional portait , in which wallace is just not as bad as the english king . \nwallace speaks of freedom , but his acts point toward vengeance . \nafter kicking the english out of scotland , he decides to invade england . \nthis is evident of a \" spartacus complex \" , and this example applies both historically and cinematically . \nthe historical spartacus at one point moved from liberating slaves to sacking roman cities ; the film spartacus , like braveheart , has high production values and competent performaces and is dragged down by an awful screenplay . \nit is a shame that such an excellent score is part of such a terrible film . \nhorner's score tries to make emotional connection , but the performances and the script do not help . \ngibson portrays wallace in such a way that the audience cannot relate to him or identify with him . \nthis drags down any emotional connection to the film's plot , and turns three hours into a total waste of time . \n", "susan granger's review of \" the watcher \" ( universal ) \njust what we need : another lurid , trashy serial killer saga . \nthis time , keanu reeves plays an elusive homicidal maniac who engages in a gruesome ticking-clock cat-and-mouse game with james spader , a burnt-out fbi agent who has suffered a traumatic nervous breakdown after too many years on the job with the lapd . \nto taunt spader , who has relocated to chicago , reeves packs up his trusty piano wire and moves too . \nbefore long , he starts mailing photographs of the lonely , unsuspecting young women who are his intended windy city victims , challenging spader , along with the chicago police department , to stop him within 24 hours before he strikes again . \nin the midst of this murderous frenzy , there's spader's psychologist , played by marisa tomei , who is even less convincing as a medical professional than jennifer lopez in \" the cell . \" \nwriters david elliot , clay ayers and darcy meyers , along with first-time director joe charbanic ( helmer of music videos for reeves' band dogstar ) , dwell on the warped thrill of the methodology and the chase , revealing , early on , exactly whodunit since the killer says he and the cop \" need each other to give meaning to our lives . \" \nplus , as reeves explains , \" we're all stacked right on top of each other , but we don't notice each other any more . \" \nafter that , it's all sound effects and tricky camera-work , along with a muddled , discordant soundtrack . \njames spader's acting technique can be described as 'wooden deadpan' while keanu reeves maintains his perpetually monotone 'dude' persona which sometimes works , sometimes doesn't . \nchris ellis , as spader's self-important colleague , is the only cast member who manages to be convincing . \non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" the watcher \" is an appallingly awful , amateurish 2 . the real torture is watching it . \n", "ahh yes . \nthe teenage romance . \nan attractive young cast is pitted into an unlikely scenario that could only happen in the movies , and in the end , the guy always gets the girl . \nand with the arrival of the breakout hit `she's all that' last year ( followed by a long catalogue of imitators including `10 things i hate about you' and `drive me crazy' ) , the genre previously on life support is once again a hot commodity . \nalong now comes `down to you' . \nthe folks at miramax are obviously trying to capitalize on the rabid `she's all that' craze with their latest project , which has the studdly freddie prinze jr . attached and all . \nonly `down to you' doesn't have the ? unlikely scenario' mentioned above . \nit is an extraordinarily ordinary romance - a dull , unattractive teen comedy that sticks to the boring game plan that we're accustomed to . \nthis is the kind of romance that only giggly 12-year old girls will find convincing . \nin strictly textbook fashion , college sophomore and aspiring chef al ( prinze jr . ) meets freshman artist imogen ( julia stiles ) . \nthey hit it off like a couple can only in the movies . \nfrom here , it's the standard boy-meets-girl , boy-loses-girl , boy-drinks-entire-bottle-of-shampoo-and-may-or-may-not-get-girl-back story . \nthe plot is conveniently assembled to suit the requirements of the main characters , who are frequently taking part in activities that . . . . \nwell , only happen in the movies . \nfortunately , the cast of `down to you' has a certain appeal . \nfreddie prinze jr . and julia stiles are an adorable couple , and when on screen together , they radiate the sort of warmth and charisma that the movie should have centered around . \nzak orth , as the newly realized porn star monk , shows an unmistakable flair with handling all of the film's intelligent dialogue . \nrounding out the impressive ensemble of young talent are shawn hatosy ( `the faculty' ) , selma blair ( `cruel intentions' ) and ashton kutcher ( tv's `that 70's shows' ) . \neven the fonz himself - henry winkler , the epitome of teenage angst and nostalgia - has a welcome role as al's dad , the host of the popular cooking program `chef ray' . \nmaybe the concept of `down to you' looked good on paper to draw such a crowd . \nas a feature film , however , the finished product is bland and tasteless fluff with only an occasional whiff of cuteness to keep the gears from stopping entirely . \nperhaps worst of all , `down to you' is not funny . \nthe jokes are drawn from obvious sources and the resulting humor is banal and uninspired . \nthe characters on screen , often laughing at each other's goofy/embarrassing antics , seemed far more amused than the audience . \neven the giggly 12-year old girls had grown restless toward the end as they waited impatiently for the formula to run it's course . \nthe one mildly clever segment featured winkler and prinze jr . in a fantasy sequence called `cooks' , a `cops' take-off in which the father and son would storm houses and cook a decent meal for ? needy' families ( with the assistance of a fully-armed swat team , of course ) . \nwhen this is the highlight reel , you know the remaining film could leave something to be desired . \nin order to make a teen comedy work , you've got to have characters that show something by way of depth and identity . \n`10 things i hate about you' actually featured characters who were more than walking flashcards , and the result was refreshing . \nno such luck with `down to you' . \nit's just a textbook romance where , despite absurd circumstances , everything is bound to work out in the end . \nand at the end of the whole clich ? d ordeal , the nicest thing you could possibly say would be ` . . . . \nonly in the movies' . \n", " \" virus \" is the type of cliched , vacuous film that has been recylcled so many times before that you wonder why anyone would even bother putting work into making it . \nstrangely enough , on the same mid-january weekend last year , another film was released like this , \" deep rising , \" about an ugly monster on a cruise liner . \nprior movies with the almost exact same storyline include 1989's \" leviathan , \" 1989's \" deep star six , \" and all four \" alien \" pictures . \n \" virus , \" in comparison , is a servicable thriller , well-made and produced , but since it doesn't include one moment of even remote originality or intelligence , it sinks under the weight of the water that the film was shot on . \nbased on a series of comic books , \" virus \" concerns the crew of an ocean salvage tugboat , which becomes extremely damaged during a violent typhoon . \nafter discovering that the boat is slowly sinking , ( un ) lucky for them , a huge ocean vessel that appears to be dead in the water turns up within the confines of their radar screen . \nonce the team reaches the russian ship , they go on board to find that the place is seemingly deserted . \nafter turning the power back on , however , there gradually are signs that something else is on the ship , and the electrical equipment is oddly working by itself . \none survivor finally does turn up , nadia ( joanna pacula ) , who informs the suicidal and stern captain ( donald sutherland ) and one of the crew , kit foster ( jamie lee curtis ) , that a mysterious alien life form hit the santi mir space station which then was transported down to the ship , taking over the minds of all of the electrical machines and thinking that humans are viruses that should be completely wiped out . \nif \" virus \" sounds like all of the previously mentioned movies , you're correct . \nalthough the technical artistry is fairly impressive to bring the mechanical creature to life , the film itself doesn't appear to have a brain in its head . \nthe film sticks so close to the worn-out conventions of the \" creature \" genre that it is amazing anyone would spend the money and time filming it when they could be making an original film . \nthe actors are all very good and have all proven their acting abilities in the past , but they are sorely wasted here and do not really even have characters to play . \nin her second return to horror in the last year , jamie lee curtis once again proves to be a strong and resourceful heroine , but that is about it . \nalthough 1998's \" halloween : h20 \" was also a disappointment , at least she was given a few scenes to develop a character , unlike here . \ndonald sutherland has fallen on hard times recently by starring in thoroughly disposable films , such as 1994's \" the puppet masters , \" although i just watched him in the superb 1978 sci-fi classic \" invasion of the body snatchers , \" where he was fabulous . \nthe last of the three top-billers is william baldwin , but it is fairly hard to say if he is good or not in the picture , since he has nothing to do . \nbasically , \" virus \" is another one of those films where a group of people walk around and investigate a space ship/ocean liner/haunted house until the deadly and equally grotesque and slimy creature pops up and kills them one-by-one . \nit is not the worst of its type , but it is far from one of the best , and when exactly are studios going to give up recycling such shameless and overdone plot gimmicks such as this ? \nas long as some of them keep making money , i suspect the answer is never . \n", "over 40 years ago , a japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira , a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankind's nuclear testing . \npartly flight of fancy , partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry , gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo . \na year later , gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things : a new name , a dubbed english track , and raymond burr . \nas godzilla , the film took on the rest of the world . \nthirty years later , toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things ( yes , including raymond burr ) and called it godzilla 1985 . \nnow it's 14 years after toho's remake , and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run . \nin emmerich's godzilla , matthew broderick plays dr . niko tatopoulos , a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of a radiation-induced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms . \nwhen the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river , tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states . \nmeanwhile , tatopoulos's college girlfriend , audrey timmonds ( maria pitillo ) , works in new york city as an assistant to a big-time news reporter . \nshe'd like to be a reporter herself , and when godzilla comes ashore , she figures this is her big break . \nof course , with the big guy running amok in the city , niko and audrey are bound to cross paths , and are joined by victor \" animal \" palotti ( hank azaria ) , audrey's trusty cameraman friend , and phillipe roche ( jean reno ) , an operative for the french government , whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place . \ntogether they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla . \nwith the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nation's premiere movie production companies , one would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla . \nhe didn't . \nright up there with the lost world , godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history . \nthe plot is pretty much what we expect : the big dinosaur-like creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city , and it's up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped , while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down . \nthe script , however , is painfully bad . \nit's fraught with lines so corny , they don't even belong in b-movies , and includes many character actions which make you think , \" you idiot , \" or \" you stupid girl . \" \ni suppose when you've got a movie with a giant lizard loose in new york , any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well . \nwhy is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them , but is conveniently able to leap atop others ? \nwhy do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him , when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher and in a straight line ? \nwhy do sidewinder missiles , which have small explosive warheads , blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla ? \nwhy is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three f-18 fighter-bombers , when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two ? \nokay , maybe the last one was a bit nit-picky , but hey , i was on a roll . \nbroderick is usually a good actor , but in this film he's weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way . \nhank azaria does what he can , but don't expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage . \nlike broderick's , azaria's character is quite simply lacking in color . \nwhat really annoyed me was maria pitillo , who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting . \ncasting must have been asleep on this one . \nthe one bright spot here is jean reno , who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic , quite unlike what we've seem him do in the past . \nalthough his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster , reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable . \nunfortunately , the same cannot be said of the other incongruities . \nthe entire feel of the movie is tongue-in-cheek , and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it . \nthis results in a significant amount of parody , which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster , and ends up just producing a mess . \nmost of the characters seem to be there for comic relief , and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously . \nalthough emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture , what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens ? \nif we can't take the characters seriously , the threat they face is an empty one because we simply don't care what happens to them . \ngodzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film more light-hearted than it should be . \nfar be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters , but here's a behemoth running through the city ! \nthere's bound to be a lot of casualties , but instead godzilla is afflicted with the after-school g . i . \njoe cartoon syndrome , where almost everyone seems to get out of harm's way just in time . \nin a couple of scenes , godzilla briefly breathes fire . \nnone of the characters even remark upon this ability , nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers . \nit's as if the special effects people just wanted to show that yes , godzilla can do this , just like in the old movie . \nconsider another punch pulled . \nthrough creative script writing , you can make a sequel out of just about any movie , but the final scene in this one doesn't just leave the door open , it opens into a hallway leading directly into a room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently . \nit made me want to gag . \nemmerich should have done away with 90% of the humor and in-jokes and played this one as a straight action film . \nwith an intelligently written screenplay , godzilla could have been so much more . \nhowever , by confusing the viewer with a ton of add-ins and parodies , the movie ends up being something that just doesn't work . \nnow if they only had raymond burr . . . . \n", "before the remake of psycho appears , we've got to suffer through this remake of an earlier hitchcock film , dial m for murder . \nas usual , hollywood has filled it with glitz and big name stars , and it all amounts to a loud sounding nothing . \nthe film opens with emily ( paltrow ) and david ( viggo mortensen ) 'having fun' in an loft apartment . \nthe problem is , paltrow is married to stephen ( douglas ) , who is not too happy when he discovers this affair . \nif i was paltrow , though , i'd definitely go with mortensen . \nless wrinkles . \nanyhow , stephen approaches david with an interesting proposition : he'll pay him to kill his lovely wife . \nmortensen agrees , but the murder goes awry , and the twists keep on coming as the film progresses . \nunfortunately , the film dosen't progress very fast . \nin fact , it moves like a tortoise with arthritis ( read : very , very s-l-o-w . ) \nthe plot moves nowhere fast , and only becomes exciting in very short bursts . \nnot too good for a 'thriller . ' \nalso , the performances , apart from douglas , are below par . \npaltrow , showing immense talent in se7en ( 1995 ) and sliding doors ( 1997 ) is strangely stilted , even unconvincing , in this movie . \nmortensen is a little bit better , coming across as a younger douglas , but his role isn't meaty enough to show all his talent . \nwhich leaves douglas to waltz away with the film , which is does . \nhowever , i doubt douglas finds it very hard to play a stogie smoking , drinking womanizer with a creepy underside . \nalso popping up in the film is david suchet , playing a shifty looking detective . \nagain , it's not a character we're seeing on the screen , it's david suchet . \nthe director , who bought us the fugitive , piles on all the flash techniques , such as zoom-in's , quick cuts , etc . the lighting is also interesting . \nhowever , looks can't save this film from the depths of mediocre , and the film seemed to work better in a single set anyway . \nthe screenplay is o . k , but there's some hackneyed sub-plot about douglas being a ruthless player on wall street ( again ) and the ending is surprisingly stupid and cliched . \nthe characters also make incredibly dumb moves , especially paltrow , and stephen appears to lose all intelligence in the last reel . \nwith a combination of no tension , drama , or decent characters , a perfect murder is a failure all round , and an incredible disappointment . \nthere are a few bright moments , but they are far and few between . \nthe last thing a thriller should be is boring , and although the film just barely manages to keep your interest thanks to michael douglas , you wouldn't be missing anything if you decided not to watch a perfect murder . \noverall rating= \nreview by david wilcock ? 1998 \n \" you know , for kids \" - norville barnes \n", "coinciding with the emerging popularity of movies that deal with anything related to serial killers , relentless , 1989 low budget thriller about lapd detective sam dietz , played by character actor leo rossi , spawned three more sequels . \nrelentless 3 , third in the row , features sam dietz again , but this time detective , who had to catch vicious serial killer in his very first case , doesn't want to deal with similar line of work . \ndivorced , demoralised and transferred , he reluctantly returns to his old post when los angeles becomes a hunting ground for another serial killer , and evidence indicate connection with one of dietz's old cases . \nto make things even more interesting , it seems that the killer deliberately stages murders in order to bring dietz to the investigation . \nfans of the british tv films and mini-series like prime suspect or cracker would probably see a lot of similarities relentless series of movies . \nthey both feature vicious psychopathic killers , yet also give a lot of , usually depressive , details about chief investigator's private lives . \nthis one isn't an exception , but similarities with british television are only in content . \nthe execution and style is different , which makes this film mediocre piece of entertainment at best . \nuseless , gratuitous erotica also doesn't help either , obviously making this film longer than it should be . \nthe actors are good , though - leo rossi is fine as usual , and william forsythe plays one of more compelling villains in his career . \nsigny coleman as dietz's love interest , is , on the other hand , quite miscast . \nbut she won't have to worry about it in the future career , since relentless 3 wasn't supposed to be anybody's finest moment anyway . \n", "edward burns tackles his third picture with no looking back , and like his previous two , it is a working-class relationship picture . \nhowever , unlike his previous work , the film dwells on a more personal story , and with a female protagonist . \nand in no looking back , he stumbles , making a slow , boring film without the spark that enlivened his previous work . \nclaudia ( lauren holly ) is a small town waitress who is feeling stifled by her life . \nshe's at a turning point in her life , and feels as if she's going nowhere . \nher boyfriend , michael ( jon bon jovi ) , is broke and in a dead end job . \nif she were to marry him , she'd never get a chance to escape this town . \nenter charlie ( edward burns ) , claudia's old flame . \nhe skipped town several years before , without any explanations . . . even \nfor claudia . \nhe has come back to town to see her , and suddenly she is torn . \nshould she stay with stable michael , and never escape her hometown . . . or \nshould she ignore her instincts and fall for charlie again . \npart of the answer lies in the character of her mother ( blythe danner ) , who fell for the wrong man . . . and has spent her life pining for claudia's father to return . \nnow it seems that claudia is about to make the same mistakes . \nat only a little past ninety minutes , no looking back is rather short for its genre . \nunfortunately , it seems much much longer . \nthe storyline is simple and uninspired , and there's a lack of energy to the whole proceedings , which makes the entire drama rather tedious . \nedward burns makes a misstep by casting himself in the crucial role as the egomaniacal old flame . \nthere's no one to restrain his ego , which reigns unchecked . \nhe walks into the room and lauren holly swoons . . . yeah , \nright . \nlauren holly does what she can with her central character . \nbut we never understand why her character makes such pathetically bad decisions . . . and \nwe never really care . \nbon jovi is the only sympathetic character in the whole movie . \nhis acting talents are much greater than they might seem , but he is given a mostly bland and ineffective role to work with . \nthere's not much to recommend in no looking back . \nit's not that the film is bad . . . it's \nsimply boring . \nthere's no zest in any aspect of the film , and no reason to spend ninety minutes watching it . \n", "i don't expect much from eddie murphy these days . \nfor the past four years , the gods of cinema--or the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerates--have allowed him to make one bad movie after another . \nsuch films as metro , doctor dolittle , holy man , life , and bowfinger have reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washed-up hack performing as a studio puppet for 20th century fox and universal pictures . \nthe biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film , nutty professor ii : the klumps . \nthe klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump , an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places . \nsherman has just invented a new \" youth drink \" that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time . \njanet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor ( and for the most ridiculous reasons ) . \nwith love on his mind , sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego , buddy love from the first professor , who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers . \nwith some convoluted mumbo-jumbo about dna extraction , sherman extracts the \" buddy love \" link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into a handy-dandy lab beaker . \nbut one night , the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated . . . \nbecause every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy . \nthen the klump family , all played by eddie murphy , step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex , flabby breasts , a slew of fart and dick jokes , and enough fat people jokes that i lost count after the first thirty minutes . \nand did i mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster ? \nthe movie finally dissolves into a really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world -- with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene . \npure and simple , the klumps is a failure . \nits script was handled by not one but five screenwriters , and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes . \nany sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process . \nit's more discerning to learn that chris weitz and paul weitz , the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade , american pie , have their names stamped to this trash . \nhey guys - quick note - keep this movie off of your resumes . \nthe characterization of sherman's family , the klumps , is one of the most ignorant stereotypes of a black family i have ever seen in cinema . \neveryone member of the family is a large person who wipes the bins clean at a local buffet restaurant like pigs at a trough . \nthe grandma is an oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her sagging breasts . \nthe father is gruff , is fired from a blue-collar job , is sexually inadequate , and cannot communicate with his family about his feelings . \nthe mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone . \nthe brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood . \nsherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to . \nbut the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy . \nthe family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct . \nand you got the feeling that these crass people couldn't act like this all the time . \nthe sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt , making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic . \nafter a while , their conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story . \nits also a damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker -- who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london -- and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such a lame story line . \neven the best effects can't seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days . \nnow that i think about it , the worst thing about this film has to be all the money that it will make . \npeople will be lined up around the block for it . \nthe studios will concoct the a sequel for release in the summer of 2002 . \neddie murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or five roles , but he'll play every character in the movie . \ni just can't wait to see eddie murphy in a love scene with himself . \n", "brian de palma , the director who bought us carrie , dressed to kill and mission : impossible is back , and has bought all his technical expertise with him . \nsadly , he forget to bring a good story and believable characters . \nnic cage plays rick santaro , a fast talking cop who is watching a boxing match with his friend commander kevin dunne ( sinise . ) \nan assassination takes place , and santaro tries to peace together how it took place , trying to work out the roles of the people involved in this conspiracy . \nthe film uses flashbacks and video cameras to bring the mystery together . \nhowever , the film doesn't keep the mystery for long , and once the big 'secret' is out concerning kevin dunne , the film is at a dead end . \nalthough there are some fantastic shots by de palma , including a 15 minute steadicam shot at the start of the film , halfway through the film drops dead . \nthe problem is that de palma doesn't have a strong story or characters to work with . \nhe tries to offshoot this with flashy camera techniques , but pretty soon this has no effect on the audience , and i quickly got bored . \nnic cage and gary sinise try to inject some life into some poorly realised characters , but it's no use . \nthey are boring , faceless , and completely unlikeable . \nyes , another problem with the film is that there's no-one to root for . \nwe're supposed to be on cage's side , because his character becomes nicer throughout the film . \nhowever , his change is sadly unbelievable . \npoor gary sinise's character is terrible , who completely changes throughout the start , the middle and the end , in an appalling way . \nthe film's use of flashback quickly gets boring . \nwhile clever and interesting the first few times , it quickly becomes apparent that flashbacks are being used because the film has nowhere to go . \nthey certainly don't increase the tension or suspense of the movie . \nthere is small thread of suspense running through the film , but it certainly doesn't make this film a powerhouse thriller , rather just a slightly below average one . \nthe script is lousy and contrived , the characters flat and two dimensional . \ncertainly not good factors for a film passing itself off for a thriller . \nthe most depressing aspect of the film is that it had potential . \nthere's a good story buried in snake eyes , it's just bogged down in razzle dazzle and flashbacks . \nit also gives itself away far too quickly , rather than leaving the big twist for the end . \nwhile the performances are intriguing , especially by newcomer carla gugino as a sexy 'number cruncher' wrapped up in the case , there's no way of altering the fact that snake eyes is a terminal case of style of substance , and unless you're a big fan of either cage or flash

best friends . \nstill besieged by nightmarish memories of the man responsible for it all , she seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown . \nshe can't concentrate on her schoolwork , can't get a good night's sleep , and is even frightened by the shadows and the blinking strobe lights at a local dance club . \neverywhere she looks , she sees visions of the man in a rubber slicker with the hook on his hand . \nin the first movie , `i know what you did last summer' , julie and three of her friends accidentally kill a man , running him down while driving down a dark mountain highway . \nto cover their misdeed , they dump the body into the ocean . \nhowever , he never quite died and returned to hunt down julie and her friends . \njulie and one other , ray ( freddie prinze jr . ) , survived only to make this dismal sequal . \nneeding some desparate rest and relaxation , she is elated to learn that her college roommate , karla ( brandy ) , has won a trip for four to a secluded tropical island . \naccompanying these two girls are karla's overbearing boyfriend , tyrell ( mehki phifer ) and a potential beau for julie . \nbut was this contest too good to be true ? \nthe resort is filled with a skeleton staff that seemed like love boat rejects . \nmeanwhile , the hotel is practically deserted as the storm season is about to begin . \nthis presumably creates a venue where they will be secluded and will have no possible means off the island . \neventually , they will be hunted down during power outages and chased around during intense lightning storms . \nas you might have guessed , somewhere in the shadows lurk a mysteriously strange figure that is wearing a rubber slicker and wielding a hook . \njulie tries to convince her friends that the killer is on the island ( an eerie touch is when she is singing \" i will survive \" at the karaoke bar and the words scroll \" i still know . . . \" ) , but her friends chalk it up to paranoia . \nbut the body count soon starts to rise , and for julie , it's going to be the worst vacation of her life . \nthe funny ( yes , i used the word 'funny' ) thing about this movie is that i heard more chortling and giggling ( maybe it was my giggling ) than i heard screaming . \nthis movie boils down to a mindless slashfest that never conjures up any amount of wry wit or even a quirky campiness . \nthere isn't even any

about this movie that satisfied me . \ni was thoroughly irritated with tyrell , who incessantly ranted and raved about his sexual libido . \ni secretly wished for him to get filleted . \ndid he get 'hooked' ? \nwell , let's just say that if he didn't , i would give this film a grade of \" d \" . \n", "lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode 4 : episode 1 is a boring , empty spectacle that features some nice special effects . \nafter the familiar 'a long time ago . . . .

\nepisode 1 is just disappointing . \nit's got high production values , but little else . \nthe music is meandering , except near the end . \nthe plot gives us no-one to root for , or even care for . \nthe effects are nice , but dull . \nthe plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should . \nthere's an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair , and many clich ? s are catered for throughout the film . \napart from a remotely exciting pod race sequence , episode 1 is a dry affair that serves little purpose , except to make money and to get us to watch episode 2 to see what

before it happens . \nthere is no point in this film that any suspense is ever afoot . \nwhile we are on the subject of the story , the story also provides every chance it can to disrobe an actress . \nthe film goes to the extent of putting a shower in the manager's office . \ni'm sorry folks but this is completely unnecessary , ridiculous , and hurts the story more ( if that is still possible ) . \nthe script for this film is completely pathetic . \nthe lines the actresses come out with are completely horrible . \nthe only thing that i think could have happened is that the actors made up the script as they went along . \nhere is an example of the wonderful dialog . \nthe scene is two girls have just entered a gun store and have picked out a * really * big gun . \nthe line is \" my dad

1992 but was never released in the united states ) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage , and , while it's evident that this could be a fascinating live production , the translation to the screen is a creative disaster . \nenduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art -- lifeless and tedious . \nthe qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium . \ntectonic plates has a storyline , although the narrative is developed in a decidedly non-traditional fashion , with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences . \nit's not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie ( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious , all-but-screaming , \" look ! \nart ! \" ) , \nalthough it keeps the audience distanced from the characters . \nbecause we're constantly made aware that we're watching a play or a movie , it's impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer's ideas . \nthey're not real , sympathetic , or believable . \ni'm willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different , but this particular experiment is not a success . \ntectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine ( marie gignac ) , an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor , jacques ( lapage ) . \none day , he disappears , and , fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love , madeleine travels to venice to kill herself . \nwhile preparing to commit suicide , she encounters drug addict constance ( celine bonnier ) , who causes madeleine to re-think her decision . \nmeanwhile , jacques has moved to new york city , where he starts cross-dressing , calls himself jennifer , and becomes a successful counter-culture talkshow host . \nwith settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland , supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deaf/mute , and cultural references that point to chopin , george sand , and jim morrison , tectonic plates is unique , if nothing else . \nhowever , as interesting as the film sounds ( and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising ) , it never really delivers . \nthe tone is soporific , the supposedly-intellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting , the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner ( although it doesn't take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant ) , and the symbolism is obvious . \ntectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth , but it takes one-hundred minutes to get across this transparent point . \nthere are some worthwhile moments , such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages ( although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who aren't bilingual ) . \nthe only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because ( a ) it's different , ( b ) it's not like anything they've seen before , and ( c ) it's pretentious . \nfor everyone else , it's not only a waste of time , but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage . \n", "various films seen at the seattle film festival : \nit's all true/three men on a raft ( u . s . a . , 1942/1986 ) director : orson welles \na recently uncovered one-fourth of orson welle's planned \" docu-drama \" of amazing stories around the world named it's all true , this short dealt with welle's attempts to document the actions of several brazilian fisherman in 1942 who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage to rio on a raft . \nwhile several clips of the film are seen , the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welle's attempts to film it , despite studio problems , a staggering workload , and extremely ill fortune on the set . \nimpressive photography , but really only interesting to film historians . \nsadie thompson ( u . s . a . , 1928 ) director : raoul walsh screenwriter : raoul walsh , from the john colton play \" rain \" , based on w . somerset maugham's story \" miss thompson \" cast : gloria swanson , raoul walsh , lionel barrymore silent \nafter the discussion of the newly-restored version of frank capra's lost horizon , where several scenes had been restored using stills , i was interested to see sadie thompson , where the last 5 minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago . \nthis is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story \" miss thompson \" . \nthis is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seen--little awkwardness , and a very clever script . \nthe actors : gloria swanson , raoul walsh ( who also directed and wrote the screenplay ) and especially lionel barrymore , as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadie's soul , but really wants to get her between the sheets , is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel . \nswanson adds real life to the character , adding an worldly , affectionate air to the bawdy sadie . \nunfortunately , the ending is rather poorly tied up ; it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of live-action film , or the original script . \nthe happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on ( i cannot believe maugham's short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia ) ; the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion we've been waiting an hour and a half for . \nstill , it's entertaining right up to the end ; certainly barrymore's incredibly hammy performance ( which , nonetheless , works , perhaps due to the silent screen ) is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells , bakkers , and robertses of the religious worlds . \na c movie ; worth 2 . 50 if you can find it . \nthe pied piper ( czechoslovakia , 1986 ) director : jim barta screenwriter : kamil piza \nthis is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids . \nit tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate , and with a lot of political comment along with it . \nperhaps economic content is a better word--it certainly doesn't show capitalism in a good light . \nnor human nature , nor anything else , for that matter . \nas you may have guessed , this is not a tgif film ; this is the kind of film you are glad is over . \nnot that it wasn't interesting for technical reasons ; this is stop-animation that is very well done . \nall the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnuts--except for the animated stuffed rats . \nboy , sounds like a real comedy vehicle , doesn't it ? \nadd onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison , and you have something to give the wee ones ( and some of the mentally unstable larger folk ) to keep them up at night . \nsome gore . \ndon't bring children to

( west germany , 1986 ) director/screenwriter : peter timm cast : rainier grenkowitz , nadja engelbrecht , alexander hauff , thomas besvater sub-titled \nthis film takes us back and forth over the east german/west german border with meier , an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies and leaves him a good deal of money . \nhis uncle ( also in the west ) sneaks meier out of the country , unknown to the east germans . \nmeier , however , is less than thrilled-- his girlfriend , his friends and his job ( which he likes ) all exist in east germany . \nafter a round-the-world trip ( his boss think's he's on leave in bulgaria ) , meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with a fake id , and uses his money and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crew's work--while everyone think's he's still living in east germany . \nof course , something goes wrong--and the ending is very funny , but it takes the film too long to get there . \nthe humor is spread too thin , and much of the plot is too obvious ( as is the acting ) . \nstill , a good concept for the comedy , and the last five minutes are pretty funny . \nc -- $2 . 50 . \nthe right hand man ( australia , 1986 ) director : di drew screenplay : helen hodgman cast : rupert everett , hugo weaving , arthur dignam , jennifer claire , catherine mcclements \nafter a lifetime of movie-going , and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival , i've learned several rules which , while not absolute , should certainly be given deference to : \n1 ) be wary of french comedies . \nthese people like jerry lewis . \n2 ) ken russell is never going to grow up , no matter how long you wait . \n3 ) any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as \" old pouty-lips \" is probably not worth watching . \n4 ) when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography , watch out ! \naustralia has good cinematographers up the whazoo , but since weir and miller left for foreign shores , finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult ( not impossible--witness malcolm last year ) task . \nwell , i ignored rules 3 & 4 last night , and sat through a film that should be in the golden turkey awards . \nit's as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the 30's about tragedy among the gentry , and falling in love with people below your station , and horses . \nlots and lots of horses . \nthe film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship , which i guess is some kind of foreshadowing , because the missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir . \nunfortunately , said son , a reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times , kills his father and loses an arm during a racing accident . \nhighlights include the amputation sequence ; the doctor's daughter , who has the hots for the son , tasting his urine for a diagnosis ; their tender kissing with a window between them ( while it's raining--you'd think a woman studying medicine would know better ) . \nthe photography is good , but i kept wishing for b&w--everything seems sepia-colored anyway . \nactually , i wished i was watching swimming to cambodia instead , but that's life . \ngrade : z . avoid like the plague , unless you're looking for inadvertent yuks . \n", "capsule : the weakest and least engaging of the alien movies , dragged down by an uninvolving story and no real tension . \nalien 3 ( the \" 3 \" should be in superscript ) is a sad and wan entry in what was shaping up as one of the best sf sagas ever put on screen . \nit continues the story of ripley , the space-trucker-turned-impromptu-survivalist , but seems remarkably uninterested in her . \nin fact , the movie seems lucky to be interested in anything at all , it's so elegaic and limp . \na little of this would have been nice for atmosphere , but the movie telegraphs its own tragedy from the beginning . \nat the end of the last film ( aliens ) , ripley and two survivors were on their way home . \nunfortunately , an alien pod had been deposited in their ship , and wound up triggering off their ejection in an escape pod . \nthe pod crashes on firorina 161 , a prison planet designed to house the incurably criminally violent . \nripley lives through the crash ; the others do not . \nthe prison is a grim place , even as prisons go -- it's been built around the remnants of an abandoned steelworks , which provides no end of techno-gothic backdrops for the actors to be backlit against . \nlice are endemic , and so ripley's head is shaved ( another surreal touch ) . \nat first it looks like she just has to hold out as an unwelcome guest until a company rescue ship can arrive , but it doesn't stay that way . \none of the other eggs on board the wrecked escape pod hatches , and soon a newly-gestated alien is running amuck . \nworse , it looks like ripley herself has been impregnated . \nwhat's weird is how little tension this generates , except near the end , when the pressure is being troweled on through every cheap cinematic form of cheating imaginable : loud music , shaky camerawork , etc . sigourney weaver has become comfortable with the role , and she does well with it , but this time the role has been underwritten and left slack . \nthe supporting actors are also not given a lot to do : the doctor ( charles dance ) and another , rather religious inmate ( charles s . dutton , very good ) , hiave presence , but they're not asked to do anything with it . \nin light of the impending sequel , which apparently plays fast and loose with the ending of this movie , i will not talk about the ending -- except to say that they found a remarkably good ending for such a drab movie . \nit's strange that some of the desperate and improvisational thinking that they found to wind up this story couldn't have driven the rest of it . \n", " \" from the director of \" the nightmare before christmas \" it said in the previews , which i'm guessing was said to get people to go see the movie , obviously it hasn't worked since the $75 million dollar movie has yet to break $5 million . \nto each it's own however , since \" monkey bone \" is not only a bad movie all together , but technically well-made . \na tragic waste of talent and incredible visual effects . \nstu miley is the genius behind the new phenomena \" monkey bone \" a crude comic strip , that everyone wants to merchandise , they go to great links to get it as well , including dollars that let out fart powder . \nwhen stu and his girlfriend , julie ( bridget fonda ) are in a freak car accident ( you'll see ) stu goes into a coma ,

spots monkey bone ( whom he really can't stand ) he tries to keep him under control . \nmaking a new friend kitty ( rose mcgowan ) he learns that if he gets an exit pass from death , he can go back up and live his life . \nwhen monkey bone and stu steal a pass , monkey bone becomes a trader and takes it and goes into stu's body . \nnow monkey bone must get everyone to buy these dolls with nightmare powder , so everyone has nightmares . . . or \nsomething like that . \nrather complex ( in fact more than it needs to be ) \" monkey bone \" had potential in the script and even the story . \nwhat is considerably noticeable is the gaping plot holes , and lack of character development . \nfor instance we really don't get to know who stu or julie are , so why should we even care ? \nkitty played well by rose mcgowan ha a story behind her , but we are not given a chance to know her . \nthe cast is decent however , brendan fraser seems to be enjoying himself in the role as stu miley , but becomes awfully annoying when monkey bone takes over his body . \nbridget fonda is dreary and seems to bring the film to a screeching halt , her performance is bad and she seems miscast . \ndave foley isn't given enough to do , as well as \" will & grace's \" megan mullally who can be funny . \nthe standout performance is the voice of nick turturro as monkey bone himself , he is very funny and entertaining and really keeps the film from being a total bust . \nthe special effects of \" monkey bone \" is what might really bring in some curious viewers , these special effects are highly effective , and nice to look at with the eyes . \nsome of them are believable and some unbelievable . . . for \nmonkey bone he seems to be like stuart little , you really don't realize that he is animated . . . but \non occasion it sneaks up on you . \nthe direction by henry selick is good , but at times he doesn't know what kind of film he wants to make , and the ending climax falls off the cliff . \nit's too bad really , \" monkey bone \" could have been a real good movie , but with it's heavily done hack job , and lack of character development it just sinks when the end credits role . \nfor those curious however , it might be worth the rental , but other than that avoid this one . \n", "numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past sci-fi , suspense thrillers . \nsoldier is a multi ? crossbreed between the likes of terminator , aliens and offspring . \nthe problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is a real mongrel ? not well made and should have been put down before production got off the ground . \nbesides this , the action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age . \nthe fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seem laboured , slow and sluggish , and could have done with better choreography . \nrussell who is usually a good actor in b-grade action flicks is unusually hampered by his character ? sergeant todd , who seems more like a sergeant toad . \nbesides having almost no dialogue , his character appears stunted , zombie-like which is in line with his screen persona , but scores little points of empathy with the audience . \nthis movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul anderson , whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth . \nalthough this movie does not come anywhere close to the strangeness of former , it is still a long way from anything considered desirable . \n", "a documentary from the twin hughes brothers , allen

it seemed to crop up in every sentence they used . \nit makes for a film with no surprises or nothing fresh to say , but if one has a sense a humor for what their lifestyle is about , then some of what they rap about might seem amusing . \nthey seem to all want to be thought of as businessmen , in the business because it is the easiest way for them to make big money . \nit's also a power trip , accomplished by manipulating the girls to work for them , mostly by humiliating them and keeping them in place . \nthis sleazy pic , soon became grating and wore out its welcome to my unreceptive ears . \nthese verbose pimps had a smart answer for everything and never knew when to shut their face . \nthe hughes brothers used as their pimp role models , the feather-hatted , fur-coated , diamond ring-wearing , gold chain wearing , flashy cadillac-cruising pimp of the late '70s blaxploitation movies--like the mack and willie dynamite . \nalso used as reference , was iceberg slim's best-seller pimp , the story of my life . \nwe meet pimps such as : fillmore slim , c-note , charm , k-red , gorgeous dre , bishop don magic juan , and rosebudd . \nthey readily discuss their business arrangements : including percentages , lifestyles , knockin ( stealing another pimp's ho ) , and the thrill they get from women giving them money . \nthese dudes needed no prompting to talk , as they just love to brag about about themselves . \n \" priests need nuns , '' yaps c-note , a san francisco pimp . \n \" doctors need nurses . \nso ho's need pimps . '' \nas he tries to persuasively make the same case all the other pimps in the film make ; that the girls need them to show them the ropes , how to make money , to be their security blankets , protectors , and counselors . \nthe race issue was brought up right from the film's onset , as a number of white interviewees , regular citizens , note that their impression of a pimp , is that he's the lowest form of human . \nwhile , we are told , in the black community , the pimp is looked upon as a successful entrepenaur , riding around in fancy cars , flashing wads of money , dressed in a flamboyant style , where his snake-gaiter shoes might cost him a grand , and where he boasts hollywood style status in the community . \nwe also see that the black pimps have a number of white girls in their stable and we see how they treat them like dirt , as the film implies that this could be payback for the days of slavery , of master and slave relations . \nthe film was all about pimp style and their projected image , as they run a hard-sell riff about the virtues of their work . \nthere are different styles of pimping , but the film mentions them only as being \" macks \" and \" players \" or \" real pimps \" and \" perpetrator pimps , \" but no further clarity is attempted . \nit is also failed to get the women's side to this story of abuse , primarily taking the pimp at his word . \nthe film could never get to the core of what makes the pimp think in such a perverted way as he does , as the filmmakers were taking for a ride by the pimps , who were looking only to pose in front of the camera and say their thing , hungry for their 15-minutes of fame . \nthe only laughs i got out of this bleak look at an american subculture , was hearing how a few pimps retired and what they are now up to . \ndanny brown became a blues singer so he could keep his pimp's wardrobe . \nwhile a hollywood pimp called rosebudd , married his ho and turned square , working to support his wife and daughter as a telemarketer . \n", "gord brody ( tom green ) is an aspiring animator approaching thirty who still lives in parents jim ( rip torn ) and julie's ( julie hagerty , \" airplane \" ) basement . \nas dad declares all out war , gord secures a job in a cheese sandwich factory in far off la and sets off to make his dreams come true . \ngord doesn't make much of a go on his first attempt and lands back home with fawning mom and outraged dad in \" freddy got fingered . \" \ntom green cowrites ( with \" tom green show \" scribe derek harvie ) , directs and stars in what is essentially tom green's primal scream . \nso , if tom green screams in an empty theater , does he make a sound ? \nit's clear that \" freddy got fingered \" is at least partially autobiographical and green sure has one hell of a complex about his dad ( mom gets off easier when sonny boy advises her to go out and have sex with basketball players and greeks ) . \nwhile this may be of interest to his hard core fans , there's little about green's mania on display here to recommend this movie to anyone else . \nthe film starts promisingly enough , with a well executed skateboarding scene through a shopping mall set to the sex pistols' 'problem' ( green's put together a first rate soundtrack ) and yes , i laughed a few times . \ngreen's flummoxing of a security guard with psychotic ramblings and his attempt to draw , make music and eat at the same time ( the 'daddy would you like some sausages' scene repeatedly shown in the film's trailer ) are inspired comedy . \nbut what's funny about a paraplegic girlfriend who gets turned on by having her legs caned or a skateboarding injury that results in an exposed kneecap ? \na baby delivery bit shows some groan-inducing promise until enough blood is splattered to coagulate the laughs . \nyounger ( by three years ) brother freddy's internment at the institute for sexually abused children does nothing but confirm one's worst fears regarding the film's title and green's infamous 'handling' of a real horse , while not nearly as shocking as it would seem , doesn't make sense . \nby the time he repeats the gag with an elephant at film's end , the overall effect is numbness . \nwhile \" freddy got fingered \" has the admirable end result of depicting the harm in demeaning a child's self esteem , it's essentially a whole lot of tom green running around being noisy . \nrip torn , what were you thinking ? \n", "much ado about nothing . \nah , how sweet the irony ! \nit's accepted wisdom in some circles - among english literature nuts , mainly - that whenever a critic knocks shakespeare they are only doing so through ignorance . \nhe just doesn't \" understand \" shakespeare , you will hear them say . \nthe bard's work is apparently beyond criticism . \nwhat a load of old cobblers . \nif these arbiters of public taste think kenneth branaugh's film of shakespeare's \" comedy \" much ado about nothing is comedy in any modern sense of the word , it's time to get a life . \nget monty python . \nget woody allen . \nget john waters . \nwhatever . \njust get a real taste of some clever , witty , risky comedy . \nand banish this nonsense to where it belongs . \ndrama and tragedy was shakespeare's strength . \nto my sensibilities - and i'm no stick in the mud - much ado about nothing resonates with no spark whatsoever . \nno kidding : this film ranks among the most embarrassing two hours i have ever spent in a cinema in my 20 years of movie going . \nthe only thing that stopped me walking out was loyalty to my lady friend , as this was our day out and i hadn't seen her in ages . \nbut boy , does she owe me one ! \ni won't spend too much time on the plot . \nbasically , we follow the trials and tribulations of two would-be couples - one young , the other older . \nthere's some dark treachery amongst all this , but everyone is so awfully jolly that you'd hardly know it . \nmind you , there's nothing wrong with the basic story . \ngood romantic comedies based on similar premises abound . \nnothing wrong with most of the cast , either . \nbranaugh , emma thompson and denzel washington are all talented performers . \nthe problem is the script , or more accurately , shakespeare's original text . \nlight comedy shouldn't be complex . \nyet wrapped in elizabethan english , the dialogue becomes difficult to comprehend . \nfor this alone it will be a problem for modern audiences unschooled in shakespeare and in search of nothing more than a good , undemanding laugh . \nthe only laughs to escape my belly were brought on by the gloriously inept performance of keanu reeves , the actor once again miscast as a jealous half-brother or something . \nbut when dissected and understood , what it all boils down to is that this stuff is just so goddamn lame . \nthis is comedy so clean and nice and corny and so devoid of danger that it leaves this viewer totally cold . \nho , ho , ho , boy likes girl ! \nho , ho , ho , men are such klutzes ! \nho , ho , ho , she's so awfully clumsy ! \noh please ! \nthere's wit in here somewhere , i'm told . \ni call it pretentious . \nsomething lightweight striving to be something sophisticated through clever wordplay . \nin the end , it's cringeworthy . \nwatching some of the cinema patrons around me collapse with laughter made much ado about nothing a very weird movie going experience . \ncomedy ? \nbah , humbug ! \n", "another formula 'feel good' quirky comedy from the british isles , much like \" waking ned devine , \" and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line . \nit is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town , such as tolerant vicars and policemen , plenty of eccentrics , and of locals who stick together through thick and thin . \nthe strength of this film lies in its rational theme , that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol . \nthe film is tolerable until after its first hour , it then falls completely apart , becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas . \nbut its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to , at least , be viewed as containing a pertinent message . \nits message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the 'war on drugs' is about to be escalated into colombia . \nthe drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future , it has so far just ended up causing america's jails to be overcrowded with non-violent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing america's drug usage and drug supply . \nbillions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war , by backing a corrupt government ( remember vietnam ! ) with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country . \neverything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home , so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war . \nthe film's mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public , something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance , but one that is better received late than never . \nthere has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this , rather than making it a police matter altogether . \nthe film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle-aged woman , grace ( brenda blethyn ) , who fell out of an airplane , evidently committing suicide . \nthe widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined . \nhe left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up , without her knowledge , their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage . \nthe widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husband's enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless . \nshe also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london , honey ( quick ) . \nwhat makes the affair doubly unsatisfying , is that when conferring with honey , she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her . \neven though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can , the creditors swoop down on her like vultures . \nher gardener and handyman , matthew ( ferguson ) , decides to stay on with her , despite his last check bouncing . \nsince she is an expert amateur horticulturist , he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants , which he grows for private use . \nthe two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity , as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be high-quality stuff . \nfor grace , this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt ; for the scotsman , matthew , it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky ( valerie ) . \nthe locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed : the police sergeant ( campbell ) pretends not to notice what the bright lights in grace's greenhouse is for , the friendly vicar ( phillips ) counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you can't control , and the doctor ( clunes ) enjoys smoking the weed for recreation . \nthe story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a big-time drug dealer instead of having matthew go , because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesn't want matthew to end up in jail . \nit is interesting to note , that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you , only that one can go to jail . \nthe scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london , trying to find a drug dealer , while dressed out of place , in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal , was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole , whereby it never recovered its dignity . \nthe film moves into the formula mode , whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive , as she meets an international drug dealer , a frenchman ( tcheky karyo ) , who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences , thereby becoming a celebrity . \nthings work out in a ridiculous way , where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace , where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood . \nthere are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded . \nthis 'unhip' film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly , but should be tolerated as something naughty middle-aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute . \nummm ! \n", " \" love to kill \" starts off aimlessly and gets progressively less coherent as time passes . \nat the outset , the movie appears to be about tony danza , who's an illegal distributor of guns , trying to establish a relationship with an unsuspecting woman . \ndanza sets up a double date with her , her sister , and a collegue of his . \neverything seems to be going well , until the sister accidentally dies by falling down a set of stairs . \nmuch confusion and mahem ensues , as the death is covered up and other associates of danza's begin to emerge , all after one thing or another . \nsound confusing ? \nit is . \ni think what the filmmakers were trying to do is take the standard crime movie and throw in a little humour and levity . \nin some respects , it works . \nbut the majority of the film is a convoluted and confusing mess . \ncharacters keep popping up with no explanation , demanding money for deals that occur off-screen . \nthe only aspect of the movie that actually works is the budding relationship between danza and the dead woman's sister . \nbut so little time is devoted to this part of the story , we never really become too familiar with these characters , and because of this , we don't really care what happens to them . \nwell , i didn't , at least . \none thing i will give the movie is that it's a complete departure for tony danza . \nhere's a guy , because of his many sitcom roles , who's ingrained in the consciousness as a nice guy who always does the right thing . \nhere , he plays a man who's just looking out for himself , and if that means he needs to kill in order to save his own skin , so be it . \ni was very impressed by his performance , and within minutes of the start of the film , i had forgotten all about his good-guy persona . \nmichael madsen is also good as an associate of danza's who spends half the movie buddying up to him and the other half trying to kill him . \nlike i said , it's not exactly a linear storyline . \n \" love to kill \" should be praised for trying to do something different with the well worn crime genre , but it's just too bad that the story doesn't really add up to much . \nthe stars deserved better , and so did the audience . \n", "whether you like the beatles or not , nobody wants to see the bee gee's take on some of the fab four's best known songs . \nwell , maybe that's not true . \n . \n . \nmaybe you're curious , the way you have to look in your hanky after you blow your nose . \nyou just have to know how bad bad can be . \nif that's the case , rejoice , because it was twenty years ago today ( or so ) that sgt . \npepper's lonely hearts club band was released ( unleashed ? ) to the world , and thanks to our modern technological advances , you can find this retched piece of filmmaking on vhs . \nderived from the lyrics of various beatles' songs , sgt . \npepper's tells the story of the fictitious band made popular from the song ( and album ) of the same name , released in 1967 . \nof course , the movie was made eleven years later , the gibbs three have become the lonely hearts , peter frampton is the one and only billy shears , and aside from being about a rock band , the story doesn't correlate to the song at all . \nand oh , what joy - we're the lovely audience they'd like to take home with them . \ni don't think so . \nbut at least these characters are actually * people * in a beatles' song , whereas other characters such as strawberry fields ( sandy farina ) gets her name from a song about a * place * called strawberry fields . \nthe debate over this is really quite futile when it comes down to it , because all the film really has to offer is a feast of horrid cover tunes , embarrassing cameo appearances ( george burns ? ! \nsteve martin ? ! ? \nalice cooper ? ! ? ! ) , and uuuuuuggggggglllllllyyyyy 70's fashion and faces . \ncheck please ! \nthe plot is a bit unclear . \npeople with bad 70's hair run around in leisure suits engaging in music video sequences that look like a sick and twisted world of make-believe from an overly demented mr . rogers . \nmean mr . mustard ( frankie howerd ) somehow gets hold of all billy & co . 's instruments , calling dr . maxwell edison ( steve martin with a silver hammer and an out-of-key singing voice ) , the sun king , marvin sunk ( alice cooper ! ) , and a couple of creepy robots to his aid . \nsupposedly this is a horrible thing ? \ni guess in heartland , the talent is pretty non-existent . \nmeanwhile , the lonely hearts are off doing the classic \" sex , drugs , and rock n' roll \" thing , leaving poor strawberry fields without her true love , billy . \nshe sets out to find him , leaving her poor dad and mom ( mrs . \nfields ! \nhey , wanna cookie ? ) \nall alone to sing a horrible rendition of \" she's leaving home \" , accompanied by those same creepy robots . \nbut is billy getting it on with lucy ( dianne steinberg ) ? \nya know , the diamond possessing girl who hangs out in the sky ? \nwell , there's some crazy chick singing soprano on the roof of a building next to a bus stop , and i assume that's who it was . \nit's movies like this that make ya sit back and ask the unanswerable question , \" what the hell were they thinking ? ? ? \" \nnobody will ever know , but as a novelty , sgt . \npepper's is one to examine . \ncarol channing , robert palmer , keith carradine - they're all here . \nbut why ? ? ? ? \nwho knows . \nit's irrelevant . \nthere's as much meaning to be found here as there is to be found in your belly-button lint , although the latter may be more interesting . \nwith the recent onslaught of 70's nostalgia in the movie world ( the ice storm , boogie nights , reissues of the star wars trilogy , etc . ) , let's pray this doesn't get a special 20th anniversary , second-chance in theaters . \nin the words of paul mccartney , live and let die . \nin fact , bury this one while you still can . \n", "warning : spoilers are included in this review . . . \nbut it doesn't really make much of a difference . \ndeep impact begins the official summer movie season , and it also brings back memories of 1997 . \nremember when dante's peak came out in february ? \na few months later , volcano was released . \nthe first film was smart , exhilirating , and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen . \nthe latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent . \nwell , it's deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition . \nthis time , unfortunately , the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon , the upcoming comet-disaster to be released the beginning of july . \nof course , the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine , and so i am in the minority , as i was when i stood on the side of dante's peak . \nbut while watching deep impact , i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film . \napparently many did , and it utterly baffles me . \nto be completely honest , i haven't had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life . \nvolcano had implausibilities up the wazoo , but it was still rather fun to watch . \ndeep impact doesn't just have implausibilities , it also contains cheap human drama , incredibly horrible special effects , and a poorly constructed plot . \nthe only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters . \ndeep impact begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies ; advanced technology sets it in the future , but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater , pushing it back to 1993 ) . \na line of students is outside at night , peering through telescopes at the dark sky above . \namong these are leo biederman ( elijah wood ) and sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) . \nleo unknowingly discovers a comet , and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer , who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds . \nhe races off to mail the information , but is killed in a reckless car accident . \na year passes , and nothing is heard about it again . \nwe are then introduced to jenny lerner ( t ? a leoni ) , a reporter for msnbc . \nshe gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover-up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse ( james cromwell ) . \nshe talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie . \nafter talking with rittenhouse , and unsatisfied with the information she gets , she decides to use the internet for help . \nluckily , she knows exactly how to spell the certain \" ellie \" that she is looking for ( they spell it ele in the film . . . \nthat girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled ) . \nbefore she can use the information , the government decides to push her car off the road . \nthey take her in to meet the president of the united states , president beck ( morgan freeman ) . \nbeck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference . \nnaturally , she wants to be compensated , and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question . \nand so , yada yada yada , they reveal the comet to the public and their plans : send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive . \nthey announce a plan called \" ark , \" which is their only hope for survival . \na computer will select 800 , 000 people at random . \nthese people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won't kill off the entire human race . \nafter two years , the dust will settle ( actually , it would take much , much longer--approximately ninety years , from what i understand ) and the humans could come back to the surface and start over . \nthe rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures , but there is one subplot worth mentioning . \njenny and her father , jason ( maximilian schell ) , have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom . \nthe final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional . \nit's a shame that nothing else is heartfelt . \nnow , of course , we all know that the comet does impact the surface . \nthe title alone suggests it , and the previews actually show it ! \nby doing this , absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won't work . \ndirector mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show \" er . \" \nher major film debut was the peacemaker , a pathetic and heartless action film . \nwell , this time leder outdid herself , creating a film worse than that one . \nsuggestion to ms . leder : please , stay away from the big screen , or at least the action genre . \nmuch of the blame can be placed on leder directly , because the pace is disastrously off . \nthroughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed ( it goes from months to weeks to hours ) . \nit literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real-time--it's that boring . \nof course , leder isn't all to blame for it . \nscreenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time . \nwhat starts out promising soon turns deadly ( for the audience anyway ) . \nchock full of cheesy one liners ( \" you know , you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school ! \" ) \nand stupid characters , you might think we were back in the 70s again . \nonly one of the subplots is remotely interesting , while the rest are forgettable and boring . \nand the main plot is so outrageous that you can't figure out if this film is supposed to be an action , drama , or sci-fi . \nto put it simply : the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation . \nthat's right , 80% miss , and 20% hit . \nscenes above the earth are well done , and the orbiting ship is majestic . \nbut the comet is a huge mistake , making it more laughable than frightening . \nthe concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough , but that's forgiveable . \nwhat isn't forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface . \ngive me a break , will ya ? \nand of course , the much hyped collision of comet and earth . \nwell , it is far from spectacular , and it makes independence day look brilliant . \nthe water rushing towards the land is effective , but once it hits the continent , the effects turn ridiculous . \ncgi water is used , and it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks . \nin fact , i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days . \njust when we think visual effects can't be improved , along comes a film to show that they really can and should be . \none thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder's direction , which also influences the actors . \nleder loves to show the actors' faces before and during moments of terror . \nthis reminded me of another action director , renny harlin ( die hard 2 , cliffhanger ) . \nbut harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations . \nleder likes to flaunt people's fears via their faces , but instead of coming off as sympathetic , leder seems more of a sadist . \none moment has an astronaut flying off into space . \nthis should be enough to warrant a response from the audience , but leder wants to go farther and shows us the person's face while drifting into space . \nthis is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience , and i , for one , am not going to be fooled . \non another note , leder's film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts . \nthe pace does pick up , and some very emotional moments are shown . \nthen again , when you watch people cry for their loved ones , it's obvious it will be emotional . \nit's mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into \" feeling \" for the characters , but it didn't work for me . \nbut anyway , the actors do as much as they can with what they are given . \nt ? a leoni ( bad boys , tv's \" the naked truth \" ) is the best of the film , and she is given the meatiest role . \nher character is made stronger by leoni's presence , and we grow to care for her . \nrobert duvall is energetic and fun to watch , but his character is turned into shreds by the plot . \nelijah wood also comes off rather successfully , but he still hasn't had many good roles ( wood , stick to drama ! \nyou are too talented for this stuff ) . \nvanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable , and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen . \nmaximilian schell is distracting , but he does provide some nice humor . \nmorgan freeman has been infinitely better than this , and gives one of his most shallow performances to date ( which is quite remarkable for him ) . \nleelee sobieski could have been better , but i think she just suffered from a poorly written character . \na special note should go to ron eldard and denise crosby . \neldard is good in his role , but is limited by the plot . \ncrosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tv's \" star trek : the next generation . \" \nseeing her was one of the highlights of the film . \noverall , a very talented cast virtually wasted . \ndeep impact is rated pg-13 for disaster related elements and brief language . \nthis is one of the worst films of the year , and if it is any omen of things to come , this summer could be one of the worst ever . \nluckily , the x-files movie is coming up , and hopefully armageddon will be more successful . \nit's a shame that this film will do so successfully because it just isn't worth much . \ncosting nearly $75 million , with special effects done by the illustrious ilm ( which is a huge shocker ) , and with a score composed by oscar-winner james horner ( titanic ) , one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience . \nwell , it's not . \nwhen the comet does hit the earth , you almost wish it could just take this film along with it . \n", "my first press screening of 1998 and already i've gotten a prime candidate for my worst ten of the year list . \nwhat an auspicious beginning ! \nwelcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders that the studios opened in late december in new york and l . a . and which are just now beginning to appear elsewhere . \nfirestorm , the directorial debut of dances with wolves's academy award winning cinematographer dean semler , is the first of the new year's crop of movies . \nas our story opens , the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are \" smokejumpers . \" \nwe then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl , where one of the gung-ho guys is taking a romance quiz from \" cosmopolitan . \" \nhaving the time of their lives , they then jump into the middle of a burning forest . \nwhen , even in the beginning , the director can't get the small parts right , you can sense the movie is in trouble . \nwith the noisy fire roaring all about them and with the trapped people huddled near their gasoline-filled cars , smokejumper monica ( christianne hirt ) tells them to get away from their soon-to-explode vehicles . \nnot bothering to shout nor even get close to them , she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people . \nmiraculously , they manage to hear her and move away . \nin a movie that specializes in cheap shots , the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in a nearby burning building . \nas it does throughout , overly dramatic cinematographer stephen f . windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girl's face . \nour show's two heroes , the crew's chief , wynt perkins , played laconically by scott glenn , and his second-in-command , jesse graves , played by howie long in a weak attempt to be the next steven seagal , enter the burning house looking for the little girl . \nin a panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames . \nthe manipulative script has her hidden in her own dollhouse . \nthis mawkish show cuts back to monica , who has a life-or-death decision to make . \nthe chopper with the fire-retardant chemicals has only enough to save one group . \nwill it be the large group near the cars or the helpless little girl and monica's two firefighting buddies ? \nshe has only seconds to decide who will be saved . \nyes , she goes for the majority , but , miracle of miracles , the other three come out alive anyway . \nnot content with a traditional firefighting story , chris soth's screenplay attempts to jazz it up by having william forsythe from palookaville play a vicious killer named randy earl shaye who sets a forest fire so that he can join the crew to put it out and then escape . \n ( \" hoods in the woods , \" is what the \" ground-pounders \" yell out when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire . ) \nalong the way , shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by suzy amis , who turns out to have been trained in warrior ways by her father , who was a marine drill instructor . \nmost of the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing . \nhe flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck . \narguably the low point is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside . \nusing a ramp , he shoots straight out of the top of the building's attic , and when he hits the ground , he just rides off in a cloud of dust . \nwhen the film isn't using some stock footage of actual forest fires , the simulated ones look hokey . \neditor jack hofstra cheapens the action even more by his use of burning flames in scene transitions . \nthe ending , with its sick twists , manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie . \nperhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise i heard afterwards in the lobby , \" it's not as bad as some of the television sitcoms . \" \nfirestorm runs mercifully just 1 : 29 . \nit is rated r for violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers . \n", "ever since wargames , the first real computer hacking movie , hollywood has attempted to produce more and more films about hacking . \nthese films usually show the audience a look into computers that really is not impossible and is usually ridiculous . \nif it's not this , the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater than you would expect . \nhackers is guilty of all of these crimes . \nto anyone familiar with computers and/or the internet , most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that you can't take it anymore . \nthose of you who frequent one of the greatest sites on the world wide web , the internet movie database , are probably aware of the section for movies entitled \" goofs \" . \nthis is the section for mistakes in the movies . \nwell , imdb sums up hackers extremely well with the first goof listed : \" generally ill-informed and ridiculous to the extreme regarding the capabilities of computers and technology \" . \nand truthfully , this is one-hundred percent correct . \nthe plot , obviously , centers around computer hacking . \nmore specifically , it follows the exploits of dade murphy , a young computer hacker played by jonny lee miller . \nmiller should be extremely thankful for the film trainspotting , because if it were not for that , who knows where his career would be now after hackers . \nthe film opens with a young dade murphy being arrested for hacking computer systems . \nhe was forbidden to use a computer until he turned eighteen years old . \nthe film then picks up at that point , an eighteen year old dade murphy hacking away at the computer . \ndade later meets up with fellow hackers acid burn ( angelina jolie ) , cereal killer ( matthew lillard ) , lord nikon ( laurence mason ) , and the phantom phreak ( renoly santiago ) , who are basically trying to do what is next to impossible : hack the gibson computer and not get caught by the fbi . \noh , and as a little sub-plot , dade also tries to woo acid burn , the only female hacker in the film . \nreally , i can't think of much more to say about the film's plot aside from what i've said . \nit's just a bunch of computer geeks ( no , obsessive compulsive computer geeks a little too advanced for reality ) running around hacking computers and staying away from the fbi . \nthanks to this movie , the public unfamiliar with computers now has a distorted viewpoint of computers and what they can do . \nthis movie makes computers look a little bit too advanced for their time , and the frivolous suggestions it makes are too many to list . \nto sum it up , hackers is a terrible computer film . \nif you're looking for a film about computers closer to what goes on in the real world , i suggest sneakers . \nalthough at times it too may seem a little far fetched , it should be much more believable than hackers to regular computer users . \nhopefully , this film didn't influence too many young computer users out to think they can do what is portrayed in this 105 minute waste of time . \n", "if there's one thing i just can't stand , it's a film that oozes with sentimentality . \nhere's a note to all film makers : films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves . \nswelling , saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy , and that the situation is hopeless . \nalas , my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up . \nwhat reminded me was that i wasn't choked up , or even the slightest bit moved , for that matter . \nmy giant is a forced , contrived , and conspicuously un-cute ( i detest the word \" cute \" but i've chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a \" cute \" film here ) . \nit takes a premise that might have been interesting ( i liked the preview ) , and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches , all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience . \nmaybe it will work for some people . \nit didn't work for me . \nbilly crystal plays sam cayman , an agent who , at the beginning of the film , is in romania . \nhe's in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing a film . \nthe screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired , get in a car accident , and get saved by an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall . \nhis name is max ( gheorghe muresan ) , and sam thinks he'd be a great movie star because of his size . \nsubplots are as follows : sam has a son and a wife ( kathleen quinlan ) , and he's never around for them , so they move to chicago . \nmax is in love with a woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the film begins . \nsam convinces max to go back to america with him so they can make lots of money , and so their various subplots can all be resolved . \nsam is broke . \nmax is dying . \npass the kleenex . \nmy giant , as a comedy , is only moderately funny . \nit has its moments , the best of which features steven seagal making fun of himself . \nin one great scene , sam gets his son on the phone to talk to seagal ; of course , his son doesn't believe that he's actually speaking to seagal , and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is ( i would quote the line i like but it would probably lose its effect ) . \ncrystal is always entertaining , and he has a few good lines here ( some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely ) ; often , however , he's countered by a slew of jokes that aren't funny , and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes . \nmuresan is kind of fun to watch , but he just can't act very well . \nquinlan , on the other hand , is a great actress who needs to get a role that shows off her talents . \nshe was underused last year in both event horizon and breakdown , but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff . \nhere , the best thing she gets to do is fake a romanian accent . \nall of these disappointing ingredients create a film that , for much of its running time , is simply mediocre . \nas my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion , however , director michael lehmann ( who did a great job directing the underrated hudson hawk ) and scriptwriter david seltzer pile on every cliche imaginable , each one intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings . \nsam's multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed ( how about a main character who has a healthy relationship with his family ? ) . \nlater , it turns out the entire story is supposed to be a great big metaphor signifying sam's reunion with his family . \nand some people might think that what sam does for max towards the end is a valiant thing , but i had a few morality problems with it ( and i apologize for being vague ) . \nit's icky . \nit drips with gooey , wannabe human emotions . \nmy giant could have been a straightforward and funny family film . \nmore importantly , it could have been moving on a level far deeper than it is . \ninstead , it's a complicated , overlong , and under-engaging film that elicits too few laughs and strives for superficial tears . \nand since it left me feeling completely unmoved , i stand by my position that sentimentality is evil and will ultimately destroy the world . \n", "this is not a simple plan about finding a plane load of money and getting away with the cash . \nthis is more about a parable of greed , and how money can become the bane of your life . \nyes , there are elements of ? fargo' here ( the snow and cold ) , although not as vivid in the blood and gore department . \nit shows how greed can set of a chain of events leading to death and the destruction of lives . \nand how at the end of the day , the things that matter most are love , truth and honesty . \nalthough in one sense it may seem tedious , making a movie about the ugliness of greed ( not box office material ) , it does become tedious , not because of the morale ending , but because one expects the movie to end that way . \nthis becomes apparent after the first murder to cover up the crime , the rest of the movie just spirals downward from there . \nthe characters in this drama are a mixture of simple and intellectual folk , brothers and friends , who all fall prey to the avarice of money . \nthey should have perhaps thrown in someone sensible , level headed and not affected by greed to give the party more balance . \ncommendable is the exceptional performance of billy bob thornton , whose portrayal of the simpleton brother was masterful . \nbill paxton also gives a powerful performance as the greedier younger brother , whilst bridget fonda is convincing as the greediest wife , who indirectly causes the most problems . \nfill a room full of greedy people and several million dollars , and you will end up with a simple recipe for a blood bath . \nit's not a simple plan , when you shoot everyone you love for money , unless you're the menendez brothers . \n", "based on the 1960s tv series that i had never seen or heard of before this movie ( be happy , i won't bore you with any lame and unnecessary comparisons ) , this film allows will smith to take a third stab at the independence day weekend box-office , after scoring huge successes with men in black ( 7/10 ) , directed by the same man who controlled this one , and independence day ( 6/10 ) . \ncan you say . . . the \nthird times not a charm ? \nplot : james west and artemus gordon are chosen by the president to find the man responsible for the kidnapping of the nation's top scientists , and threatening to take over the united states within a week . \ncritique : i did not laugh once during this entire picture . \nwhen you consider that this film is a part-comedy , that's not a very good sign . \ni also did not tense up or particularly enjoy any of its unenergetic action sequences which provided me with little more than a few minutes time to think back to the lovely salma hayek scenes . \nwhen you consider that the other \" part \" of this film is geared as an action/adventure , i would say that this another negative sign . \nand when you consider that the first hour of the film was boring and a little slow , the story-line tired , reminiscent of swiss cheese and uninvolving , and the special effects interesting but worth very little inside a plot filled with lame one-liners , weak characterizations and an anti-climactic end , you pretty much have the gist of my impression of this \" big \" summer blockbuster . \nit blows . \nor as they say in french , \" eet blows \" . \ncould it be that the script was crappy because it took four people to write it ? \nmaybe . \ncould it be that most of the special effects don't show up until the last half hour , and even then , we don't see anything that its trailers hadn't already given away ? \nperhaps . \nor could it be that we have come to expect so much more from will smith and hollywood big-budget movies , that we cannot help but evaluate them on a scale onto their own ? \nnaaaaaaah ! \na bad movie is a bad movie . \non a positive note , i could honestly say that i did very much enjoy the lovely performance by the adorable salma hayek , who seemed underused ( in my humble opinion ) , and lit up every bubbly scene that she was hardly in . \nbranagh was also fun as the scenery-munching , over-the-top bad guy , but that's pretty much where the entertainment-buck stopped . \nsmith and kline were static at best , the plot full of holes , and the score insignificant and derivative of a dozen others . \ni would strongly advise anyone not to see this movie . \nthen again , there is that one scene with the lovely salma hayek tied up in a cage . . . huh . . . oh \nyeah , but the rest of the movie sucked . \nlittle known facts about this film and its stars : will smith has starred in two of the ten all-time top grossing films worldwide : 1997's summer blockbuster men in black ( 7/10 ) , for which he also recorded the grammy-winning title song , and 1996's independence day ( 6/10 ) . \nhe once turned down a scholarship to mit to pursue his singing career . \nkevin kline is a graduate of the juilliard school of drama , and has been married to the cute-as-a-button actress phoebe cates since 1989 . \nthey have two kids together , greta simone and owen . \none of the buildings that gets blown up in this film has \" kasdan \" written on it . \nlawrence kasdan is a director known to have worked with kevin on five of his movies , including the big chill , silverado , i love you to death , grand canyon and french kiss . \nsalma hayek gave up a successful career as a major television star in latin america and moved to the united states to start over , even though she spoke no english . \nshe made her feature film debut as an actress with a small role in allison anders' mi vida loca ( no , not the rickie martin video ! ) and played her first starring role in robert rodriguez's desperado opposite antonio banderas . \nsince then , she has made an appearance in each one of rodriguez's films . \nshe stands 5'2 \" , was born in southeast mexico , and the daughter of a lebanese father and a mexican mother . \none of the actresses cast as branagh's lovely but lethal beauties includes bail ling , a stage and screen star in her native china who was last seen starring opposite dick gere in red corner ( 7/10 ) . \nanother is dutch-born frederique van der wal , who is one of the world's most recognized supermodels , having graced the cover of cosmopolitan numerous times , as well as harper's bazaar , vogue and mademoiselle . \n", "in the line of duty is the critically praised series of television movies dealing with the real-life incidents that claimed lives of law enforcement officers in usa . \nthe twilight murders , another one from the series , is dealing with the case of gordon kahl ( played by rod steiger ) , old farmer from north dakota who would rather spend a year in prison than pay taxes to the despised u . s . government . \nafter being released , he still refuses to pay taxes and the warrant is issued for his arrest . \nwhen the u . s . marshals come to arrest him , it turns out that kahl isn't alone . \nmany poor farmers in rural northwest share his extremist anti-government beliefs , and the routine operation turns into shootout that would leave federal officers that . \nthat brings fbi on the scene , and agent mayberly ( michael gross ) is supervising the manhunt . \nhowever , his efforts seem fruitless , since kahl still has many supporters , some of them even in the local law enforcement . \nafter betrayed , 1988 thriller by costa gavras , hollywood mostly ignored the disturbing trends of rising right-wing extremism in the american northwest , and that remained so until oklahoma city bombing , when media hype brought right-wingers back into spotlight . \nuntil that time , only the television movies like this one bothered to pay attention to that phenomenon . \nunfortunately , the twilight murders is still routine and formulaic television film , that uses sensationalist real life content in order to cover lack of originality in the script . \nsometimes , like many american tv movies , it creates drama where drama shouldn't be . \non the other hand , film is steadily directed by dick lowry , and rod steiger does good job potraying gordon kahl . \non the other hand , michael gross as his pursuer is quite wooden and his interaction with some of the actors is terrible . \nhowever , film does deal with potentially thought-provoking social and political issues , so hour and half spent in front of the screen shouldn't be the total waste of time . \n", " * * * the following review contains spoilers * * * \n \" it's just . . . \nthe way . . . \nwe are . \" \n--- a rapist ( matt frewer ) responds to supergirl's ( helen slater ) query as to why she's being attacked , an example of the mind-numbingly bad dialogue in supergirl . \ni'll admit it . . . \ni love superman iii . \ni know it's hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than a vehicle for richard pryor , but i still think it's a worthy addition to the man of steel franchise . \nsupergirl , a spin-off film of sorts from the series' same producers ( alexander and ilya salkind ) , doesn't even rival superman iii in terms of quality , let alone superman or superman ii . \nsupergirl lost me from the opening scenes and went steadily downhill for the rest of its two hour plus running time . \nas the film begins we see the residents of argo city , a commune like place consisting of refugees from krypton which resides in \" inner space \" , go about their daily lives . \nok . . . \nwhat ? \nso these are exiles from krypton , which blew up right ? \nwere they living there before krypton exploded ? \nhow do you get to \" inner space \" ? \nthis whole \" inner space \" notion is never explained , particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world . \nhow do they know where superman went ? \nhow do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet ? \nthese kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me . \nargo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron . \none day the founder of argo city , zaltar ( peter o' toole ) , gives the omegahedron to superman's cousin , kara ( helen slater ) , for use as inspiration in her art . \nkara uses it to create a bug-like thing which immediately crashes through the layer of \" whatever \" that protects the city . \nin the chaos , the omegahedron sails out through the opening , dooming the argonians to death . . . \nin three days time , or something . \nkara then climbs into a pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world . \nthe power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to a minor-league witch named selena ( faye dunaway ) who , immediately before her dip was ruined , announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel ( peter cook ) . \nselena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans , and she sets out to achieve world domination . \nselena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth , and that she's arrived as supergirl ( complete with appropriate costume ) . \nsupergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives . \nok . . . \nhuh ? \nwhy does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake ? \nattention movie : explain yourself ! \ni'm sorry , i can only suspend disbelief so much . \ni can't buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to . \nknowing that she needs a secret identity , supergirl basically \" wills \" herself into a school girl outfit ( complete with a different hairstyle ) , picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school . \nshe's given her dorm assignment , and who happens to be her roommate ? \nlois lane's sister , lucy . \nok , coincidence is one thing folks , but we're getting really contrived now . \nwhat follows are some generic all-girls school hijinks . . . \ncomplete with evil bully girls ( mean for no reason , of course ) and even a shower scene ( ! ) . \nbest moment though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks . \nat this point i'm rapidly wondering why i'm bothering with this nonsense . \nthere is some credit to give to the film however . \none lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an \" evil \" bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its \" prey \" is very well done . \nalso , its commendable to see genders reversed in the film , whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools . \nhart bochner ( die hard ) is particularly fun as kara's love interest , a lovesick landscaper who is under a spell cast by selena ( although he is unfortunately part of one of the film's more ridiculous moments , when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some \" menacing \" bumper cars ) . \nthen there were numerous little things that bothered me . \nthe flying effects are never convincing for a moment . . . \nit's all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wires . \ninstead of having her look like she's flying , the filmmakers wanted her to be \" graceful \" , so she poses a lot and does ballet-type maneuvers . \nalso , who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth ? \na pair of truck drivers/rapists who immediately attack her and then meet a \" wacky \" demise . \nthere is also some rampant product placement in the film , most notably for popeye's , tylenol , and a&w root beer , with the latter actually putting its logo on the t-shirt of one of the rapists ( ? ! ) . \nfinally , just one word : monsters . \nfaye dunaway and peter o'toole ham it up unmercifully , however when o'toole overacts he's entertaining and when dunaway does it she's annoying ( her character actually says the line \" seize them ! \" \nat one point ) . \ndunaway's henchmen ( played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro ) fare much better , with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty's otis character from the first two superman movies . \nhelen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent , naive character she's written to be , as she's able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable . \nbelievability aside though , it's still annoying . \nnow despite all this negativity ( and i'm not alone here . . . supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles ) , leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested , but excited about its release on dvd ! \nthey have released two separate editions of the film on dvd , to the delight of many people ( including myself . . . \nyet i'm still unclear as to why , since this movie is so awful ) . \nthe first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in u . s . theaters . \nthe movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2 . 35 : 1 , is enhanced for 16x9 televisions , and has been remastered in full thx glory . \nextras on the disc include : a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and \" special project consultant \" scott michael bosco , the excellent 50-minute documentary from 1984 called supergirl-the making of a feature ( dig that workout montage ! ) , 5 trailers , 3 tv spots , talent bios , in-depth storyboards ( accompanied by score from the movie ) , and assorted still galleries . \nthe transfer on this international version is incredible . . . \nyou'd think you were watching a new release . \nimages are sharp , colors jump off the screen , and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts . \nonly some special effects sequences show the wear of time , and there just isn't much that can be done about that ( unless you're obsessive like george lucas ) . \nthe new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places , however you'll be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre jerry goldsmith score ( which is completely unrelated to john williams' classic superman theme and sounds better suited for a cannon films' golan-globus production ) . \nthe commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries . \nbosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that there's no dead air on the track . \nbosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen , and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation . \nalthough , at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc , and is surprised when he doesn't get that response . \nwe learn some fascinating tidbits on the track , most notably the \" almost \" appearance in the film by christopher reeve . \ngreat detail is given about superman's proposed role in the original script before reeve ( wisely ) dropped out . \nas it stands , superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission . \nfor the sake of brevity , i won't even get into that one . \nszwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds ( and everyone else agreed ) that supergirl needed to stand on its own , replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy \" whimsical fantasy \" nonsense . \nbosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along , claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been a hit at the box office . \nagain , for the sake of brevity , i won't even get into that one . \nanchor bay has also released a limited edition ( only 50 , 000 copies pressed ) two-disc set . \ndisc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release . \ndisc two features the never before seen director's cut of the film , which runs 138 minutes long . \nthe additions mainly consist of scene extensions which don't add much of note , except for a few moments which lengthen peter o'toole's screen time ( particularly during his latter appearances ) . \nthe print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono , but fans of the film won't care . \none question though . . . \nshouldn't the director's commentary be on the director's cut of the film ? \ni'd never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd . \ni was nine when it was released to theaters , and even then i was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it . \nso when i popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect . \ni knew the film wasn't beloved and i never had any interest in it before , but i was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc . \nas the disc began to spin i was rather impressed with the opening sequence , which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong . \ncome to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo . . . \nso i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started . \nat the end of the film , supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron , and flies back to argo city . \nugh , i give up . \ni'm surprised i even made it to the end of the film not once , not twice , but three times to review these discs . \nsupergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package , but a very lousy movie . \n[pg] \n", " \" practical magic , \" is a film that is so misguided in so many ways that it makes you wonder how such talented and high-profile actors would even get involved in an embarrassing clap-trap like this one . \nthe film stars sandra bullock and nicole kidman as sally and gillian owens , two sisters whose family comes from a long line of witches , spanning back 200 years . \nat the start , their parents die when they are still children , and they go to live with their two zany aunts ( stockard channing and dianne wiest ) . \nswitch to the present day , gillian , who is the stronger , more rebellious sibling , leaves home , and meets up with a dark , abusive guy ( goran visjnic ) , while sally stays in their hometown , meets and falls in love with a sweet , caring man , has two children , and then is devastated when her husband is hit by a truck and killed ( come to think of it , she's not too devastated since she gets over it in about two minutes ) . \nwhen gillian calls sally to come get her after having another abusive spat with visjnic , they accidentally murder him , and in desperation , bury the body in the backyard of their aunts' house . \nadd to this wildly convoluted story subplots involving the dead rising and an exorcism , not to mention a spattering of \" light-hearted whimsy , \" and you have a pretty good idea how messy \" practical magic \" is . \nafter seeing the film , i reflected that there was not even one scene , or element , that i liked or enjoyed . \nit is a comedy , to be sure , but all of the humor falls astoundingly flat , and the occasional dramatic moments are the least bit touching . \nit is not charming or entertaining in any way . \nand then to top it off , we've got this dark , but bird-brained story of an evil spirit taking over gillian's body . \nwhatever . \nthe characters are handled terribly , and actually , most of the actors do not have the fortune of even getting to be what you could call a character . \nthere is no reason why channing and wiest should have decided to be in this film , and in every scene involving them , they are always standing side-by-side . \nno attempt is made to flesh them out into actual people . \nthe same goes for aidan quinn , as a handsome police investigator , who has the misfortune of being the romantic lead opposite bullock , even though he comes into it at around the 70-minute mark , and once again , there is no attempt to develop their relationship , or his character , in any way . \nin fact , every line of dialogue in the film is in service of moving the plot along , rather than getting to know the people saying the lines . \ni should have know i was headed for trouble during the opening credits , when i found out the screenplay was written by the deeply hated akiva goldsman , who managed to destroy the \" batman \" series with \" batman forever \" and \" batman and robin . \" \n \" practical magic \" is directed by griffin dunne , primarily an actor , who last year made the contrived , clumsy romance , \" addicted to love , \" with meg ryan and matthew broderick . \ni disliked that movie quite a bit , but since \" practical magic \" is even worse , that can only give you a taste of what a talentless filmmaker he is . \ni'd tell him to quit while he's ahead , but in these last two years , he's ultimately already buried himself . \n", "nearly every film tim burton has directed has been an homage to the horror genre -- \" frankenweenie , \" \" beetlejuice , \" \" batman , \" \" edward scissorhands , \" \" ed wood , \" \" mars attacks ! \" \n-- yet none of them have been horror films . \n \" sleepy hollow \" is his first attempt to actually scare people . \ni greeted the prospect with high anticipation ; burton's whole career seemed to be leading up to this . \ni left disappointed . \nandrew kevin walker's screenplay takes only the character names from the classic short story \" the legend of sleepy hollow . \" \nin the movie ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is a new york city police constable who is trying to introduce scientific methods of investigation to his superiors . \nichabod is dispatched to the small town of sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders . \nseveral of the town's leading citizens have been decapitated by the headless horseman . \nalthough he rejects the ghost story the town elders tell him , ichabod finds that the facts of the case confound his scientific reasoning . \nhe also discovers that the killings are not random , that the victims are tied together by a secret . \nalong the way ichabod gets help from a bewitching ( literally ) young woman ( christina ricci ) and the son of one of the murder victims ( marc pickering ) . \nmy reaction : ho-hum . \nthe plot is an accumulation of cliches without even the slightest touch of originality to make it interesting . \nthat in itself is forgivable ; hollywood constantly tries to sell us used products in new packages . \nhowever , burton's attempts at inducing fright come off as goofy . \nit might be his background -- in his previous movies , goofy was the goal . \nalong the same lines , it doesn't help that creature designer ( and producer ) kevin yagher has done his best work for the tongue-in-cheek tales from the crypt tv series . \na witch's eyes and tongue shoot out like roger rabbit's , a tree spurts blood like it's in a monty python sketch , and the headless horseman . \n . \n . \nwell , he's a guy without a head . \n . \n . \non a horse ( boo ! ) . \nthe performances are also awful . \nalthough he's impressed me with his work in other films , depp doesn't seem to know what to do with ichabod , and his dialogue is hampered by stilted diction that's supposed to pass for an 18th century accent . \nricci seems to put all her effort into seeming enigmatic , which guarantees that we won't sympathize with her character . \nthe actor who is revealed at the end to be the villain comes off as ridiculously cartoonish . \nthe only pleasure generated by the cast comes from surprise cameos by christopher lee , martin landau , and christopher walken . \ni wonder if this movie was originally conceived as part of francis ford coppola's projected series of gothic adaptations , a series that produced only \" bram stoker's dracula \" and \" mary shelley's frankenstein . \" \ncoppola is an executive producer for \" sleepy hollow , \" and the script reflects his interest in early forms of \" moving pictures , \" particularly in a toy that ichabod carries which blends two

south ever made , and coming from a yankee like me who dislikes the south that's really saying something . \nfor an established , talented director sam raimi is unable to provide any kind of originality to this film . \nit's predictable from the first scene , the screenplay is written like a rip-off of a photocopied bootlegged play . \nyou know that as nasty as the murder suspect is he didn't actually do it . \nit's no surprise either who the real villain turns out to be and what their motive was . \nsigh , how trite . \nfor a supernatural thriller this is neither scary nor intense because it's so cliche . \n \" the gift \" is basically a glorified b-movie . \n", "note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \ni was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 science-fiction flick species . \nsquandering an intriguing premise , the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess , widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike -- and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success , raking in over $60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast ( ben kingsley's a splendid actor , but a marquee name he ain't ) . \nmiraculously dodging the bullet with the first film , i doubted that they'd dare tempt fate and go for another round . \nso here comes species ii , with a new creative team ( director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman , respectively ) that fails to improve the series one iota -- like its predecessor , species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid . \nthe film follows the exploits of a young man , patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women , loitering in strip clubs , and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can . \nin other words , patrick is like a lot of guys ; these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age , but there's a catch -- he's an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars , and who's now infected with alien dna . \npatrick's overriding compulsion : to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring . \nand when he becomes aware of eve ( natasha henstridge ) , a half-human , half-alien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab , patrick's primary focus turns to her -- \" if these two were to mate , the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable \" warns dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , gamely reprising her role ) with admirable conviction . \nspecies ii opens with the mars mission , and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokey-looking , even splicing back to dated , grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities -- they really skimped on production values this time around . \nhowever , this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick ; watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship , any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy b-movie is quickly answered . \nmr . brancato's original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches . \nlike the first film ( and perhaps in homage to it ) , there's a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious . \nlast time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitaker's psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room -- \" something bad happened here . \" \nthis time , laura gets to stand over a fresh , shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter \" this is awful . \" \nand she's not even empathic ! \nand when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a woefully-paced suspense sequence , eve , who's telepathically linked to her alien/human-hybrid counterpart ( whatever ) , helpfully tells our alien-hunting protagonists , \" he's going to rape her . \" \nwhile species ii is often unintentionally hilarious , at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own . \nthere's an amusing , tongue-in-cheek bit of product placement ( which doesn't really make much sense , but i appreciated the sentiment ) , as well as some supermarket-related hijinx ( \" he's in aisle 1 ! \" \ninforms eve ) . \nif the film maintained this sort of light-hearted tone , it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch , but , to its detriment , it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to a bloody , effects-ladened anticlimactic conclusion . \nmuch of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense , and there are such gaping plot holes that it's terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief . \nthe implausibilities are endless : what about the toxic bomb in eve's brain ? \nwhy are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual ? \nmy favourite was the slow-motion sequence in the film where eve , sporting superhuman strength , is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks . \nthis is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief , incredulous that it's being foisted upon the public . \nreturning headlines michael madsen ( who reprises tough guy press lennox ) and ms . helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay , but there's realistically only so much one can do with this script as a basis . \nmykelti williamson ( portraying astronaut dennis gamble ) churns out an all-too-familiar spin on a generic brash-mouthed character , and fine character actors george dzundza ( playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process ) and james cromwell ( patrick's neglectful father , senator ross ) are utterly wasted in the film . \nmr . lazard gives his character an appropriately shifty-eyed look , while returning vixen ms . henstridge is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene ( and acquits herself nicely ) , but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing ( or none at all ) . \nms . henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series , claiming that \" she's so empowered . \" \na lethal half-alien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion -- now * that's * what i call empowerment . \n", "the sequel to the fugitive ( 1993 ) , u . s marshals is an average thriller using it's association with the fugitive just so it can make a few extra bucks . \ntommy lee jones returns to his role as chief deputy samuel gerard , the grizzly cop who was after harrison ford in the fugitive . \nthis time , he's after fugitive mark sheridan ( snipes ) who the police think killed two fbi agents , but of course he's been set up , and when the police plane escort he ( and gerard ) are riding crashes , he makes a run for it , gerard not so hot on his tail . \nwhat follows is about 2 hours of action , brought to us by the director of executive decision ( 1995 ) , another film curiously involving a plane . \nwhen comparing this movie to the fugitive , the prequel is far superior . \nbut even on it's own , u . s marshals is a pretty lousy movie . \nwhile the original was reasonably intelligent , and had a fugitive to root for , the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive , mainly because we know so little about him until way into the film's overlong running time . \nwhile the fugitive gave a little time to develop harrison fords character , u . s marshals is straight in there , pulling it's trump card ( the place crash ) almost immediately . \nto be honest , i couldn't care less if snipe's character got captured or not . \nsnipes performance is average , and his character gets surprisingly little screen time ( considering he is the fugitive ) for reasons i'll explain later . \ntommy lee jones is as fine as ever , although his role is hardly a challenge . \nthe sense of deja vu was overwhelming . \ni know it's the same role from the fugitive , but there is seemingly no attempt to develop his character from the last film . \nthere's a few 'nudge nudge' references from the first film , but apart from that , nothing . \nnobody even mentions harrison ford in this movie . \ndowney jnr is ok as fbi agent john royce who's roped into the chase , and sexy french actress irene jacob wanders in and out of the movie as snipes wife . \nnobody looks as if their having a good time , and all the performers are on autopilot . \nthe supporting cast are o . k , but when it comes to performances , u . s marshals falls flat on it's face . \nit doesn't fare any better plot-wise , either . \nthe film starts off with gerard trying to capture snipes , but then veers off into terrorists territory . \nas said above , the film is an normal , average terrorist thriller , seen a million times before , but is using the fugitive reputation to make it sound more professional . \nif this film wasn't the 'sequel' to the fugitive , this would probably go straight to video , or not even been made at all , because it's so average . \nand because of the film's plot changing it's course , snipes is almost forgotten apart , and hardly features in the movie . \nstuart baird , the director , is all right , but there's no particular scene that stands out . \nit's director is the usual action movie style . \neven the plane crash is sorely lacking in tension . \nthe special effects are nice , especially the plane crash , and there's a good ( if very loud ) soundtrack by veteran composer jerry goldsmith . \nbut in the end , u . s marshals suffers from an overwhelmingly lack of excitement . \nsure , it's loud and dumb , but in the end u . s marshals just ain't fun . \nbored performers and a lackluster plot and script , do not make a good action movie . \noverall rating= review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities \n", "one of the contributors to the destruction of the batman film franchise chris o'donnell stars in this remake of buster keaton's 1925 silent film seven chances . \nnow i've never seen seven chances , as i'm more of a chaplin fan than a keaton fan , but i seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this . \no'donnell plays jimmie shannon , the manager of a pool table manufacturing company . \nhe also fears commitment , and despite dating anne ( renee zellweger ) for over three years , he's unwilling to marry her . \nhis reasons ? \nwell he's a guy you see , and well , guys are like stallions , and they apparently don't like to be roped or something ( hey , that's the movie's explanation . . . \ni'd marry renee zellweger in a second ) . \neventually it comes time for jimmie to propose , and when he does , it's the most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever . \nhe essentially says to her , \" you win \" and hands her a ring . \nthe audience should now hate this character . \ni did . \nthen the meat of the plot presents itself . \njimmie's grandfather ( peter ustinov , completely wasted ) dies and leaves jimmie his entire estate of 100 million dollars as well as ownership of the pool table business . \nhowever , in order to get the money and save the jobs of the factory workers , jimmie must be married before his next birthday ( which is just over 24 hours away ) . \nhaving blown his chances with anne , jimmie proceeds to track down all his prior girlfriends and suggest a \" business proposition \" . \nthe movie wasn't half bad by this time , surprisingly . \nit wasn't boring me , and even managed to read my thoughts at one point . \nustinov's character left a video will , and while he's reading the ridiculous clause in it , i thought to myself \" what is this , brewster's millions ? \" . \nas soon as i thought it , hal holbrook's character actually says \" what is this , brewster's millions ? \" \nit was quite surreal . \nsomething happens though during the film's final act that caused me to sharply drop the rating it was going to receive . \nup to that point , all of jimmie's prior girlfriends had turned down his \" business proposition \" which i felt was good . \nat least the film wasn't painting women to be cold hearted gold diggers . \nwhen jimmie has no other options , his goofy friend ( played by artie lange , making a career out of playing the goofy friend ) places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes a front page story . \nat this point , 100 , 000 women don wedding gowns and head off to persuade jimmie to pick them to be his bride . \nthese women arrive at jimmie's location and immediately start bullying him about what he's looking for in a woman . \nwhen he's had enough of their unjustified attacks , he tells the angry mob that there's been a mistake and he won't be marrying any of them . \nas a result , the women proceed to chase him around the city , in hopes of catching him and tearing his limbs off . \nthis goes on for the rest of the film . \nit's just chris o'donnell running from 100 , 000 obnoxious , greedy , angry and stupid women . \nmy groans of disgust could be heard for miles . \nthe film finally ended ( thankfully ) , but to this day i'm still groaning . \nthe bachelor is available on dvd from new line home video . \nit contains the film in both full frame and in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , cast and crew info , and special dvd-rom features . \nthe original theatrical trailer is also on the disc , which contains scenes not in the film . \napparently there was even more footage of the gang of brides chasing o'donnell around the city , and at one point o'donnell is leaping from the tops of buses . \nso that was bad enough to be cut , but the other 30 minutes of bride shenanigans was good ? \nugh . \n", "the happy bastard's quick movie review \nholy man \nmore like holy

their hands . \nsomehow he ends up in their car and on their channel , a line-up of infomercial programs featuring the likes of betty white , morgan fairchild , and a slew of other celebrities and nameless figures . \nit's here that he seems to hit his stride , speaking of life instead and somehow boosting sales . \nat this point in the movie , of course , morality comes into play , particularly on goldblum , who suddenly feels he can market the magical g into megabucks to get in good with his boss ( robert loggia ) . \nit doesn't take long for the movie to unfold into sappy mush , with realizations taking place left and right and poor plot points . \nonly a real zippy sequence involving frying morgan fairchild's face seems to have any interest in the movie . \nmurphy lends nothing to his character and poor goldblum looks as if he'd rather be someplace else . \nsome may argue that the movie has a message , but all that came across to me is that i could probably get more entertainment watching that informercial with the guy in the question mark coat . \nat least he has something for us to laught at . . . \n", "forget get carter . \ninstead . . . \nget me a cup of coffee . \nwhat the hell has happened to all good american action movies ? \ndid i unknowingly miss a meeting somewhere ? \nwhen did all of the bad-ass , kicking butt and taking names , gun-toting , crazed , vengeful characters of the 1980's -- from such films as commando , cobra , predator , raw deal , first blood -- suddenly turn into innocent , compassionate , sensitive , teary-eyed knuckleheads . \nthe only place to turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east -- and i don't mean new york city . \nget carter -- the latest masterpiece from uber-thespian sylvester stallone -- is a prime example of large and in charge 80's action stars trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown . \nstallone seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up . \na few years ago , stallone made a movie that gave him the opportunity to gracefully exit the roles that typecast him as an action monkey . \nthat role was sheriff freddy heflin in copland -- a strange film about redemption within a broken soul . \nstallone actually gave an amazing performance and it seemed he had shaken off the past . \ntoo bad get carter returns stallone to action , but with the shiny paint rusted off on the edges . \nget carter is a simple story . \nstallone plays frank carter , a vegas bruiser for a loan shark ( played with amazing gusto by the uncredited voice of actor tom sizemore ) . \nwhen frank's brother gets himself killed in a drunk driving accident , frank , feeling all guilty and mushy inside , thinks foul play is involved and travels to seattle to set right all the wrongs with the patented \" carter's way \" . \nhe talks tough with his brother's wife , lends a helping had to his brother's daughter doreen ( rachel leigh cook ) , and walks around seattle in the pouring rain dressed like a lost member of the rat pack with a really bad goatee . \ncarter finds out that his brother was involved in some bad stuff with a slimy porn king played by ultra-cool , mcqueen-esque mickey rourke , a multi-millionaire computer geek ( alan cumming ) , and a strange foreign guy ( michael caine ) who speaks in riddles and talks tough . \ncarter stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did in his brother and how to extract proper revenge on the responsible parties . \nwhat a minute ! \nthis sounds just like another film i saw last year , the limey . \nbetter not tell terence stamp about stallone ripping him off . \nactually , get carter is a remake of the 1971 british production of the same name , starring caine in the title role ( and what with his cameo here , the cleverness is astonishing ) . \nwhile stallone still carries his own weight here , the movie lacks what the original did as well : purpose . \nthroughout the film , stallone looks like an old guy trying to act tough , while nobody is taking him seriously . \nhis one-liners fall flat , and he seems tired and uncertain of all the actions , mental and physical , required of his character . \nthere is even a strange homoeroticism between rourke and stallone that lends a bizarre tone to their numerous conversations -- in both fists and words . \nthe biggest surprise in get carter is that the best job done in the film is by the versatile mickey rourke . \nan amazing method actor in the eighties who fell into drugs , spousal abuse , a boxing career , and an intolerable attitude towards not getting his way , rourke still brings a dangerous sense of purpose to his porn king character . \nhe may not win any oscars , but he still ranks highly in my book . \nget carter has great directing , strong acting by rourke and caine , and energetic car chases that would make william friedkin proud . \nthe only thing it lacks - as with most hollywood productions -- is a good script and proper casting . \nnever mind that it should never have been made at all . \n", "a remake of the 1978 warren beatty vehicle \" heaven can wait \" ( which in turn was a remake of \" here comes mr . jordan \" ) , \" down to earth \" tells the tale of lance barton ( chris rock , \" lethal weapon iv

his only recourse is to return in another body . \nhe chooses that of charles wellington , the tenth richest man in the united states . \nof course , wellington is not only rich , but white and 53 years old , which makes lance's bid for closing night at the apollo , as well as his desire to woo suntee ( regina taylor , \" jerry maguire \" ) , a tad tricky . \nthe original elaine may/warren beatty script has been reworked by chris rock , lance crouther , ali leroi , and louis c . k . \nto turn beatty's vehicle as a football player into rock's vehicle as a comic and add some racial humor . \nas directed by chris weitz and paul weitz ( codirectors of \" american pie \" and costars of \" chuck & buck \" ) , the whole affair comes off as amateur hour . \ninitial scenes play like filmed line reading rehearsals . \nproduction values are shoddy . \nmost serious of all is the use of rock when his wellington counterpart would have been more appropriate . \nthis problem is clearly attributable to the fact that the old white guy is never lip or action synched when he is on screen . \nrock does get the chance to do some fun schtick , such as his turnaround on wellington's plans for a poor neighborhood hospital ( 'bullet in the head ? \nyou got a bed ! ' ) , but he's uneven when interacting with the rest of the cast . \nregina taylor fares well amidst the mediocrity as the young activist who confusedly ends up falling for the man she believed to be her nemesis . \nalso good is frankie faison ( \" hannibal \" ) as whitney , lance's compassionate manager - the only human who's made privy to lance's body body switch . \nchaz palminteri and levy are pretty much wasted as heaven's ambassadors . \nanother \" best in show \" alumnus , jennifer coolidge , is poorly used as wellington's cheating wife ( and shown several days apart wearing the same

underutilized as cisco , wellington's fake english butler . \nstealing the show in every scene she's in is wanda sykes ( \" the chris rock show \" ) as wellington's disgruntled maid . \n \" down to

possibilities brought about by rendering oneself invisible , in \" hollow man \" kevin bacon's character opts to commit sex crimes . \ner , it's kevin bacon who plays the super smart military bio-molecular research scientist ? \nsomething sounds horribly wrong already . \nbut this is a paul verhoeven film , and the sleazepin director of such open-crotch classics as \" basic instinct \" and the infamous \" showgirls \" never lets a little credibility get in the way of his voyeuristic tendencies which , when you come right down to it , is all this film is about . \n \" hollow man \" features a string of hapless , c-list actors ( among them bacon , elisabeth shue , josh brolin , and kim dickens ) in a grade-z plot with a lot of special effects that , frankly , don't look much better than those used in the 1933 version of \" the invisible man . \" \noh bacon glistens when he gets wet all right and looks like a rather fatty side of cheap flank steak when he's attempting reentry but otherwise it's lots of \" thermal \" shots and inanimate objects ( elisabeth shue included ) bobbing around without any visible signs of support . \nsince invisibility , once achieved , isn't much of an effect ( the actors spend half their time conversing with nobody and the other half of their time talking to each other--it amounts to much of a muchness ) , the director elects to wardrobe all of his female protagonists in loosely-buttoned sweaters so that the minute bacon's character gets invisible he can head straight for them . \nit's as if that fascinating concept--what would you do if no one could see you ? --is \nsimply a verhoeven ploy to show some skin . \nas a horror film , \" hollow man \" is unsophisticated and disturbing ( in its intent , not its achievements ) and not worth your time or your hard-earned dollars . \nit's minor verhoeven--and even that's not saying much--and boy is it hollow . \n", "roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast , \" who

dark , henry fonda in once upon a time in the west , or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it . \nthey should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild , sympathetic , or even ineffectual character roles . \nthe same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious . \nthat is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast . \ngary \" gal \" dove ( played by ray winstone ) has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain . \nlife has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing . \nbut his paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch . \nthe first

have been caught before filming . \nwhen we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success . \nbeyond an ability to use skin-diving gear , no special talents are required of him . \nany local hood could have done what gal is needed for . \nadditionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault , flooding the vault . \nno only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether , but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool . \nin spite of the provocative title , the story is

reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout . \nhis style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences . \ncinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit

new to british crime films , but it would be overly familiar as a western . \nfurther respectability comes from ben kingsley's high-powered performance . \ni give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0

beautifully structured pocahontas and the dashing captain john smith can prevent a terrible clash . \nthe ending , as it turns out , is not entirely a happy one and is one of the film's finer moments . \nthe characters are mixtures of stereotypes and lack any real depth . \ngovernor ratcliffe , for instance , is a snobbish , single-minded bore whose mere appearance is supposed to bring about hisses . \ncaptain john smith is a blond hunk who , while \" slightly \" misguided , is good at heart . \npocahontas herself is the typical disney heroine who is practically being forced to marry a man who everyone but her likes and finds the man of her dreams just in time . \nshe even comes complete with insignificant best friend . \nagain , against tradition , talking animals aren't used , but a lusty , wizened , talking tree is . \nthis is an odd compromise , but it's one of the few elements that really work . \nthe animals are a delight , and what brief time their interactions take place brings the only humor and fun to a rather bland presentation . \nmaybe it would have been a better film if we saw the story unfold through their eyes . \nthe talking tree , who seems to have a thing for john smith , is the only other character that can hold our interest and is perhaps the best developed of the bunch . \nthe music , a welcome delight in the later disney films , is mostly a let down here , with the exception of the catchy and motivational , \" colors of the wind . \" \nmel gibson , as the voice of john smith , has a solid singing voice and should have been used more . \nthe opposite holds true for the governor ratcliffe led songs ; the singing is even more grating than his simplistic character . \ni was rather bored through what turned out to be a shorter than expected running time . \neven the children in the audience seemed restless . \nwhile there's no stopping a kid from seeing something that they want--or disney wants them to--most i believe will be disappointed . \nperhaps the biggest problem is that disney has strayed from their familiar fable and fairy tale themes to history . \nit's all right to change or embellish fantasy to suit a movie's entertainment value , but doing so to historical facts doesn't work nearly as well as creating nagging questions in the viewer's minds and plot holes that are never filled . \neven the artwork , another disney strong point , varies greatly in quality , making any story problems even more obvious . \nas mentioned above , there were many questions that stayed with me while viewing the film . \nfor instance , if john smith was truly such a world traveler and had so much experience with \" savages , \" why did he so quickly change his previous \" kill as many indians as i can \" attitude . \nif he was such a nice guy after all , he should have changed his ways long before this . \nor how about pocahontas' amazing english speaking ability when this had supposedly been the first time she had seen white men ? \ni can understand making the native americans speak english for the benefit of the audience , but simply saying that they had met a missionary years earlier would have cleared up a lot ; history was modified in the film anyway . \nas it is , i wonder if it doesn't give kids the wrong impression . \nin short , the film is too simplistic for adults and contains too much romance and not enough action or humor for the younger set . \nwhile disney tried valiantly in many ways to break with some of their firmest traditions , they end up failing on too many levels . \n", "plot : upon the realization that they are failing all of their classes , two roommates try to find a third roomie who will kill himself , since the school's charter automatically grants top grades to the roommates of any student who succeeds in suicide . \ncritique : despite this film's interesting premise and dark subject matter , this movie sucks because it is unfunny , boring , and presents us with one of tom everett scott's worst acting performances . \nadd that to a completely unsuccessful romance element , many lame and corny jokes , a long wait for the setup , and an ending that takes all the blackness out of this \" black comedy \" ( if you're gonna create a black comedy , don't chicken out in the end-see very bad things ( 8/10 ) for a perfect example ) , and you've got yourself a trite mtv creation worthy of its own subject matter . \ni barely laughed at any gags , found the bong element contrived and repetitive , and was horrified not to find any gratuitous nudity tossed anywhere in this movie ( if you're gonna make a bad college comedy , at least slap in some free t&a shots for the kids : ) . \nthis one's not even worth the rental , fellas . \nskip it altogether ! \nlittle known facts about this film and its stars : during auditions for that thing you do ! , tom everett scott's first feature film role , director tom hanks was opposed to hiring tom because of the fact that scott could've passed for hanks 15 years ago . \nit wasn't until hanks' wife rita wilson saw the audition tape , and decided he was cute , that hanks decided to risk hiring scott . \nthe actor who played scott cooper in this film , mark-paul gosselaar , is best known for having played the character of zack morris on tv's \" saved by the bell \" . \nhis parents are dutch and named hans and paula . \nand who would've guessed that this is director alan cohn's first shot at directing a feature film ? \n", "when respecting a director , you must also respect the fact that they are not perfect . \nwoody allen has made a couple less-than good films , and he's my favorite . \neven martin scorsese hasn't had a perfect track record . \nkevin smith , after a smashing debut with the classic \" clerks \" stooped as low to sell-out and make the dreadful \" mallrats . \" \ni mean , so far the only director who's made several films , none of which have been bad is richard linklater ( \" slacker , \" \" dazed and confused , \" \" before sunrise , \" and \" suburbia \" . . . all \nwhich were great ) . \nnow , i adore quentin tarantino . \nhis first two films were classic films , the second one being one of the greatest films of all time . \nbut 1995 just wasn't that good of a year for him . \nhe made way too many tv appearances . \nhe mispronounced jackie chan's name on the mtv movie awards . \nand he made this film . \n ( he was also awarded an oscar , so i guess that would be a grand exception ) . \nrobert rodriguez is also a great director ; not a brilliant one , but a cool one . \ni've never seen an alexandre rockwell or allison anders film , so i can't comment on them . \nbut in this crap ensemble director's film , all four give pitiful efforts . \npitiful for any director , too . \nnow in all fairness , ensemble director pieces never really work out . \ni've never seen all of \" new york stories , \" but have heard the first two films , by scorsese and francis ford coppola are crap ( i saw woody's one , which was hilarious but not totally up to par ) . but i will rate each film individually and then report back to you on the overal average score of the film . \nexposition : a simple one - a bellhop , ted ( the totally overdone tim roth , who's a god and all , but not in this one , though he has a couple good moments ) is working on new year's eve for his first shift ( ! ! ! ) in an old fancy hotel . \nhe's the only one there ( again : ! ! ! ) and he only has a couple rooms ( yet again : ! ! ! ) . \nthe old bellhop ( the seemingly immortal marc lawrence - who hated pulp fiction actually ) hands over his cap to ted and he goes to his job happily . \nas the night goes on , he becomes increasingly annoyed and hostile . \nyea . \n ( the short films are presented in order , btw ) : \nthe missing ingredient writer/director : allison anders starring : sammi davis , amanda decadenet , valeria golino , madonna , ione skye , lili taylor , alicia witt \nthis one starts it off horribly with no plot , no intrigue , and crap dialogue . \nthe situation is so terrible that it's physically painful to watch . \nthe plot has something to do with a coven of witches needing sperm to bring back a godess who is ( gasp ! ) \nstuck inside some object in their hotel room . \nthe witch that was supposed to bring it ( ione skye ) calls up ted and asks him if she can perform fellatio on him to get it . \nyeah , that's what i said . \nstupid plot , inane characters who aren't interesting at all , etc , etc , etc . the only good thing about this is it has a good cast which , in turn , it wastes pitifully . \nnot even actually funny for a second . \nmy rating ( out of 5 ) : no stars ! ! ! ! \nthe wrong man writer/director : alexandre rockwell starring : david proval , jennifer beals and laurence bender \nanother bad little film with another stupid sex thing going on . \nted stumbles into the wrong room or something and gets in the middle of a couple ( david proval and jennifer beals in her attempt at \" coming back \" ) who are playing sex games . \nted tries to escape and we cheer him on so it will end soon . \nbut at least this has a bit of comedy in it , just not that much . \nand david proval has never overacted as much . \nand it's \" pulp fiction \" producer laurence bender who gets to puke from a window . \na masterpiece compared to the first one , but still . . . \nthe misbehavers writer/director : robert rodriguez starring : antonio banderes , tamlyn tomita , lana mckissack , danny verduzco , salma hayek \nwould a robert rodriguez film be the same without salma hayek's navel ? \nnope . \nluckily she's on the tv dancing so we get to see her . \nsurprisingly enough , when i read the screenplay ( about a year before actually seeing it ) , this one seemed to have the most potential . \nit was fast-paced , funny , and well , funny . \nbut when i watched it , it seemed anti-climactic and only seemed to gain any momentum towards the end when everything happened at once . \nantonio overacts nicely and the two kids ( lana and danny ) are funny . \nbut , as i said , it moves slowly and in that way , it's more painful than funny . \nbut the ending was stupid and funny at the same time . \noh ! \nthe plot : antonio is a supposed gangster ( assumed , really ) who leaves his two troubling kids home while he and his wife ( tomita ) go out to get drunk at a new year's party . \nantonio hires ted for a couple bucks to watch his kids all night long , but things go wrong . . . it \nwas okay . \nthe man from hollywood writer/director : quentin tarantino starring : quentin tarantino , bruce willis , paul calderon and jennifer beals ( again ) \nironically , this one could be considered the best for a bad reason : it best represents what quentin has done with this film . \nhe plays chester , a spoiled brat actor or something who has just had a huge box-office hit on his hands and is living it up by playing an anti-climactic game from a hitchcock tv episode starring steve mcqueen and peter lorre where they gamble to see if one of them can get light from his lighter ten times in a row . \nthey're drunk and need sober but nervous ted to hold the cleaver and bring it down if the lighter doesn't light . \nthey also pay him a lot of cash . \nthis is so much exactly what this little film is about that it's campy . \ntim roth was probably payed a lot of money to do this stupid part in this stupid film made by a bunch of people who are high on themselves 'cause they've had hits , major or minor . \nit took quentin to realize that . \nbut the thing is , it doesn't seem like he realizes that . \nif he did , i'd give this a good 3 stars . \nbut this sucked . \nit was anti-climactic and the dialogue wasn't very good . \nhe starts off with a very long steadicam shot then goes to flashes . \nthat makes no sense . \nit's cool for a while , then he makes it uneven . \nit's long and it's just not very good . \nhopefully quentin never repeats what he did with this one . \nconclusion : what's the moral here ? \nif you've made celebrated films , don't do an ensemble piece . \nthey should have re-watched \" new york stories \" and then stopped in their tracks . \nnone of these have any point to them and they're embarrassing to not only the writer/directors , but to the actors 'cause they're working with crap . \nbut i will forgive everyone involved and i especially look forward to quentin's next directing job ( even though he and rodriguez jumped back to the top immeadiately with the cool \" from dusk till dawn , \" which i found exhilerating ) . \ni love quentin and i suppose it's good he made \" the man from hollywood \" because it makes him seem more realistic and not some \" god of cinema . \" \ni seem to respect directors if they aren't \" gods \" and are actually human beings who make mistakes . \n \" the man from hollywood \" is his big mistake and let's hope he doesn't return her continuously . \n", "you don't need to have seen the original \" species \" to appreciate how utterly lousy \" species ii \" is . \nwith few exceptions , sequels tend to be worse than the films that spawned them , but the fact that \" species ii \" is a follow-up isn't the only reason it's so miserable . \nit's the predictable storyline , the cardboard characters , the banal dialogue , the failed attempts at humor , the revolting special effects , the gratuitous nudity ( all female , of course ) , the bad acting , and the bland direction . \nthe plot , simply geared at getting the alien species back on planet earth so that it can reak some more havoc , involves three astronauts landing on mars and inadvertently bringing some alien slime in a soil sample back aboard their shuttle . \nthe slime , well , sort of jumps out at them and the screen turns black . \nthat should have been the end of the movie right there . \nback on terra firma , at least one of the crew is now a carrier of alien dna and , as you'll remember if you saw the first movie , driven by a strong urge to procreate . \non a parallel track , government scientists have cloned a version of sil from the first film ( now called eve , again \" played \" by natasha henstridge ) and are keeping her around for some testing . \nthis , apparently , includes observing eve's reaction to \" the dukes of hazzard \" tv show , which she appears to enjoy . \neve's bio-rhythms go off the scale each time one of her kinfolk \" mates , \" which we are forced to witness in gross-out detail , but otherwise there doesn't appear to be a whole lot of reason why henstridge is in this film , unless it was written into her contract ( let's hope it cited one sequel and one sequel only ) . \neve finally breaks free of her confines--and her bra--for the finale , but the effects are so messy you can't really see what's going on . \npeter boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams \" i told 'em not to go ! \" \nat the top of his lungs , referring to the mars mission but more likely aimed at the makers of this piffle . \nmichael madsen reprises his role of press lennox ( so that he can enter high security areas , flash a badge and claim to be press , maybe ? ) , as does marg helgenberger as dr . laura baker , the one subjecting eve to the tv reruns . \nthey're both unbelievably wooden . \nwhat's a talented filmmaker like peter medak ( \" the ruling class , \" \" the krays , \" \" let him have it \" ) doing directing this tripe , i wonder . \nit's an unfortunate trend , this : once-talented directors throwing in the towel and lending their names to unchallenging horror flicks like \" species ii . \" \nlast year peter hyams gave us \" the relic \" ; no thanks necessary there . \nand the first \" species \" was helmed by roger donaldson who , although certainly no genius behind the camera , had demonstrated much better judgment with his previous choice of projects . \nis it just that there are no better offers out there ? \n \" species ii \" is worthless . \nworse than that , it's also exploitative , offensive , and insulting to the intelligence at every turn . \nit's not that there isn't anything positive to say about the film . \nthere is . \nafter 92 minutes , it ends . \n", " \" something is fishy in the state of universal . \" \nabout ten years back , with the unexpected success of mad max and the road warrior , post-apocalypse nitty-gritty survival yarns became popular at the movies . \nwe've always had movies of this nature ; on the beach , the end of the world , damnation alley , the ultimate warrior , and so on . \nto date , the most smoothly done were straightforward \" haircuts \" of the classic western plot , like the lone gunman who comes to town and protects the widow and the son against an evil organization , usually one in possession of some critical resource , like water , feed range , or a mining claim . \nmost of these grew out of venerable , but solid hero yarns like the virginian and shane . \n ( my personal favorite is a patrick swayze movie called steel dawn , which was fairly well made on a small budget . ) \nnow we have waterworld , which again brings the traditional lone gunman to town to rescue the young widow and her daughter . \n ( well , she's not a widow , and the kid isn't her daughter , but you get the idea . ) \nthe lady is helen , played by the stunning jean tripplehorn , who isn't given a chance to be stunning , or even interesting , by the mediocre and unimaginative script . \nthe child enola , played by tina majorino , is living proof that a child actor need not be a bad thing to have in a movie ; she outshines her material all the way through . \nin simple , the scene is earth , hundreds of years from now . \nthe polar ice caps have melted , and somehow produced enough water to inundate the entire planet . \nthe few remaining people live in boats and floating colonies , and survive by trade , theft , or piracy . \nsomehow an oil tanker has survived the centuries , and its inhabitants , called \" smokers , \" are able to keep gasoline engines running despite the dearth of replacement parts and raw materials , so the bad guys have outboard engines , and fast-moving boats , airplanes , and jet skis . \nenola , found at sea as a young girl , has a mysterious map no one can read tattooed on her back . \nwe suspect early on that it is the way to the mythical \" dryland , \" the place where trees , crops , and animals grow , and what plot there is hinges on who has enola . \nthe psycho ruler of the smokers , the \" deacon , \" is trying to get her and find his way to dryland . \nplayed with typical self-lampooning , rug-chewing histrionics by dennis hopper , \" deacon \" is the only thing in the movie that's close to amusing . \nhis performance is * almost * laughable , but there just isn't enough there to be funny . \nthe star ( and a co-producer ) is kevin costner . \nhe's playing an un-named lone denizen of the sea , a man called the \" mariner , \" who turns out to be a gilled , water-breathing mutant with webbed feet . \nvery little is done with this . \nthe script ignores the ineffectuality of gills in supplying enough oxygen to support a human metabolism ; it ignores the fact that even with both ice caps completely melted , much of the earth's surface would still be above water ; and it ignores the blatant impossibility of the cultures and technology shown . \n ( canned meat does * not * last for centuries ; ammunition does * not * fire after it's more than a few decades old ; and so on , and so on . . . ) \ni'm quite fond of tina majorino's previous work , very impressed by jean tripplehorn's past accomplishments , and still speechless over costner's dances with wolves . \nbut this movie could destroy the careers of anyone associated with it ! \nthis movie cost one hundred and eighty-two million dollars , and there's * nothing * in it we haven't seen before , done better on only a few percent of the cost of this turkey . \nat 125 minutes of material , this movie cost over one point four million dollars per minute to make . \nthe budget of this movie * could * have given us over thirty movies ; it could have paid for six years of a prime-time sf tv series with expensive fx work , or ten years of an sf tv series with good digital fx . \nin sum , this movie is beneath contempt . \nit has nothing new to offer , it has a script that could easily have been bettered by the people who write comic books for dc , and it spent more money than the national budget of a small nation . \nif you * have * to go see it , see it on a four-dollar matinee . \notherwise you'll find yourself sneering at you every time you pass a reflective surface , for weeks . \n", "this season needs another serial killer movie like kathie lee gifford needs more public devastation . \nbut lo and behold , here comes \" switchback , \" and fast on the heels of such stalker fare as \" kiss the girls \" and \" i know what you did last summer . \" \nbut \" switchback \" is an undoubtedly weak genre entry , as the material it covers is old and tired , and the filmmakers rarely sustain enough energy to make any of the proceedings interesting . \n \" switchback \" opens with the murder of a babysitter and the abduction of the young child she's watching . \nwe learn late in the game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse ( dennis quaid ) , and that the kidnapper/killer is a nameless fiend that lacrosse has been tracking across the country for quite a while . \nhe is promptly removed from the case , but this conflict of interest doesn't keep him from offering pursuit . \nlacrosse's most recent trek takes him to a blood-soaked hotel room in amarillo , texas , where the local sheriff ( r . lee ermey ) is torn between his re-election campaign and helping his new ally catch his man . \nin a related aside , former railway worker bob goodall ( danny glover ) is cruising through the snowbound west in his pinup-plastered ( even on the seatbelts ) el dorado . \nalong the way , he picks up -- and subsequently saves the life of -- hitchhiking loner lane dixon ( jared leto ) . \nthis tangent isn't a random one , as bob or lane will end up either holding a piece of the puzzle or turn out to be the killer himself . \nor is the villain in fact lacrosse , only pretending to be after the cold-hearted murderer he knows so much about . \nin a sense , that's half of the basic problem with \" switchback . \" \nfor its first hour , the movie presents evidence that any of these three men could be the perpetrator , so we're given little insight into who they are , likely for fear that we'll learn too much too fast and therefore be able to make the proper deduction . \nbut \" switchback \" then decides to explicitly reveal the killer's identity at its midpoint , and the following contradictory character motivations muddle both the pacing and the generation of suspense . \nsome of the acting is a burdensome area as well , probably because the performers were instructed to build personas that are the exact opposite of their true selves . \nwhat is danny glover doing here , grinning and yeehawing his way through the messy plot ? \nand dennis quaid ? \n ( that monotone -- stop it ! ) \nermey is solid in a supporting role that's more interesting than the two leads thrown together , but the charismatic leto ( claire danes' object of affection in \" my so-called life \" ) is a scene-stealer tried and true . \n>from a material standpoint , \" switchback \" is pretty empty . \nbut even when first-time director jeb stuart ( who wrote \" the fugitive \" and \" die hard \" ) doesn't know what to do , he knows what he wants it to look like -- the movie provides some great visuals . \nthe set-on-a-train climax looks good ( even though the action is illogical ) , and the beautiful , crisp cinematography captures the rockies in all of their icy splendor . \nstill , that's not enough to turn a lump of coal into a diamond , and more than the movie's look will end up leaving you cold . \n", "plot : a

everyone else . . . lame ! ) , it utilizes way too many flashbacks to move the story forward , it's utterly predictable , standard , routine , see-through and uninteresting as a plot and it just sits

references to ricky ricardo and senor wences ( huh ! ? ) , the idio-plot points like when one of the characters goes on the roof to stretch his arms out and relax , but everyone believes that he's going to kill himself ( hardy-har-har ) and the cheap way of getting the audience to leave the theater laughing by bringing back a ball-sniffing dog that has no place being in the location at the end of the movie , well . . . i \ncould go on . \nbut i won't because i do still respect all of the actors in this film and actually did laugh at azaria , green and tucci's antics from time to time (

with this sci-fi eco-fable that's so bad it boggles the mind to imagine how the project ever got green-lit . \nthe script by carpenter and larry sulkis appears to have been lifted directly from last year's \" pitch black , \" involving a violent prisoner who must be released from bondage so that he can help a small band of humans protect themselves from blood-thirsty , marauding aliens . \nin the

-like story that the idiotic plot gets incomprehensibly confusing . \nbut you can easily predict each of the supporting characters who will be killed , along with the order of their elimination . \non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" ghosts of mars \" thuds to a laborious , bottom-of-the-barrel 1 . \nperhaps , indeed , there is a curse on mars films , if you recall two other duds : \" mission to mars \" and \" red planet . \" \n", "plot : based on the wildly popular \" jerry springer \" tv show , this movie follows the lives of two groups of people before they make their bizarre appearances on the infamous program . \none posse comes from the trailer parks and are to be featured in the \" i slept with my stepfather \" segment , and the other is based on some fly-girl whose girlfriends keep sleeping with her undevoted \" dog \" boyfriend . \ncritique : the truth is that if i didn't have a day job , i would probably watch the real \" jerry springer \" show every day . \ni find it quite entertaining , despite its complete lack of redeeming value . \nhaving said that , the show itself is outrageous , funny , and always filled with goofy surprises , as opposed to this film which features no laughs ( is this a comedy or a drama ? ) , uninteresting and completely unbelievable one-dimensional stereotypes , and a contrived plot which bores us stupid all the way . \ni never thought i would utter the word boring in the same sentence as jerry springer , but this film is an absolute yawn-fest , despite offering various scenes featuring simulated blowjobs , lesbians , t&a and tv violence ( who would've guessed that ? ) . \ni wish they would have either a ) made this movie much , much funnier , or b ) turned it into a complete drama and given us a real perspective as to why people like this actually put themselves through these public forums of embarrassment . \nunfortunately , it doesn't seem as though screenwriter jon bernstein spent more than a drunken weekend watching real \" jerry springer \" reruns to complete his script , leaving us with a boring film , featuring no laughs , one-dimensional characters , and no fun whatsoever . \nlittle known facts about this film and its stars : jerry springer used to be the mayor of cincinnati , ohio . \nfor this film , he won the 1999 razzie award for worst new star , tied with joe esterhas from an alan smithee film : burn hollywood burn . \n", "i never understood what the clich ? \" hell on earth \" truly meant until very recently . \ni've just never experienced anything in my life which was so terrifying , so horrible , so monstrously deplorable that it justified being termed as \" hell on earth \" . \nafter all , i've never been to war , i've never been the victim of any violent crime , i've never really been broken hearted , and i've never been audited ; so i really had no frame of reference as to people meant when they said that something was \" hell on earth \" \nthen i saw cruel intentions . \nin a perfect world , i would be in charge of all the movie studios . \nthe very first thing i'd do in this perfect world , would be to take every hollywood producer who thinks that setting any story in contemporary america with a 20-something cast playing teenagers and featuring a soundtrack ripped directly from mtv , and throw them in jail . \nbut it wouldn't just be your average jail , not even a maximum security installation . \ni'd have these producers ( and everyone else involved in the production of these films ) put in front of a war crimes tribunal and forced to beg for mercy for their crimes against humanity . \nnow you're probably thinking to yourself : \" is this really how bad cruel intentions is ? \" \nthe answer is no . \nit's actually much worse . \nwatching the cast of this motion picture atrocity try to act their way through roger kumble's awfully written script is probably a lot like stabbing yourself in the arm with a chainsaw and then pouring salt on the open wound . \nand then pouring acid on the salt . \ni don't know if kumble was trying to evoke comedy or tragedy out of his opening scene where marci greenbaum ( tara reid ) whines about having nude photos of her posted on the internet , but the only emotion i felt was sheer boredom . \nfrom that opening scene , where boring actor ryan phillippe tries to seduce tv actress swoosie kurtz , to the conclusion which i don't remember because i had practically fallen asleep ; cruel intentions is truly \" hell on earth , \" right up there with war and tax audits . \n", "about an hour or so into \" the jackal , \" a character wandered around as people were being shot at in a big suspense sequence , and one of the audience members in the theatre i saw it in shouted out \" i hope she gets killed now ! \" \nat that point it hit me : i didn't care for any of the characters being played by actors i didn't really like . \nwhen the sole reason you care about a character being played by sidney poitier in a suspense film is because he's being played by sidney poitier , you know something's rotten in the state of denmark . \nevery year , a couple films like this are released . \nyou know : the cheap , action packed international espionnage film , featuring a semi-promising premise , some big-name actors ( usually bruce willis ) , and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago . \nthis was the third one of '97 , following the very lackluster \" the saint , \" which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe ; and the surprisingly fun \" the peacemaker , \" featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain . \n \" the jackal \" tries to mix both elements . \nand you thought \" the saint \" was bad . \n \" the jackal \" is loosely ( very loosely , i hope ) based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that i've yet to see , \" the day of the jackal , \" which featured ( apparently ) a suave hitman called the jackal , played by edward fox , trying to assasinate charles degaule . \nwell , welcome to the 90s , where a sorta suave hitman , also called the jackal ( bruce willis ) , trying to kill the head of the fbi . . . or \nis he ? \nafter being hired by a russian mob lord as a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother ( killed in the opening scenes ) , the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere , from helsinki to virginia , setting up an elaborate scheme wherein he'll be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion . \nand like the saint , the jackal changes his look over and over and over again to elude people . \nthe agent working on the case , cater preston ( sidney poitier - yes , that sidney poitier ) , working with a russian agent , valentina koslova ( diane venora - lady capulet from \" romeo + juliet \" ) , gives up early on and meets with an ex-ira man , declan mulqueen ( richard gere , putting up some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of '97 ) who's in a massachusetts jail , but who has apparently seen the jackal , who has been eluding the law forever . \nsoon , he's out working with the two untrusting agents , and trying to help them catch him . \nthere are numerous problems with the film , and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put a finger on . \nthe film is supposed to be a big suspense thriller , but save a couple moments , the film never achieves suspense , or even a sense of intrigue . \nsure , the big assasination attempt is a bit cool looking and even slightly tense , but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register . \nthe film never picks up enough to become a thrilling experience , or even an entertaining one . \nit doesn't help that the plot is designed to be complex , but falls into so many problems , like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances . \nthe script of \" the jackal \" is a complete mess , mostly because it can't decide what it wants to focus on . \nis this a film about a man trying to find redemption by catching a nasty killer ? \nis it a film about a nasty , amoral hitman who's in everything for the money ? \nor is it a combination of both ? \n \" the jackal \" aims for the latter , but never focuses in on either character . \nthe connection between the two feels completely edited , so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan , you wonder how he recognized him so fast . \nthe worst part is the little past they try to give declan , most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend , isabella ( mathilda may ) , given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then . \nthe supporting characters are worse . \nsidney poitier is given a completely unplayable role , that of a man who is just stern sometimes , and other times more giving and likable . \nwhat is poitier doing here ? \nhe's one of the best living actors ! \ndoes he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this ? \ndiane venora's russian character is almost as bad , with a cigarette perpetually in her mouth , and a plastered on expressionless facade . \nit's not that anyone's bad here ; it's that they have nothing to do . \nthe plot is a joke , feeling like it was pasted together by someone in post-production who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time . \nthe jackal himself is not even much of an international villain . \nthere are several times where he's in a tight situation and makes things worse for himself , the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill . \ntake a scene where he's being followed by some agents into a parking garage : he quickly sprays his car another color , and adds a solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it . \ndoesn't killing someone attract more attention than it does distract ? \nand does he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in a public place ? \ngeez ! \nis there anything good here ? \nwell . . . a \ncouple things . \ni did like willis's icy expressions ; he may not have been real suave or anything , but some of his looks are worth a chuckle . \nrichard gere has a couple of good moments , making his character as likable as he possibly could have . \nand a couple sequences are kicky in that kind of proposterous , completely inane but fun kinda way , most notably : a sequence where he tests out a new gun on an annoying gun builder ( jack black ) ; and a bit where he seduces a gay washington man , which has its share of a couple good jokes , most particular a kiss by willis . \nbut none of these elevate the film any higher than it could go ; they're just little distractions along the way to amuse us mildly then toss us back into the world of dullness and stupidity that is \" the jackal . \" \ndirector michael caton-jones ( who directed the far superior \" rob roy \" ) has made a film that is made very couple months , one that is unentertaining , unintriguing , and pretty much cold , but will nevertheless make money because , hey , the trailers do make it look like it may be fun in that kind of retro-clancy kinda way . \nevery now and then , the filmmakers get it right ( \" clear and present danger , \" which was enormous fun in that smart kinda way ) , but \" the jackal \" is an example of when they go completely wrong . \n", " \" showgirls \" is the first big-budget , big-studio film to receive an nc-17 rating . \nand its release last year came at a time when senator bob dole and other politicans chastised the entertainment industry for promoting sex and violence . \nbut if \" showgirls \" is any indication of hollywood's future , the folks in washington should focus their attack on a more dangerous threat to american values--bad moviemaking . \n \" showgirls \" is a relentlessly exploitive look at the las vegas strip scene , and the film turns out to be just as trashy as its subject matter . \ndirector paul verhoeven and writer joe eszterhas , who collaborated on another shock-value project , 1992's \" basic instinct , \" follow the plight of a young woman ( teen tv star elizabeth berkley ) determined to make a name for herself as a topless dancer . \nit's a hackneyed premise to begin with , so not surprisingly , all of the stock characters are trucked out . \nthere's the demanding producer . \nthe loyal friend . \nthe bitchy competitor . \nlest i forget the scummy club owner . \nof course , any attempt at character development or a coherent storyline is just window dressing for the film's main attraction--an endless parade of full-frontal nudity . \nunfortunately , \" showgirls \" doesn't satisfy in this department . \nverhoeven's slam-bang , in-your-face style of direction proves neither arousing nor erotic . \nto make matters worse , you'll be forced to sit through the movie's clothed scenes , which don't cover up for laughable acting and some of the most absurd dialogue ever spoken in film history . \nverhoeven and ezsterhas deserve credit for trying to break ground , but if it's adult entertainment you want , stay home and watch the playboy channel . \nyou'll be the wiser for it . \n", "here's a concept -- jean-claude van damme gets killed within the first ten minutes of the movie . \nnow if that isn't enough to get you to finally see a van damme movie , i don't know what is . \nall sarcasm aside , it is certainly a different way to start a movie , of course a few minutes later we find out that the newly deceased had a twin brother -- so lucky us , we get to see more of jean-claude . \nvan damme #1 works for the russian mafia in the united states and is killed by some of their operatives . \nvan damme #2 is a police officer in france who finds out that he had a twin brother he never knew about after #1 gets killed in france . \nthe remaining twin ( the french cop ) goes to the united states to find out who killed his brother and avenge his death . \nonce there , he hooks up with his deceased brother's girlfriend , played by natasha henstridge , and the two of them set out to discover who the murderers are . \njean-claude's acting abilities don't seem to be up to the usual lackluster standards in this movie . \nin other words , just in case you missed the sarcasm , his acting is worse than normal . \non the upside , natasha henstridge is in this film , and she does what she did best in species -- she gets naked . \nsadly , this is probably the high point in the movie . \nshe is actually a decent actress , but didn't improve as much as i thought she would after species . \nthis is the typical van damme movie , with jean-claude doing a variety of high end martial arts moves on his opponents . \nnothing new here , and certainly nothing we haven't seen in every other van damme movie . \nsimply put , there is absolutely nothing new about this movie . \nit has a retread plot -- this isn't the first time jean-claude has played twins . \nhe still can't act . \nwe all saw natasha's breasts in species ( although this is one repeat performance i'm not complaining about ) . \nthis is pretty much like every movie that van damme has ever been involved in -- sub par . \n", "what makes reindeer games even more disappointing than just a predictable , lifeless action flick is the cast and crew who signed onto the project . \nmost of the people involved in reindeer games just came off terrible slumps with excellent comeback performances in their most recent films . \njohn frankenheimer , who made the unforgettable cold war drama the manchurian candidate way back in the early 60's , recently showed critics and fans alike that he still had some magic left in his directorial skills when he created the brilliant car chase scenes in ronin . \nscreenwriter ehren kruger gave a remarkable first impression when he wrote the script for the underrated arlington rd . \nben affleck displayed his comedic talents in dogma and boiler room , and even on saturday night live directly after the horrible forces of nature and 200 cigarettes . \neven charlize theron , who i was convinced couldn't act , did a decent job in cider house rules . \nwhen all of these bright stars come together , one would assume that the movie will have great potential to be entertaining . \nafter coming out of the theater showing reindeer games , disbelief was my first reaction ? then frustration . \nthe movie could have premiered on cinemax at two in the morning starring an all-rookie cast and still would have been equally lacking in entertaining . \nthe acting is so pitiful and the script so dull , i may have to rethink some of my opinions on how talented these actors actually are . \nit seemed like everyone was restricted to just the script and not given a fair amount of improvisational rights . \nwe have all seen ben affleck have some fun on the set , it is so apparent in a number of scenes in good will hunting when he exchanges jokes with his friends at a bar . \nthe actors in that movie were having fun and , from that , the audience had fun . \nreindeer games is the complete opposite ; the actors don't seem to want to be their characters ( even danny trejo , who will do practically anything , doesn't look like he is enjoying himself ) , causing the audience to quickly lose interest . \nevidence of public disapproval was noted when a woman behind me yelled \" boy this movie is horrible ! \" \nand when there were scattered giggles during the most dramatic moments . \nthe story follows a man , rudy ( ben affleck ) , who is leaving prison in a few days along with his best friend and cellmate nick ( james frain ) . \nnick has been exchanging love letters with a beautiful woman , ashley ( charlize theron ) , and cannot wait to leave prison and meet her in person . \nwhen nick is killed in a prison riot , rudy decides to pretend to be nick and take ashley out on a date for the christmas holidays . \nunfortunately ashley's brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) interferes with their relationship . \nthinking rudy is nick , he kidnaps rudy and threatens to kill him unless he helps rob a casino , which nick use to work at as a security guard . \nnow rudy must pretend to be nick so he can protect ashley from her brother gabriel . \nconfused ? \nthe movie only gets more complex as it goes on , until it gets way , way too complex at its climax . \nbut reindeer games makes its first serious mistake during the first half an hour . \nthe hero commits a greedy , selfish act when he decides to pretend he is his dead cellmate in order to date ashley . \nsome hero . \nthe point of a hero is to do the morally correct thing , a person for the audience to relate to or admire . \nwhen rudy lies and cheats his way into trouble , instead of gathering support from me for him to ultimately succeed in getting the bad guys , i felt more like he was getting what he deserved and even wanted to see him fail at times . \nthe most irritating part of the film ( besides the fact that this is a christmas movie released in february ) is the number of chances the bad guys get to kill rudy but fail or delay for some idiotic reason . \nthe routine in which the bad guy must explain his genius plan to the hero before attempting to kill him with some elaborate machine is getting so tired nowadays , especially when i eagerly want to see the hero dead . \nthe only saving grace keeping this movie from receiving zero stars is an amusing but pointless cameo from isaac hayes as a prisoner upset with his food . \nwhy he was in this movie for such a pointless role beats me . \nwhy any of these people had anything at all to do with this movie beats me . \n", " ( dreamworks skg ) running time : 2 hours starring robert duvall , tea leoni and elijah wood directed by mimi leder the first of the two asteroid movies coming out this year ( the second is the macho armageddon ) is actually a dull affair . \nelijah wood plays leo biederman , who during astronomy class discovers that a large asteroid is heading for earth . \ntea leoni plays a ( rather crap ) news reporter , jenny lerner , who soon discovers about this asteroid through a very long winded and boring way , and robert duvall plays the leader of a space crew , spurgeon tanner , who are planning to blow the asteroid out of the path of earth . \nalso featuring is morgan freeman as the president , and maximilian schell and vanessa redgrave as jenny's father and mother . \nwhile many people will walk into the film expecting a big special effects fest with the asteroid blowing everything up ( as the trailers seem to promise ) , the film is actually more of a character study , if a very poor one . \nthe main problem is that there are too many characters in the film , and not enough time to explore them all . \nonly the space crew are given any depth , jenny lerner , leo and the president are surprisingly 2d , and we never get to know these characters . \nand because i couldn't care for them , i didn't really give a crap if the asteroid killed them or not . \nthe script by bruce joel rubin and michael tolkin is horribly simple , and never really makes any interesting statements . \nmimi leder , the former er director and director of the average the peacemaker ( 1996 ) , again directs in a ho-hum style , and never really gets any emotion out of a scene , which is a shame . \nthe cast are seemingly on autopilot , although tea leoni does gives a rather good performance , even if she acts a bit too dorky for her own good . \nshe seems uncommonly stupid for a journalist . \nrobert duvall is on autopilot with a underwritten role , he just seems to be in this film for the money . \nelijah wood , one of the best child actors working today , is surprisingly average , although his choice of roles lately haven't exactly been brilliant ( i . e . \nflipper , 1996 ) . \nhis role is also vastly underwritten . \nmorgan freeman , again , is utterly wasted with a ridiculously underwritten role . \nlike duvall , he just seems to be in the film for the money . \nthe supporting cast are all o . k , none making much of an impression . \nok , so deep impact may have messed up character wise , but surely the special effects are good ? \nwell , yes and no . \nalthough the special effects should be impressive , with a massive tidal wave destroying new york , the special effects look like , well , special effects . \nsadly , the waves looks like it's been drawn on computer , and doesn't look too good at all . \nsurprising really , when the effects are done by industrial light & magic , who did the effects for the lost world and twister . \nin the end , deep impact is a wasted opportunity . \nwhat could of been a moving movie with good effects turns out to be a dud in both characters and effects . \nthe 2 hours the film had could have been used to much greater effect . \nonce again , dreamworks has churned out another average movie . \nlet's hope armageddon is a bit better . \noverall rating= review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities \n", "seen may 2 , 1998 at 3 : 40 p . m . at the crossgates cinema 18 , theater #13 , with chris wessell and sean o'shea for $5 . \n[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound , picture , and seats] \nthe big-budget , mega-hype \" event \" movie is becoming so trendy now it is becoming a weekly routine instead of a seasonal one . \ngluttony is hollywood's favorite sin , but it is the movie-goers who pay the price by being dealt the same things over and over on an ever-worsening basis . \n \" lost in space \" is the latest such offering - a film so poor it would be twice as good if it were mediocre . \nit's made up of every element of science fiction , but at no time does it evoke the slightest amount of wonderment the genre was meant for . \naudiences' attention spans are rapidly decreasing and as is the trend with such films , this one opens with a fast-paced space battle which serves not only as the most interesting scene in the film ( probably because it has \" star wars \" written all over it ) , but as the producers' way of showing off their budget through the special effects . \nbattle scenes are worthless without tension , and since we have no idea what the setting is it's impossible to care about anything that happens . \nin essence , the entire segment works like a teaser for an arcade game , not a piece of filmmaking . \nwe meet the robinson family - a family of five that does not get along but has been chosen to act on earth's behalf in effort to find another planet worthy of colonization due to the exhausting of our natural resources . \neach member of the family has a special trait and personality , and yet none of them seem like actual people . \nprofessor john robinson ( hurt ) is the intelligent , quiet leader who has devoted so much time to his work his family and marriage are suffering without his realizing it ( it's obvious what role this aspect will play ) . \nof course this is all established through extremely melodramatic scenes such as the children and parents arguing and bickering among themselves and with each other , while the necessary problems are \" resolved \" at the right moments . \nthe only thing worse than the screenplay is the fact it's presented in a completely serious manner without a trace of satire , and is so pathetic it's laughable . \nthe first act is not a building of a story , but a juxtaposition of scenes that serve no purpose other than to plug in all the required elements ( such as plot , conflict , and characterization - god forbid ! ) . \nwe're provided with the minimum amount possible of these elements to keep the film from being completely silent . \nin fact , it might as well be since the dialogue is virtually non-existent . \nyes , the characters do speak , but they do not talk . \nthey say things that only relate to the conflict , but they never really interact ( unless it's the cartoony flirting scenes between arrogant major don west ( leblanc ) and uptight , unemotional judy robinson ( graham ) ) . \nit's amazing that after an hour of trite dialogue and generic plot devices that so little happens . \neventually the pacing rapidly increases , but the amount of genuine interest does not . \nthe story finally gains some prospective by living up to its title as the robinsons find themselves lost in space after narrowly managing to defeat dr . smith ( oldman ) , the cartoony villain , and his plans for sabotage . \nwhat ensues is a series upon series of completely unrelated conflicts . \nthe first such scene takes place on an abandoned spaceship and what ensues could best be described as \" alien \" -lite . \nthe story changes again when the robinsons crash land on an alien planet and must act quickly to escape it and survive . \nbut there's never any real notion of suspense here because the script constantly wanders aimlessly . \nplotlines are developed , but each becomes totally irrelevant as the story changes from scenario to scenario . \nthe atmosphere attempts to be surreal by incorporating time travel and various time paradoxes , but it's presented in such a ridiculous way it's utterly boring . \nby the time the last act rolls around , there is no sense of a payoff building . \nthe ending does not go out on a high note with any kind of climax , instead , it seems to come to a sudden halt ( but at least it ends at all ) . \n \" lost in space \" is major film production at its worst . \nit's frightening that a film so poorly written , directed , and acted might be considered mainstream entertainment . \n", "the only thing worse than watching a bad movie is realizing that the film had a lot of potential and could've been effective . \nsuch is the case with _urban legend_ , the new horror film from first time director jamie blanks . \nthe idea behind the movie is that the mad slasher of the film muders people according to various urban legends . \nexamples include the killer in the backseat of the car and person getting calls from inside her house . \nthe killer wears one of those l . l . bean parkas with the hood drawn completely up , so you can't see the face . \ni guess halloween masks are out of style for psychos these days . \nanyhow , the premise is certainly a nifty one and the opening scene is spooky and atmospheric . \nit's a very good setup that promises more chills to come . \nunfortunately , the film never takes off from there . \nthe movie takes place on a peaceful new england college campus . \nlike most slasher flicks , this one also centers around a young female main character whose friends are slowly killed off by a knife wielding maniac ( or in this case an axe wielding maniac ) . \ni've always wondered why these killers don't save themselves a lot of time and trouble and just go after the person they ultimately aim to kill . \nafter the fine first scene , the movie degenerates into a monotonous series of those annoying you-thought-it-was-the-killer-but-was-just- someone-else scares . \nthese are always accompanied by loud bursts of music . \ni guess sudden , sharp music chords are what passes for terror these days . \nthe actual killer will attack at about every third music blast . \nthe slasher appears , attacks , the victim is eviscerated , and the tedious cycle appears anew . \nfalse scares should always be used in moderation . \nsomeone needs to tell director blanks that things like this just aren't as scary as they used to be . \nthis movie commits the biggest sin a horror film can commit--it's not frightening . \nremember the horror movie cliches that were so mercilessly mocked in _scream_ and _scream 2_ ? \nthis movie still adheres to them . \ntons of illogical moments about ; more than i really have the inclination to list . \nand i don't mean illogical in the summer popcorn movie sense . \nthat type of illogical can be fun . \nthis film insults your intelligence more times than i care to remember . \nthe last 20 minutes especially degenerates into such lunacy that you'll be laughing more than you'll be screaming . \nactually , you won't be screaming at all . \nat its best , the acting can barely be called \" adequate \" and the script could've definitely used a rewrite or two . \nthe film still manages to have some strong points . \nthe killings are certainly inventive and plentiful enough to satistfy most gore fans . \nthere are some intentionally funny moments . \n ( these were exceeded by the unintentional ones . ) \nthe film is well made from a technical standpoint . \nbesides the first part , there is also another good scene , a prolonged cat and mouse chase inside a radio station . \nif there had only been more sequences like this , that relied on tautness and suspense rather than loud bursts of music , _urban legend_ might've been worth your money . \n", "my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love . \ni love ralph fiennes . \ni love uma thurman . \ni love sean connery . \nhell , i'm even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw . \ni saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago , and i've been eagerly awaiting the film ever since . \na few months into the summer , however , i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times , and that it had ended up in the mid-august dumping ground . \nthen , in this final week before its official release , i learned that it was not to be screened for critics . \nand that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs . \nand that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique . \nmy expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things . \nthe film i saw today didn't even meet those expectations . \nthis is a lousy , incoherent mess . \ni would slam it harder , if it weren't for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine , lovable actors . \nbut sets are ultimately empty , and the performances are completely uninspired . \nthat's the main problem with the avengers : for all it's hip-hop flash and tidal waves , none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired . \nit's like a chore , a bland exercise in superhero film making . \nit also feels like its been cut to pieces , clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots . \nthis is just plain depressing . \nthe avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show . \nfrequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i've never watched an episode . \ni wasn't alive then . \ni don't even watch television now . \ni'm very sorry that i don't have this perspective , but , judging from the reviews i've already read , knowing the tv show just makes matters worse . \ni didn't know and love john steed and emma peel , and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles . \ni also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film . \nbased on what the film told me , i gather that steed ( fiennes ) is some kind of british super guy ( somewhat like james bond ) , and that dr . peel ( thurman ) is just a really smart doctor , who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits . \nthey are to work together , under mother's orders ( mother is played by jolly jim broadbent , while his co-conspirator , father , is played by the equally-talented fiona shaw ) . \nit seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather . \nhis name is de wynter ( connery ) . \nhe is a crazy scottish guy . \nour heroes had better stop him , or else . \n . \n . \nthe weather will keep getting colder until they \" have to go to hell to warm up \" ( one of the film's few funny lines ) . \nalong the way there is subplot after subplot , hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere , feel perfunctory , and ultimately make no sense . \nfor example , our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos . \nnow , killer bugs don't really go with the weather-controlling theme of the film . \nthe purpose of the bugs , other than to annihilate our heroes , is never established . \nthey're never even directly connected to de wynter ( they're controlled by his crazy henchman , played by eddie izzard ) . \nthe special effects aren't bad , but they're loud , obnoxious , and intrusive . \nlike so many scenes in the film , it seems present only to keep your attention from waning . \nand i guarantee you , it will wane . \ni stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didn't do any good to think . \nthe avengers has clearly been chopped up and re-assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn't tell us what happens . \nthere are several scenes in the preview that didn't make the final cut . \nin addition , many of the sequences have irritating , grainy film quality , which makes it feel low-budget ( the last scene is particularly bad ) . \nthe scenes that don't feature action should be electric , thanks to our wonderful cast . \nthey aren't . \nthe action scenes should be electric , because this is an action film . \nthey aren't , either . \nand what about this wasted cast ? \noh , it makes me weep with disappointment . \nwe're talking ralph fiennes here , one of the best actors working today , one of the best actors * ever * . \ni love the guy . \ni've loved all his films , until this one . \nhe seems like he wants to understand the film , but he's as lost as we are . \nand thurman , in all of her spectacular beauty and talent , can't manage to look at home here . \n ( i don't blame her completely , for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way , and it can't be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting . ) \nconnery , however , seems the most out of it , totally lacking any kind of focus , or interest , for that matter . \nwho is to blame ? \nis it the screenwriter , don macpherson ? \nperhaps , although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right . \nis it the actors ? \nfor god's sake , no -- these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling . \ni blame director jeremiah chechik , who shouldn't have been given the task to begin with . \nhis best film , benny & joon , is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be , but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor . \nadd to that a lack of experience in big-budget action , and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory . \nif the avengers has a saving grace , it's the set design . \nthe sets ( by stuart craig ) are big , colorful , and often pleasing to look at . \ni like the final set-piece , on de wynter's island , even if none of it makes a bit of sense . \ni admired the overhead view of the stairs , showing dr . peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere . \ni also enjoyed michael kamen's music score , particularly in the opening credits . \nbut this stuff is routine -- good sets and music are nice , but there's a lot more that needs to be here . \ninspiration , for instance , would have been really nice . \nmaybe a little bit of cohesion in the story . \nor a sense of purpose . \nmost of all , though , i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles . \ndamn this movie for not giving them the chance . \n", "if snake eyes were a dog , you'd put it to sleep . \nif it was a couch , you'd put it out on the sidewalk , where it would sit for a week . \nif it were your child , you'd be reading military school catalogs . \nif it were a ship -- no , it wouldn't be the titanic , that would imply glamor and tragedy -- it would be the exxon valdez . \n ( personal side note : i saw this movie on the road during a houston business trip . \nfor whatever reason , my hotel's cable system wasn't showing the astros-braves game , which featured a randy johnson-greg maddux matchup . \nthis forced me to pay full price for snake eyes instead of watching a perfectly good baseball game for free -- so the invective , deserved as it is , should be seen in that perspective . ) \nsnake eyes is supposed to be a mystery movie , and good mystery movies are supposed to leave you asking yourself questions on the way out of theater . \nsnake eyes is not a good mystery movie , but i had some questions : where's the manager , and how do i get a re-admit pass ? \nif i fall asleep on the drive home and wreck my rent-a-car , can i sue brian de palma ? \nis it too late for the academy to revoke nicolas cage's oscar ? \nwill someone please ( i'm begging you ) give gary sinise a role worthy of his talents ? \nand how , exactly does cage end up wearing the exact same shirt and tie as sinise does ? \nthe first and most glaringly wrong thing with snake eyes is the trailer . \nif you've seen the trailer without seeing the movie , consider yourself fortunate . \nthe trailer is a work of sheer genius . \nit manages to convey everything worthy of the movie -- the noteworthy steadicam work , the exuberance of cage's performance as a thoroughly corrupt atlantic city policeman , the essential elements of the marginal plot . \nthe expert craftsman who pieced together a fairly good trailer out of snippets of a wretched movie deserves praise and a percentage of the gross . \n ( is a best trailer category at the oscars that far-fetched , after all ? ) \nbut all it does is set us up for an overwhelmingly disappointing movie . \nthe trailer sets up what should have been a promising plot : detective ricky santoro ( cage ) must solve the mystery of who shot the secretary of defense at an atlantic city pay-per-view boxing match . \nunfortunately , there are multiple problems afoot . \nthe trailer gives away much , too much of the story . \nthe shooter is killed instantly , so the story revolves around why the secretary was killed and who is involved in the conspiracy . \nthe film's secret is ho-hum at best , and anyone who has watched the trailer and is aware of the law of economy of characters can figure out who the top conspirator is . \nwithout an interesting plot , without interesting dialogue , and without much of a reason to care about the characters or the story , snake eyes is a failure on almost every possible level . \nas much as i hated this movie , i must give brian de palma one tiny bit of credit . \nde palma is maddeningly inconsistent . \nhe can , on his day , create amazingly well-done movies ( the untouchables , carlito's way ) . \non off-days , he can be , well , just horrid ( the bonfire of the vanities , raising cain ) . \nsnake eyes falls into the horrid category , but there are a couple of moments that are worth seeing strictly for their film-school degree-of-difficulty value . \nthe steadicam opening scene does a good job of introducing the cage character and is a virtuoso technical job by both the director and the actor . \nthere is a split-screen chase scene that looks pretty good , and it's followed by a god's eye view of a bank of hotel rooms that's imaginitively done . \nthis is what's called giving the devil his due . \nbut the technical skill doesn't even come close to making up for the sheer evil of this movie . \nplacing plot holes to one side for a moment , snake eyes features easily the worst boxing match in cinema history ( george foreman is in better shape than the movie boxers ) , a hurricane that exists for no other reason than to punctuate significant plotlines with portentuous thunderclaps , and perhaps the worst , most overly drawn out ending in years . \nsnake eyes is a criminal act , an evil waste of time and talent . \ncage , sinise , and yes , even de palma deserve better . \nthe audience deserves better -- but no refund , no re-admit pass , no free popcorn coupon , can ever restore to us the time we've spent or wash the awful images from our mind . \nhowever , we are left with one consolation , that we were warned by the movie's title -- because snake eyes is nothing more than a roll of craps . \n", "the last line ( or near to that honor ) is the great butler , alfred ( the ubergod , michael gough ) saying , \" i think we need a bigger bat cave , \" or something to that note . \nthat's exactly what this film is - too big for its own good because it has too damn much . \ncut batgirl out . \ncut one of the villains . \nit's too much to handle in one dosage . \nit's so much that characters get left behind . \npoor elle gets a mere 3 scenes and a subplot which is introduced but never finished in any way , shape or form . \nand elle deserves better . \nthis is the fourth in the gigantic film series and the second from director joel schumacher . \nit's also the fourth worst in the series ( and second worst from joel ) . \nthe series has been declining since its stunning debut , followed by the almost-as-stunning sequel and then the anti-climactic third one ( first by joel ) . \nthis one's not anti-climactic - i knew it was gonna suck . \nit's up to joel to make it fun though . \n \" batman forever \" was fun . \nthis is a big bore of over-produced action sequences and shallow characters . \ni mean , this one bit . \ni'm gonna put all the plot in one paragraph : mr . freeze ( ah-nold ) , who's wife was dying of some disease , has become the new big villain these days . \nhe's a huge ex-scientist who fell into some weird liquid ( hello ? \njoker ? ) and now has a body temperature of a big fat zero and has a blue body . \nbatman ( george ) and robin ( chris ) fight him a bit but find they're growing apart . \nmeanwhile , another villain shows up , poison ivy ( uma ! ) , who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist ( john glover ) who kills her when she finds out he's used her research to develop an uberman , bane , who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had . \nshe emerges from her chemicals ( don't ask 'cause i can't tell ya ) as a sexy woman ( the real uma ) who's poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people . \nshe starts to tear away at the dynamic duo . \nmeanwhile , alfred's dying of the same disease mr . freeze's wife has ( but in an earlier state than she ) , and his niece , barbara ( alicia ) , comes all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the butler trade , but soon ( well , not really soon , it takes her 2 hours ) becomes batgirl . \nmeanwhile , in an unfinished subplot , bruce ( batman's alter-ego , if you forgot ) has been dating the lovely julie madison ( the even lovlier elle macpherson ) who wants a commitment after a year but he says nothing . \nend of her for all we know . \nmr . freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy and they want to freeze the world and then take it over growing new plants as their population ( don't ask ! ! ! ) . \nthe trio must team together \" as family \" to beat them . \nthere ya go . \nnot the whole story but no big context clues . \ntoo much , right ? \nright ! \nthe films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for a couple good sequels . \nhowever , while tim burton nicely balanced the villain/batman storyline ( although not wonderfully ) , joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one . \nhe gets some corny speeches , a couple clever lines and that's it . \nmaybe some stunts . \nfor all this , i can't even comment on george clooney as batman - i hardly saw the guy ! \nand when i did , he had horrible dialogue to say . \ni think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode . \ngeorge is in between them . \nhe's not quintessential , he's not horrible , he's good . \nbut i'm sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since they'll be critically murdered for this sorry effort , we'll get a good script and clooney will shine ( if he still has the job ) . \nthe villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher . \nlast time , we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the brains/comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey . \nthis time we have a somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain ( the same guy ) , mr . freeze . \nwe feel bad for his mental/physical collapse but does he really need to kill everyone for plants ? \narnold isn't very good - too hokey but kinda sympathetic at some points . \nwhen he watches old movies of his wife , he actually looks somber . \nwow . \nbut uma makes the most of her seductive character , getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness . \nit's like she's almost parodying herself in \" pulp fiction \" at points . \nshe's incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much a star better . \nas for the lower bat-people , chris is the same as he was in \" batman forever , \" although i think his work in these is too hokey when he's best at quieter parts in \" scent of a woman \" or just plain cool parts in \" fried green tomotoes . \" \nalicia - i love the girl but she's not particularly good in this film . \nshe can hypotheitically act , we all saw that in \" clueless , \" but her lines kinda sound weird . \nand it isn't the mushy-mouth this time . \nbut in all fairness , she has virtually no part . \njoel gets around to her occasionally and when she's on , she does stupid stuff . . . although \ni know i'm not the only one who loved the catfight between her and uma . . . \nand poor elle . \npoor , poor elle . \ni love that woman and she can also hypothetically act ( for those of us who saw \" sirens \" ) . \nbut she has no part ! ! ! \nit seems like joel had so much footage that he had to edit almost an hour out of the final product . \nthere are no \" couch \" scenes ( like my best friend noticed ) . \nnow listen to me on this one - in every \" batman \" flick , there's a couch scene . \nin the original , it was with vicki . \nin \" returns , \" it was a good make-out scene with selena . \nand in the last one , it was a chat with nicole . \nthis one , it's nothing . \nand batgirl does next-to-nothing in this film till the end when she's suddenly \" part of the family . \" \nfortunately , we get a lot of alfred . \nhe's the always reliable butler , in case you didn't know , who has been with bruce all his life . \nhe's a god . \nhe's a father figure . \nhe's also dying . \nthis got to me . \ni love alfred almost as much as bruce and to see him in a robe , not in his tux , and freaking dying just gets to me . \nwe also get the idea that he might have been unhappy the whole time . . . but \nthis is never answered , as this film is too cluttered . \nbut in defense , it does have some good parts , other than uma . \nfor one , george is a good batman but unfortunately gets nothing to do . \nand there are some nice touches . \nwhen they show the asylum at one point , they show the patient's belongings in a room and we see the riddler's costume . \ni laughed . \nand during a biker scene ( involving robin and batgirl - another subplot never handled past initiation period ) , we not only see coolio but a bunch of bad-asses dressed as \" droogs \" from \" a clockwork orange . \" \ni laughed at all these . \nthe film falls apart around the five-minute mark during an enormously long action sequence which must last around 20 minutes . . . or \ndid it just feel like that ? \nthe film should serve as another in the long-line of films which demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowadays . \npeople are fed up with stupid films . \nthat's why the word of mouth killed \" the lost world ! \" \nthat's why last year , indy films grossed more than ever . \nthat's why this will have a strong box-office initative from people who just want to see it , like me , but will die after a week or two when the word around the grapevine kills it . \nthat's why the next two big-budget aciton pics are john woo's \" face/off \" and barry sonnenfeld's \" men in black , \" both which are the first two to catch on to the wave early on . \ni like joel schumacher more as a person than an artiste . \ni like some of his films ( \" flatliners , \" \" a time to kill \" ) but a lot of them suck . \nhe's a really eccentric person and i loved one of his quotes about how he admits to being a mediocre director and that's what makes him great . \nbut his costuming for woody allen's \" sleeper \" was more interesting than this one ( and his costuming was cool - look for the nazi number ) . \ni love the \" batman \" series . \nthe first two rocked and i did like the last one . \nbut this one is not going to be one that i watch repeatedly like the other three . \nhopefully , this will also serve as a springboard to a better batman next time . \nand maybe they'll get smart and bring back catwoman . \nand michael keaton . \nbut we can only hope . \n", "writers : dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh ( based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer ) \nstarring : jamie lee curtis , william baldwin , donald sutherland , joanna pacula , sherman augustus , marshall bell , cliff curtis , julio oscar mechoso \ni suppose i'm not extremely surprised that \" virus \" comes to us from a deciple of james cameron ( john bruno ) , and if i strain real hard , i could even say that it's an obvious given , particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr . cameron's early works . \nin fact , \" virus \" is yet another in the long line of action/horror/paranoia thrillers from the \" aliens \" vein : a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally-threatening entity is out to get them , a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies , and maybe even to the first pictures , albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future . \nno such thing will happen to bruno , whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi-landmark feature ; while bruno may have studied under cameron's wing for years and years , i'm beginning to wonder at what capacity , and what exactly did he learn from him . \nin fact , \" virus \" should at least be mediocre ; the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron - a director who , if anything , just knows how to make a movie - and then make a film like \" virus \" is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z-grade schlockfest of a film , albeit a z-grade schlockfest with a respectable budget . \nthe film seems to not only borrow it's plot from last year's similarly-fated \" deep rising , \" but also from a clunkish b-movie from the '80s called \" leviathan , \" an underwater thriller starring peter weller , richard crenna , hector elizando , and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part \" alien , \" part john carpenter's twisted remake of \" the thing . \" \n \" virus , \" again , has a similar , uh , selling point : a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water . \nthey get on . \nthey break up into pairs and investigate . \nand they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy , has taken over all the machines on board , have meshed the machines with parts from corpses , and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary ( ha ha ) . \nnot that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving ; not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond-ian opening ( the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir ) , destroying any of the suspense in what could happen , but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters . \nof its motley crew , it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper , a masculine potential-romantic-interest , a drunken captain , a black technician , a tatooed aborigine , a manic russian survivor , and a couple other candidates for alien food , none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin , plain piece of writing paper . \nand it's not the traditional argument for films like these , where you may in fact want them all to be eaten ( even \" aliens \" played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers , but this was more of a plus-side for the film as a whole than the opposite ) ; instead , as another cliche goes , you just don't give a damn . \ni almost don't even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub-par to horrific , the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is ( and she is , just not really here ) and the latter being - and it pains me to say this as he's a particular favorite of mine - donald sutherland , who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performance-of-which-he-should-be-ashamed . \nlike anthony hopkins for \" legends of the fall \" ( the line \" scrooooooo 'em \" has been thus embroidered upon my membrance ) . \nor peter o'toole in \" caligula . \" \ngreat actor , horrific performance . \nit happens every now and then , and it only helps sutherland's career that no one , except for an elite few , even bothered to see this film . \nthough it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years , waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can ( read : early january , when everyone's still trying to catch up on the potential oscar-nominees ) , it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film : it's laden with complex machinery , boasts respectable production design , and it may even feature believable special effects . . . if , of course , i , or anyone else , could see them . \n \" virus \" mostly takes place on a large , abandoned cruiser , and mostly at night until the dawn , and mostly without the use of lights , not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey , but more so because , as the hollywood cliche seems to go , \" if it's dark enough , then the special effects will be more believable . \" \nand if you don't believe me , go back and rent \" godzilla , \" and tell me if there's even one shot where we see godzilla either a ) in his entirety in one wide shot , or b ) n the light so that we can at least see him ( well , you don't really have to sit through it again ; just take my word for it ) . \nbut all of this doesn't matter since \" virus \" is basically just one loud , cluttered mess of a movie . \nthe action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie i've ever seen ( my , um , favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship , during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves , rain , and any other ocean-extremeties the film can cook up , then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned - well , i must say , thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure couldn't figure it out when i saw it ) . \nimagine the first attack of the aliens in \" aliens , \" shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity , and that's basically the whole of \" virus \" : one horribly-directed action scene after the other , capping it off with a proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least a couple of the original cast members . \nand my god , it's a long damn sit . \nwith no interesting characters , no dramatic urgency , no tension , not one good moment of action , and no mesmerizing visuals , it's a wonder that it even got made . \nwe already know that big movie studios' mentality is shallow at best , and movies like \" out of sight \" and \" saving private ryan \" give you more faith in them , but movies like \" virus \" manage to drain a little more out of the pool . \ni almost wish that instead of making this movie , john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film a green light . \nthey read the script , they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who might have very well been a cameron hack ( and he is ) , and they still went ahead with the project , only to have bruno and company shit back in their face . \neven though i hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie , i'd say even more contempt should be aimed at mr . bruno for making a movie that could be this bad . \nin fact , shouts of \" egad , man , what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway ? \" \nare not only justifiable , but encouraged . \n", "deuce bigalow ( rob schneider ) cleans fish tanks . \nyeah , i didn't know that was a real job either . \none of his customers is antoine leconte ( oded fehr ) , a successful gigolo . \nwhen antoine has to

anyone over the age of eight actually find bowel movements that funny ? \nfor most of us , i think that childhood fascination with bodily functions disappears when we hit the far-side of puberty and discover how funny sex is . \ni , for one , will be glad when the toilet trend is finally flushed . \nbottom line : \" deuce \" doesn't offer anything new but it is intermittently funny . \n", "this is your definitive \" hollywood \" movie , extremely predictable , following the basic formula ( a horrible ending ) , overzealous writing ( meaning the writing was bad and seemed as if it were trying too hard to make it exciting , therefore making it look as if many things were merely tossed in there to fill space ) and if tommy lee jones and his lovable wise-ass character ( of which we've seen before in the fugitive and quite frankly , wasn't used enough here ) , i'm afraid the film would have been completely unbearable . \nin this film , ashley judd plays a women who is wrongfully convicted of killing her husband while out sailing for a weekend . \nwhile in jail she finds out that her husband really is alive and that he framed the murder on her . \nover money ( how original ) . \nwhile in jail she works out , exercises and basically does her best to get into near perfect condition . \nnow she has learned about a law titled \" double jeopardy \" stating that if she serves her full sentence and get out she could kill her husband and the law could not touch her ( although there has been talk that this is not the way the actual law works ) . \nnow her po ( parole officer ) , and a bunch of cops are chasing after her and are conflicted whether or not to believe her claims . \nskipping over to the acting : the fact that judd is more of a looker than an actress ( no offense , she has been good [simon birch] and even very good to great [kiss the girls] at times , in the past and i believe may have the potential to be better . . . \nbut she's terribly unconvincing in this and her performance seems stale and unsatisfying ) doesn't really add to the movie at all ; just takes away . \nas i'd said , jones was fine , although he did not have much to work with . \nhe was much more of a supporting character . \nwhich is fine , and he handled it well ; especially considering the material he had to work with . \ni feel this film had alot going for it . \noriginality not being an issue . \nthe acting was the only thing ( as i said ) keeping it alive . \nthe plot seemed pretty intriguing and could have been as well if applied better . \nthe action scenes were well made ( however sometimes out of place ) . \ni was just left unsatisfied in the long run . \nso basically some of the action may have been exciting but genuinely over-thought , the plot has certainly been done before ( generally speaking ) , the movie moves way too fast for us to get involved in either the characters or the plot , and is basically a film that was almost saved by tommy lee jones , who if he had some more screentime , could perhaps have earned the film a higher rating ; in my book , anyway . \nkeep this in mind , if you're in the mood for a good action film -- rent the fugitive . \nd+ \n", "dead-bang , an action thriller starring don johnson , lives up to its dumb title , or at least to half of it . \nalthough dead-bang is definitely dead , it is anything but a bang ; in fact , they should have called this one \" dead bore . \" \nin the film , johnson plays . . . \nyou guessed it . . . \na cop . \nthe role must have been really challenging for johnson since his character , jerry beck , is a gritty los angeles homicide detective , a real stretch from the slick vice detective johnson portrayed on \" miami vice . \" \na la mel gibson in lethal weapon , beck is an emotional wreck , complete with violent outbursts , unscrupulous police methods , and a bleak outlook on life . \nbeck's wife has just divorced him , and she is cutting him off from their children . \nshe will not even allow him to wish them \" merry christmas \" by telephone . \nbut beck's family and emotional problems take a back seat to the action and thrills in dead-bang . \nbeck is investigating the brutal murders of a shopkeeper and a cop . \nhis investigation starts in l . a . and finally culminates and climaxes in oklahoma , where he has a violent showdown with the killers at a white supremacist camp . \nvirtually every aspect of dead-bang is inept and ineffective . \nthe plot is incoherent and full of holes . \nthe movie depicts beck's investigation so clumsily that you never see the connections between his clues and his conclusions . \nthe action sequences in dead-bang are strictly third-rate , and the movie has absolutely no momentum or suspense . \ni certainly expected more from long-time director john frankenheimer who directed the classic political thriller , the manchurian candidate--as well as black sunday , seven days in may , and the french connection ii . \nin all fairness to frankenheimer , however , i should note that most of dead-bang's shortcomings seem to stem from its shabby script rather than from the direction . \ndead-bang tries to don a mask of social relevance by incorporating themes of racism and white supremacy , but its efforts are nothing more than token gestures and nothing less than insulting . \naccording to the movie's production notes , dead-bang is based on the real-life experiences of still-active detective jerry beck . \nyou would never guess this from watching dead-bang , however , since the film totally lacks credibility ; it is utterly unconvincing and unbelievable . \nmost of the characters in dead-bang are either atrociously acted , underdeveloped , superfluous , or all of the above . \nwilliam forsythe , for example , is painfully bad as arthur kressler , a wholesome by-the-book fbi agent who's offended by beck's foul language and unorthodox methods . \nforsythe's lame performance and corny dialogue makes his character unbearable . \ndead-bang marks the motion picture debut of tim reid ( \" wkrp in cincinnati \" and \" frank's place \" ) , but his talents are completely wasted in a cliched and contrived role ; he plays the chief officer of a squadron of black cops who help beck to nail the villains . \nthe sole function of penelope ann miller's character is to give dead-bang an excuse to include a gratuitous love scene between characters about whom you could not care less . \ni guess the film's title refers to this love scene since it's definitely a dead bang . \nthe only real virtue of dead-bang , believe it or not , is don johnson , who tries to overcome the limitations of the movie's pitiful script . \njohnson succeeds in giving his character a sarcastic sense of humor and a hint of depth , and his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally bring the film to life . \nand i must admit that dead-bang does have one or two amusing moments . \nthe funniest scene has johnson throwing-up all over a criminal as he interrogates him . \nbut when barf is the highlight of a movie , you know the movie's in trouble . \nthe other amusing scene involves a psychological examination of beck , in which he can't keep a straight face because the psychiatrist resembles woody allen . \nbut two funny scenes and a couple good wisecracks do not a movie make . \n", "it was once said that in order to truly enjoy some of today\u0012s movies or novels , you must \u0013suspend disbelief . \u0014 \nhowever , there is a distinct separation between opening your mind to ridiculous situations and believing a bunch of flat lies . \nit came as no surprise to me to learn that huntingburg , indiana ( where the film is set ) , does not have a mcdonald's , a sears store , a statue of a man on a horse , nor even a dam close by . \neven if you can ignore these somewhat \u0013white\u0014 lies ( even though the dam is crucial to hard rain\u0012s plot ) ; there is still a bunch of things that just don\u0012t gel . \nfirstly , morgan freeman , possibly the greatest actor alive ( after such films as driving miss daisy , the shawshank redemption and se7en ) , was cast as a shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for a healthy retirement . \nhe _should_ have played the town sheriff , an experienced and somewhat intriguing policeman . \nas a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms huntingburg , its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases . \ni say presumably simply because we never know what happened to them ; and it seems a tad strange that an entire town ( with the exception of some folk who get introduced along the way ) can vanish before the flood has actually started . \nbut nether the less , armored guard couriers tom ( christian slater ) and his uncle are carrying three million dollars in the back of their van . \nwith a heavy rainstorm causing depressing conditions and slippery roads , it doesn\u0012t take long for the van to end up stuck amongst mud and water off the side of the road . \njim ( morgan freeman ) and a small gang of thieves locate the van and attempt to steal the three million dollars . \nbut of course tom is more than willing to save the day , so he takes the money and hides it elsewhere in town . \nthe local sheriff ( randy quaid , whom most will remember as the drunken pilot in id4 ) and a couple of police men investigate the situation , but their morals are soon overpowered by greediness as each character contemplates what he/she would do with their share of the three million dollars . \ndirector mikael salomon has made sure that hard rain ends up turning everything topsy-turvy , and whilst the film may at first appear to be a definite \u0013goodies versus baddies , \u0014 there are numerous twists in it\u0012s plot that make this a slightly more enjoyable experience . \nbut by the time these interesting changes occur , it\u0012s far too late in the film for them to have much affect . \nhard rain\u0012s continuos corniness and lack of originality washes out whatever hope the script may have had ; and although it\u0012s cast is somewhat appealing most of its stars act well below par . \nnot at one stage capturing what could have been a fabulous on screen battle between slater and freeman , we are left to reminisce on films that dared to do something different and achieved more than what was expected . \nsuch titles as broken arrow ( slater and john travolta ) and face/off ( nicholas cage and john travolta ) come to mind as films that have mastered silver screen confrontations . \nstrangely enough , they were both directed by john woo and both star john travolta . \nwe can forgive morgan freeman for giving a slightly disappointing performance since he is newish to the action genre , but christian slater could have achieved so much more had the amount of crummy one liners been reduced and some personality added to his character . \nif you had asked me whether slater could perform well enough to substantially boost a movie prior to the release of broken arrow , my answer would have been a definite no . \ni now know that he has no excuse , and _can_ do better ( if you don\u0012t believe me rent a copy of broken arrow from your local video store ) . \nalthough hard rain never really works from the start , i somehow felt feelings of missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen . \nthe addition of an enticing sub-plot would have given the film time to breathe , rather than try to cram 96 minutes of action and disaster into a story that can\u0012t handle anything else . \ndespite the fact that hard rain fails on almost every account , if your standards are low enough you may find this to be a mildly enjoyable film . \nno creative flair and no inventive scenes means that hard rain does not stand up well against its many competitors , but it doesn\u0012t really matter since the last thing you would want to do after shelling about $8 . 50 is compare this to other films . \n", " \" some houses are born bad , \" goes the haunting's tag line , to which i must add , \" some movies , too . \" \nnothing short of hiring a new cast , a more literate screenwriter , and a new director could have saved this tragically misguided adaptation of jackson's meritorious novel . \nthe haunting is late entry summer dreck too slick to be creepy , and its seemingly endless stream of digital trickery and spooky ooky sound effects don't frighten so much as numb the audience into submission-the film is like a rube goldberg contraption rigged to shout \" boo . \" \nfragile nell ( taylor ) , bisexual theo ( zeta-jones ) , and smiley luke ( wilson ) are three insomniacs who gather at the reputedly possessed hill house for an extended study on sleep disorders , hosted by professor marrow ( neeson ) . \nmarrow's secretly gathering data on their respective paranoid responses to his recount of hill house's bleak history . \nhe's not prepared for the very real apparitions that terrorize the crew , nell especially , who has some ancestral connection to the manor's previous inhabitants . \ntaylor is thoroughly insufferable in her first big-budget lead . \nfor starters , her consistently dour expression sucks the life out of even the early scenes , when we're introduced to the mansion and all its fun-house trappings . \nher character is supposed to be depressed , having tended to an unloving mother for too many years , but taylor plays nell as supernaturally lame , alternately grouchy , mopey , wiggy and pathetic , and i kept wondering why the other characters didn't just ditch this bitch . \nas for the obscenely photogenic zeta-jones , she breezes through her scenes with a wink and a smile and takes the scenery with her . \nunfortunately , she's saddled with some of the most unlikely dialogue the screenplay has to offer . \ntheo's assessment of the house ? \n \" i love it ! \nsort of charles foster kane meets the munsters . \" \nwho on earth would say that in place of \" citizen kane meets the munsters \" ? \n ( furthermore , would you gladly spend a single night in a house befitting that description ? ) \nboth actresses fare better than neeson , who looks embarrassed to be a part of this ensemble ( and for good reason ) , and his character is the most bland . \nas luke puts it , dr . marrow pulls the old \" academic bait and switch \" on his subjects , but he breaks down and confesses to this the second he's accused . \nlater , he risks his life by climbing a crumbling stairwell to save nell ( it's amusing to hear neeson shout \" nell \" repeatedly , given his starring role in the 1994 jodie foster vehicle of the same name ) . \nwhy was this nice , helpful , and redemptive researcher so absent of ethics at the start ? \nthe haunting was well designed by eugenio zanetti . \nhis sets are obsessively detailed , and even before the cgi kicks in , they seem alive , never quite still . \ni do have one beef with this aspect of the production : the real life mansion used in exterior shots , nottinghamshire's harlaxton manor , is so vast that one has trouble believing that nell and company , no matter how much running away they do from ghosts and goblins , always finish up in locations that were established in act one , as if all the action has been confined to one wing of hill house . \neighty million dollars was spent on the haunting , and despite a powerhouse box office debut , i doubt it will recoup its costs ( including marketing ) domestically . \nthank jan de bont for that : proving for the third time that speed was a fluke , in that it was actually enjoyable , de bont has served up another ride , sans thrill . \nhis images , well-lit though they are , have an unmistakable been there-done that quality ; in fact , whole sequences , not to mention the cloaked , airy ghoul who owns the climax , feel lifted from a much smarter and infinitely more enjoyable spectacle from three summers back , peter jackson's the frighteners . \ni don't mean to suggest de bont is a plagiarist , i mean to suggest that he's a hack , having found no new ways to give us chills . \n", "play it to the bone is a punch-drunk mess of a movie . \ncontaining a good cast but awful acting ; an interesting premise but terrible execution , ron shelton ( white men can't jump ) gives us a rocky story with not one rocky but two . \nrocky no . 1 is vince boudreau ( woody harrelson , edtv ) , a bald , tattooed , newly converted christian , whose idea of christianity is not using the name of christ as a curse word . . . \nsomething that he has not yet successfully achieved . \nrocky no . 2 is caesar dominguez ( antonio banderas , the 13th warrior ) , best friend of vince who is currently dating vince's ex-girlfriend , grace . \nboth men are nearing the end of their \" almost \" careers when a fluke provides them with a redemptive opportunity . \nwhen both fighters of the undercard of a vegas based mike tyson title fight become incapacitated , the fight promoters need to find a quick replacement . \nour boys are tapped to fight each other , the winner of which is \" promised \" a shot at a future title fight . \nthe film is divided into two sections . \nat first , we have a buddy road picture as our two heroes , in grace's \" sassy grassy \" green muscle car , travel through the desert to vegas in order to make the fight scheduled for that day . \nalong the way we learn about their pasts and the opportunities that have come and gone by . \nonce in vegas , the movie settles down to the effectively staged fight sequences between vince and caesar . \nboth mr . harrelson and mr . banderas have provided us with stunning characterizations in the past , not that we'd know it from their work here . \nmr . harrelson is uncomfortably awkward , apparently never having gotten a firm handle on vince . \nthe christian conversion angle simply falls flat and unbelievable . \nmr . banderas is uncharacteristically non-charismatic as caesar . \nweak and ineffectual , there is little life in his screen performance . \nthe other actors involved merely play stereotypes of one sort or another . \ntom sizemore ( saving private ryan ) , robert wagner ( austin powers ii : the spy who shagged me ) , and richard masur ( fire down below ) are crooked promoters , lucy liu ( payback ) is a sex-starved hitchhiker looking for a good time , and lolita davidovich ( gods and monsters ) , is the shared girlfriend who can't make her mind up which boxer she prefers . \nbecause of the weak characters and the lack of screen chemistry between them , the film flounders with all the appeal of a dead fish until the boxing match actually begins . \nbut even then , because the outcome is so predictably obvious , the suspense factor is negated and we are relegated to just watching two men pummel each other . \nwriter/director ron shelton clearly spent much time orchestrating the fight sequence as it is well photographed , well-choreographed , well-edited , and well-performed . \nif only some of that same detailed attention had been diverted to the remaining parts of the film . \nas it is , the scenes which require the characters to actually talk to one another are weak and laughable . \nthe title is actually the most interesting aspect of the film . \nthe phrase , \" play it to the bone' is a reference to seeing something all the way through or not quitting until you've achieved your desired goal . \nthat is a biblical principle . \n \" know ye not that they which run in a race run all , but one receiveth the prize ? \nso run , that ye may obtain . \" \n1 corinthians 9 : 24 [kjv] \nachieving anything worthy in life requires \" playing it to the bone \" . \nwe need to develop fully persuaded mindsets and commitment levels in order to endure and persevere past the obstacles and distractions which lay between us and our stated objectives . \nthis is true in practical matters of our physical lives as well as the in the developing maturity of our spiritual lives . \nas a movie , play it to the bone is hardly worth our time . \nbut as a principle of life , the phrase \" play it to the bone \" are words to live by . \n", "i have no real tangible proof of this , but i swear that there are a lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly believe that if you take a bad script , written by a bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director , then it is actually possible to make a good movie . \nusing their logic , all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of super-famous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget . \nthis is the only way i can fathom how 20th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time ( not counting the time it took me to get to and from the theatre ) . \nnow , before i continue to ferociously attack what's wrong with this film , i just want to point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an exciting thriller . \ncatherine zeta-jones plays virginia baker , an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal ( sean connery ) . \nif you've ever seen any hollywood blockbuster before , i really don't have to spend too much time on frivolous plot details : the two team up for various jobs , stealing various things for various purposes . \nthe problem we come to is that we've all seen this a few billion times before and this film doesn't break any new ground in the big-budget/hollywood/action genre . \nthe result is that the entire production feels contrived . \ni'm going to be completely honest here : pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the run-time was looking at catherine zeta-jones . \nnow while this may be a compliment for ms . zeta-jones , it certainly isn't for either the writers or the director , who are not nearly as clever as they think they are . \njust about the most profound thought they can inject into this film is when they have macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between \" entrapment \" and \" blackmail \" . \nwith an eighty million dollar budget , you'd think that entrapment would at least feature edge-of-your seat action scenes or breathtaking special f/x . \nwell , you'd be wrong . \nthe action that is present in this film takes place in a huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular . \nunfortunately for all those involved with entrapment , die hard narrowly beat it to the screen by ? 11 years . \nthe reality is that after 15 minutes of watching this picture , you know exactly what's going to happen , despite rather pathetic attempts in the screenplay to throw in plot twists . \nmany scenes seem to exist merely as a reason to outfit zeta-jones in extremely tight-fitting clothing . \none particular scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid laser-beams while she tries to steal an ancient chinese mask . \nnothing wrong with that , but she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask was - so why didn't she and macdougal tunnel in directly under the mask instead of the other side of the room ? \ni'll tell you why : because it's a great excuse to photograph zeta-jones' posterior as it slides underneath those beams ( and it also allows a second scene of the exact same thing - the rehearsal ) . \nving rhames also makes an appearance in this movie , and though he has great screen presence ( although so do connery and zeta-jones ) and the most interesting character in the film , not even he can rescue this film from the depths of the boring film abyss ( a concept i invented just to describe this picture ) . \none last complaint : entrapment is littered of instances where macdougal will just slip into a shadow or behind a building , or he becomes obstructed by a moving vehicle and then in the next shot , he'll spontaneously disappear in ninja-like fashion . \ni can picture amiel patting himself on the back , thinking to himself \" it'll leave the audience wondering for days : how did he do that ? \" \nwe know jon , it's called editing . \n", "when i originally saw the trailer for \" analyze this \" a few months ago , i must admit , i thought it looked kind of lame . \nand then when the commercials started popping up a week or two ago , i thought it looked outright bad . \nbut then when \" analyze this \" finally opened a few days ago , an odd thing happened . \nit got great reviews . \ncritics were proclaiming it \" hilarious \" and a \" dead-on parody of mob movies \" . \nwell , with praise like that , i figured , it must be good and so i headed off to the theater . \nyou know that expression that says always trust your gut instincts ? \nwell , turns out that expression is more valid than i ever gave it credit for . \n \" analyze this \" is slow , unfunny , and badly acted . \ndon't get me wrong , i think that deniro is one of the top ten greatest actors of the century , but he is just out of his league here . \ni think the problem is he didn't quite know how to approach this material . \nhe plays his character , mob boss paull vitti , somewhere in between the realm of comedy and drama . \nif he had played the character straight , along the lines of leslie nielson in the \" naked gun \" series , he probably would have been a lot more successful . \nas it is , though , he plays the character completely serious at some moments , and for laughs at others . \nthis doesn't work . \nit creates an uneven character that never breaks out of the deniro mold ; you always know it's him . \nand the movie is badly paced , too . \nit never takes off . \nit just crawls from one scene to another without any forward momentum . \ni think the blame for this should be placed on the script . \nit's obvious the writer had a good idea for a movie , mob boss faces breakdown and needs the services of a psychiatrist , but once this is established , the movie doesn't really go anywhere . \nthe formula of the film seems to be this : billy crystal says no to deniro , deniro forces him , and much wackiness ensues . \nthis formula of sorts is repeated several times throughout the movie . \ni've said it before and i'll say it again : the only thing that matters to me in a comedy is whether or not it's funny . \nif \" analyze this \" had been funny , the pacing and bad acting wouldn't have bothered me . \ni would have been too busy laughing to notice . \nbut as it is , i only chuckled a few times . \nthe only really funny scene is a dead-on parody of \" the godfather \" . \nsadly , though , i don't think anyone in the audience i saw it with realized it was a parody , because i was the only one laughing . \nbut my sense of humour , i have come to realize , is vastly different from the general population . \ni loathed \" there's something about mary \" , yet loved \" baseketball \" . \nnow , if you want a movie that * i * think is funny , go out and see \" office space \" . \nit's full of genuine laughs and won't leave you glancing at your watch every 10 minutes , as \" analyze this \" did . \n", "jean-claude van damme movies tend to be , if nothing else , a lot of mindless fun . \nhis latest film , \" knock off , \" skips on the fun part leaving a wildly incoherent exercise that is , well , simply mindless . \nyou can't really blame van damme . \nno one , i suspect , has ever expected \" the muscles from brussels \" to contribute a heartfelt performance brimming with introspection and delicate shades of gray . \nand even his sidekick co-star , \" saturday night live \" alumnus rob \" makin' copies \" schneider , does what's expected of him , although neither appear to want the role of straight man . \nno , the problem with the film is its direction . \nthe first five minutes of the film are incomprehensible . . . \nand it goes downhill from there ! \nfive hundred characters , it seems , are introduced within the first fifteen minutes . \nvan damme doesn't land his first kick until after thirty--too late for most action fans--and by the time the hour mark has rolled around , your jaw will be on your cup holder and you'll be wondering why you elected to spend seven dollars on this mess . \ndirector hark tsui , whose previous film was the van damme/dennis rodman teamed \" double team , \" films at such a frenetic pace that it's hard to know what's going on , who's on whose side , and what the point of all this is . \nfaster than you can yell \" fruit stand ! \" \nwe're watching a crazed rickshaw race with schneider being bounced along by an energetic van damme . \nwhen schneider starts whacking van damme in the behind with a four-foot eel while enthusing \" move your beautiful big ass , \" the movie takes an unprecedented turn to the bizarre . \nevery now and again \" knock off \" will deliver some truly ingenious directorial flourishes--inventive camera shots and angles , wild rides down gun silencers and from the tops of buildings to the sprawling street below , revealing cut-ins within the frame--but they all happen too quickly , and within such a furious frame of reference , that they're wasted . \nif only hark could have slowed things down just for a minute . \nif you're interested in the plot , you're better off reading a capsule review than trying to extract any meaning from the on-screen shenanigans : \" jean-claude van damme plays a shady bluejeans manufacturer who uncovers a russian mafia plot to terrorize the world with \" nanobombs \" hidden in cabbage patch knock-offs . \nmaybe . \nwith paul sorvino . \" \na more accurate summary would be \" jean-claude van damme bums around hong kong failing to avoid large , blatant coca-cola product placements . \" \nthe fact that the film is staged during hong kong's last days under british rule gets some lip service but doesn't figure in at all . \nperhaps \" knock off \" 's most intriguing credit is that ron and russell mael composed the frenzied music score . \nsome of you might remember the mael brothers as the '80s synth pop duo sparks ; their contributions here are as confused as the accompanying action-- \" kimono my house \" indeed ! \nlike the cheap jeans and \" pumma \" sneakers manufactured in hong kong , van damme's latest is a real phony . \n", "in \" twilight , \" a ex-alcoholic , ex-cop , ex-husband , ex-private-eye , harry ross ( paul newman ) , works for a pair of aging hollywood actors , catherine ( susan sarandon ) and jack ames ( gene hackman ) . \njack is being blackmailed , and he asks harry to deliver the payoff . \ninstead of the blackmailers , harry finds a dying ex-cop ( m . \nemmet walsh ) . \nas more bodies begin to pile up , harry realizes that he will have to solve the disappearance of catherine's first husband twenty years earlier to find out who's willing to kill to keep that secret buried . \nnewman . sarandon . \nhackman . \nwith an a-list cast of oscar laureates like that , \" twilight \" would seem very promising . \nhowever , the script is tired and predictable . \nit would serve well as a tv-movie-of-the-week , possibly with some 1970's detective hero reprising his role . \nthe appeal of the project for its stars and its director , robert benton , is nostalgia . \n \" twilight \" wants very much to be a 1940's film noir with alan ladd or dick powell . \nall of the standard tropes are here : a hard-boiled p . i . \namong the rich and beautiful whose glamour hides sinister secrets , a femme fatale who tempts and confounds the hero , shadowy figures shooting from doorways , dead bodies confronting the hero at every turn , cops dogging his path and interfering with his investigation . \nthe script offers little originality , and co-authors benton and richard russo seem unaware that what was original in 1948 is a clich ? in 1998 . \nelmer bernstein's score is hauntingly melodic and could have been drawn note-for-note from a vintage noir . \nthe lead actors try hard-none of the three has every made less than a full effort , even when burdened with a bad script . \nthey try to invest every line and gesture with meaning , and they create a convincing sense of the relationships between the main characters . \nharry is fond of jack but is in love with catherine . \njack is dying of cancer and is jealous of harry's love for catherine . \ncatherine teases harry and enjoys his attention , but her real feelings are hidden beneath a carefully-maintained veneer . \n \" twilight \" wants to be character-driven like \" nobody's fool \" ( also directed by benton , also starring newman , based on a novel by russo ) was , but the tired script gives the actors too little to work with . \n \" twilight \" also squanders a fine supporting cast : stockard channing ( harry's friend on the police force ) , reese witherspoon ( jack & catherine's bratty kid ) , giancarlo esposito ( the humorous sidekick ) , john spencer ( harry's nemesis on the force ) , liev schreiber and margo martindale ( the blackmailers ) , and james garner ( a cop who bailed movie stars out of trouble ) . \n", "there was probably a good reason that the warner bros . studio chose not to allow critics to view this steven seagal film when it first opened . \nand , after seeing this piece of toxic waste , i now know why . \nthis movie is by far the worst offering that has hit the screen since possibly those ernest movies years ago . \nfire down below centers its story on a little mining town in god's country , somewhere in eastern kentucky . \nit's beauty and natural goodness is being slowly destroyed by an uncaring mining magnate ( kris kristopherson , who constantly looks like he wants to kill his agent for getting him this role ) . \nit turns out that he's filling the mines throughout kentucky with toxic waste for a tidy profit . \nseagal plays jack taggert , an aikido-versed , fighting machine , who is an agent with the epa . \nno . . . not the cia nor the fbi nor the nsa . \nit's the environmental protection agency . \ni had no idea that epa agents were trained to be killers ! \ntaggert is sent to find the perpetrators and to bring them to justice . \nwritten by someone named jeb , i could already envision the stereotypes of incestuous relationships , banjo-picking preachers , and dumb-as-nails rednecks . \nbut the script puts seagal right smack dab in the middle of all of these scenarios as he tries to discreetly fit in . \nseagal's idea of a disguise is a long-length $1000 leather jacket . \nbut to get closer to the kinfolk , he will fix people's porches for free . \nthat's another great epa asset - teaching agents how to fix porches . \nslow and plodding , this project is a total mess . \nthe sometimes allure of watching seagal is watching him outmaneuver enemies that outnumber and outgun him like in under seige . \nhere , his bravado basically turns into bullyness . \ntownsfolk who are foolish enough to challenge seagal are quickly subdued . \nfight scenes are quick and senseless and offers no enjoyment value whatsoever . \nand his soap box message wears thin within the first 15 minutes . \nthe most annoying moment comes when he barges into the middle of a sunday church ceremony , gets behind the pulpit , and beseeches the townsfolk to take control of their lives and to help clean up the environment . \nbut the epitome of how moralistically mushy this film gets happens when the person responsible for the toxic dumping , kristopherson , meets up with seagal . \nkristopherson asks seagal how much it will take for him to go away . \nseagal gallantly replies : \" i'll leave when you take the poison from the streams and the earth . \" \ni was expecting patriotic music to start blasting and a show of fireworks in the background . \nthis is truly nothing more than a pompous showcase for seagal's righteousness and narcissistic arrogance . \nseagal has been vanguard in trying to bring a new genre into the filmplace , that of the enviro-thriller ( on deadly ground ) . \nhowever , the message will never come across through poorly developed vehicles like this . \nstill , i believe in preserving mother earth , so save your $5 and please donate it instead to some worthy environmentally conscious charity . \n", "tom dicillo directs this superficial comedy about superficial people in superficial careers , all searching for deeper meaning . \nhowever , they won't find much meaning in the real blonde , and not enough real humor , either . \njoe ( matthew modine ) is a struggling actor , or he claims to be one , even though he has no credits under his belt . \nhis girlfriend , mary ( catherine keener ) has no pretensions about her career : she's a makeup artist , working for the eccentric fashion photographer blair ( marlo thomas ) and supermodel of the month , sahara ( bridgette wilson ) . \nsahara , who has acquired a new age spirituality from repeated viewing of the little mermaid , has an on-again , off-again relationship with joe's best friend , bob ( maxwell caulfield ) . \nhowever , bob has gotten his biggest break yet : a starring role on a soap opera opposite the beautiful kelly ( daryl hannah ) , who may be that illusive woman he's always pursued : a real blonde . \nthere are some moments of good humor in the real blonde , but not enough . \nthe best stuff is in throwaway details in the background , such as sahara's perfume ads : \" depression - it's not just a state of mind \" . \nbut to find humor in the superficiality of models and actors is to shoot fish in a barrel . \nand , unfortunately , the film's forays outside the realm of comedy are pathetic . \ntake for example the film's framing device of an old lady and her dog . \nthe story serves absolutely no purpose , makes little sense , and is completely tangential to the main plotlines of the movie . \nmatthew

matched against someone stronger than elizabeth berkley , who appears as another struggling actor . \nkeener's character has a stronger edge , but the insult self-defense class ( taught by denis leary

enough meaning to propel any drama . \n", "the ads for \" batman and robin \" scream \" the event of the summer is here \" and that's the problem . \nthe producers were apparently so intent on creating a spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it . \n \" batman and robin \" is 126 minutes of lavish sets , flashy costumes and big , confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substance . \nit's like one of those cheesy kings island stage shows ; bright , busy and visually diverting , but not very much fun . \nit wasn't always this way . \ntim burton's \" batman \" was an epic story of obsession and duality , of darkness and revenge . \nthe film , while far from perfect , was a striking mood piece with an otherworldly feel . \nbatman was a creepy , brooding creature of the night . \nthe joker , brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson , was at once charismatic and repellent . \nbatman and the joker were opposite sides of the same coin , battling inner demons and one another over gotham city's breathtaking gothic skyline . \nthose days of the dark knight are gone , replaced by a psychedelic ice capades run amuck . \n \" batman and robin \" has far more in common with the campy 60's batman tv show than with tim burton's tale of darkness . \nthe blame lies with director joel schumacher . \na former window-dresser , schumacher is adept at decorating sets and dressing people in exotic costumes . \nunfortunately , when it comes time to have those people walk and talk , he hasn't the faintest notion of what to do . \n \" batman and robin \" is overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that it's often difficult to tell who's whacking who . \nwhile the characters flail at each other , one-liners and bad puns are tossed about like confetti . \na few carefully placed jokes can set an action movie sailing , but too many wisecracks can undermine the momentum of a film . \n \" batman and robin \" doesn't merely lose momentum , it stalls out completely on several occasions . \nit's rare to see an action flick as sluggish as this one . \nironically , the parts of \" batman and robin \" that work are the ones showing the characters in street clothing , and most of those succeed because of george clooney as bruce wayne . \neasily the best batman yet , clooney's expressive eyes and weary smile gives the character a sense of depth that the script doesn't even hint at . \nthe film's most effective scene is a tender , quiet exchange between clooney and alfred ( michael gough ) , bruce wayne's butler and surrogate father . \nas for the other heroes , chris o'donnell's robin is enthusiastic , perky and horny as hell , while pudgy alicia silverstone is hard to accept as an athlete in her debut as batgirl . \nin a movie filled to the brim with major characters , the decision to add the entirely unnecessary batgirl and elle macpherson as bruce wayne's girlfriend is puzzling . \ni suspect the producers inserted the women in an attempt to convince audiences that two guys who run around in rubber suits with built-in nipples , shapely buttocks and huge codpieces are actually straight . \nof course , the real stars of a batman film are the villains and that's where \" batman and robin \" really suffers . \nas mr . freeze , arnold schwarzenegger gives his worst performance in years , spitting out a stream of lame catch phrases in wooden fashion . \nlaboring under a ton of appliances , schwarzenegger looks as if he's having trouble even moving in his suit , let alone trying to act . \numa thurman fares somewhat better as poison ivy . \nshe overacts terribly in the early establishing scenes of her character ( it's apparently a rule in the batman series that before a person becomes a villain , s/he must be a cartoonish , bumbling nerd ) . \nonce thurman transforms into the eco-psychotic poison ivy , she does a nice mae west impersonation as a classic vamp who can seduce men with her breath and kill them with a kiss . \nthurman fails to maintain the character's maniacal sense of style though , and ends up merely sputtering her way through the latter scenes of the film . \nthe biggest lesson to be learned from \" batman and robin \" is that more is not better . \njoel schumacher fills the screen with eye candy ; but the technicolor overkill merely emphasizes what a trifle the film really is . \nsome critics suggest that the batman series has run out of steam . \ni don't think so . \nmy prescription ? \nfire joel schumacher ( but offer him a ticket to a rubber fetishist's convention so he'll understand that there's no hard feelings ) . \ngive alicia silverstone her walking papers , while keeping clooney , o'donnell and michael gough . \ncall jack nicholson and michelle pfieffer and beg them to reprise their roles as the joker and catwoman . \nthen , ditch the campiness and , for the love of pete , lose the \" event \" mentality and make a movie instead of a spectacle next time . \n", " \" gordy \" is not a movie , it is a 90-minute-long \" sesame street \" skit , and a very bad one at that . \nthis movie is so stupid and dumb that it's depressing to think that some hollywood executives actually gave this the green light , and even more surprising is the fact that this is a disney movie . \ni'm sure children are the target audience of this movie , but only kids under the age of five may be able to tolerate it . \nit is the story of a farm a piglet named gordy ( voiced by garms ) , whose family has been taken away to \" up north , \" which we know means death . \nof course we can hear the animals talk to each other , and they actually went to the trouble of attempting to sync the voices with their mouths but it comes out terrible . \nactually , it's almost funny in a way . \nthe only remotely interesting and likable character soon appears , a little girl named jinnie sue macallister ( young ) who sees gordy on the back of a truck and essentially steals him . \njinnie is a country singer and the film goes off on a huge tangent to show her little concert and the people dancing to it . \nwhat is the point of this ? \nmaybe she is one of the producer's relatives and they wanted to show her on camera to promote her or something . \nwe then cut to a huge social gathering and drop in on another young kid named hank royce ( roescher ) who is sad because his divorced mother is dating . \nhe leaves the party and meets jinnie sue , but he accidentally falls in a pool ( probably because he was sitting on the diving board with a $200 suit on - nah , didn't see that one coming ! ) , \nstarts to drown , and is miraculously saved as gordy pushes an inflatable float over to him and saves him . \nif this had not been insanely stupid already the story quickly changes when jinnie gives gordy to hank who then ends up becoming the ceo of a food processing corporation when hank's grandfather , the original ceo , dies and leaves his fortune to hank . . . \nand gordy ! \nof course there must be a villain , but even this villain ( donadio as sipes ) isn't that evil . \nhe never raises his voice or becomes angry , and of course he has the typical idiot goons kidnap gordy but this is just so beyond stupid and cartoony we are constantly two steps ahead of the story . \nit's hard to tell whether the overall corniness and cheesiness to the movie is intentional because it is a family film , or if the filmmaker's are just this untalented and stupid . \nat times \" gordy \" is tolerable to watch , thus earning it one star and not the dreaded \" z- . \" \nbut it's just so unbelievably boring , cliche , dumb , unfunny , corny , and just plain bad it may scare children , it certainly disturbed me . \n ( 4/21/96 ) (

economics major at stratford university , hits some dire financial straits , he becomes a guinea pig for a experimental drug that heightens all five senses . \nafter some initial side effects and problems controlling his superhuman senses , darryl learns to enjoy the benefits of his abilities and uses them to land a position at a highly esteemed corporate firm . \nat this point , the film sounds more like senseful than senseless , but through some turns of the plot , darryl finds himself only able to use four of his five senses at once , essentially leaving him--yes--senseless . \nthis sets up some showcase moments for wayans's gift for physical comedy , especially when darryl loses his sense of feeling and his body goes completely , hilariously limp . \nbut these gags , and the gag behind the entire movie , quickly grows stale . \nonce darryl is shown without the use of all of the senses , instead of exploring any new comic territory , director penelope spheeris and screenwriters greg erb and craig mazin take the easy way out and simply recycle each form of senselessness . \nwayans approaches each go-round with gusto , but by this point he's simply treading water for the rest of the film's unfunny duration . \nsenseless would not be as problematic as it is if it didn't strive to be anything more than a comic trifle . \nhowever , the raucous and often raunchy comedy is wrapped in a blanket of bogus sincerity . \ndarryl goes through the experiment in order to help his cash-strapped family , and this \" serious \" angle seems to come from an entirely different movie . \nunlike wayans's last starring vehicle , the surprisingly effective ( and serious ) the 6th man , the \" emotional \" content of senseless is forced and unconvincing . \nany attempt at anything more substantial than broad comedy fizzles--darryl's romance with janice ( tamara taylor ) , a young woman who yearns for a man who is true to himself , does not generate sparks of any kind . \nonce his wb television sitcom the wayans bros . comes to an end , the genuinely funny marlon wayans has a promising big-screen future ahead of him . \nbut if he continues to associate himself with projects as flat as senseless , his film career could go the way of his once-promising older brother , damon , who is now set to make his comeback--on television . \n", "a slight romantic comedy with a feminist bent , but one with no edge to it . \nit turns out to be a conventional film filled with the usual clich ? s and stock characters of this genre . \nthough it's a well-written and well-acted fluff piece , it still does not have too much to say that is surprising . \nit's made for the gentle art-house set , those who don't want something too disturbing to think about . \nit's about a critically successful writer husband , alec ( pryce ) , who is so self-absorbed that he's threatened by his department store floor-walking model wife , kate ( bouquet ) , who wants to be a writer . \nshe meets his crass publisher , vanni corso ( walken ) , another self-absorbed man , and a predictable relationship occurs . \nthe fireworks occur because she outgrows her husband's first impressions of her as someone who was impressed with his genius and worships at his feet . \nshe now wants her own identity and her independence . \nthe film looked like the usual sitcom stuff , and is plagued with the cheap set design features reserved for a tv movie . \nthe film sagged in the middle of the story from the weight of its tedium , and eventually landed on its rear end with its unspectacular climax . \nit's set in london , and it opens as model kate rebuffs sexual advances by a wealthy american shopper , vanni . \nshe later meets him as her hubby's new upstart publisher who seeks to have her intellectual author husband in his stable in order to give him credibility as a publisher of quality , and he quickly wins favor with her by publishing her vanity novel . \nalec who is an obnoxious grouse , someone whom it seems it would be impossible to live with , tries to do everything to stop his wife from having her book published--which only pushes her into the grasping arms of vanni . \nthe publisher is proud that he's a mamma's boy who never married and is a self-made man who has earned millions . \nhe has recently acquired a failing old london publishing house and plans to revitalize it , as he proudly tells kate : \" if my father could sell pizzas in harlem , i could sell culture in europe . \" \nthe only thing that couldn't be sold , is this stiff story and tired plot line . \nthe mystery to me , is how the lovely kate could like either man unless she was an insensitive dummy . \nshe soon divorces the beleaguered alec and marries the soon-to-become-beleaguered vanni . \nwhen she writes a second novel , he rebuffs her the same way her first hubby did . \nit ends with the same results that happened to hubby number one , as its story of ambition and lust winds down in a whimper . \na business affair was loosely based on the real-life literary and romantic travails of married authors barbara skelton and cyril connolly , in their celebrated 1950s love triangle . \n", "if you're the kind of person who goes to see movies just because you long for some of that overpriced theatre popcorn ( butter optional ) , then this is the

insipidness unless you actually watch this film . \nbut at least we're warned very quickly that we may regret our ticket purchase , giving us an opportunity to sneak on out and into the adjacent show . \nwhat are the four ingredients of a really bad action movie ? \nfirst , the movie gives us an introductory premise . \nhuge caverns exist deep beneath the ocean floor , and in this area , many ships have disappeared . \noooh . . . scary ! \nsecondly , a cheesy soundtrack tries to connote a tone of mystery , but only succeeds in drowning our ears with an abrasive musical score . \nthird ,

out of his mouth is awash in comical flippancy . \nfinally , in the cargo hold , we see those that hired him . \nthey are also mercenaries that have tough-looking haircuts , talk with accents , and

ocean liner and devise a plan to raid the machine shop , take the parts that they need , and then continue on their merry way . \nlittle do they know that this cruise ship has become infested by some

. \ntheir realization of the situation that they're in doesn't happen until they are in the bowels of the boat . \nthose who are dumb enough to stray off on their own will ultimately get killed . \nthe corridors on the ship are narrow , misty , and provide the kind of atmosphere that all scare-fests must have . \nyet , despite the predictable nature of this film , there are some scary \" boo \" moments . \nbut most of it is just outright silly . \nand this film is unusually gory too . \nmonsters basically suck off the flesh and spit out skeletal remains . \nthere is one particularly neat scene where a monster has been cut apart and reveals a victim that is still alive . \nhe screams horribly as the monster's digestive juices continue to slowly eat him away . \nadditionally , it borrows heavily from speed2 , alien and a bunch of other recent films . \nthe mercenaries even run into a lone , surviving passenger ( femke jannsen ) who looks amazingly like sandra bullock . \nto be honest , when i left the theatre , i just had to laugh at how witless the film was . \nit's moronic fun at best . \nso , if you're hankering for a large bucket of popcorn served with a side of

kane and block out . \nbut when the aliens begin to menace society , it may take the scientists' combined efforts to stop them before they terminate the evolution of another lifeform : humanity . \nreview : \" evolution \" certainly has the ingredients for a decent comedy . \nit's directed by reitman , clearly trying to parlay his \" ghostbusters \" success into a twenty-first-century counterpart . \nit stars duchovny , and although one might question his judgment in lampooning his \" x-files \" character so soon after leaving the tv series , it should certainly provide him with plenty of ammunition . \nand then there's moore , who may not have much prior experience in comedy , but who has certainly proven her ability as an actress . \na shame , then , that it all deteriorates into such a hopelessly unfunny morass . \n \" evolution \" is a movie more concerned with its special effects ( which are quite good ) than anything resembling a consistently funny script . \nit has its moments ( a scene in which jones' body is invaded by an alien is particularly entertaining ) , but there are embarrassingly long stretches that are utterly devoid of humour . \nmoore is totally wasted , her clumsy shtick getting very old , very fast . \nduchovny has stunningly little in the way of material to work with . \nand the story is so formulaic , it could have been written by monkeys . \npart of what made \" ghostbusters \" so wonderful was a combination of a great script and characters the audience could root for . \n \" evolution \" is so mind-numbingly tedious that it's difficult not to start cheering for the aliens . \n", "deceiver is a plot twist in search of a movie . \nthis overly constructed film succeeds in having many surprises , and , being true to its title , being deceptive . \nbut there is little in the film that is worthy of deceit . \nbraxton ( chris penn ) and kennesaw ( michael rooker ) are two cops investigating the brutal murder of a prostitute ( renee zellweger ) . \ntheir lone suspect is wayland ( tim roth ) , a wealthy young man whose phone number was found in the hooker's pocket . \nhowever , a routine lie detector test turns against the

actually get lost . \ntake a look at l . a . confidential , or the film's more likely inspiration , the usual suspects for how a complex plot can properly be handled . \nthe dialogue in deceiver is as overcrafted as the plot . \nfor example , the film tells a few substories ( such as the tale of a woeful absinthe bender , or an alternative telling of how van gogh lost his ear ) , but they are so flat and so plastic that they come off as prefabricated and unbelievable . \nthere's never the sense that these are real characters engaging in conversation . \nthey appear to be nothing more than words on a screenplay . \nthe characters , themselves , are rather pathetic and despicable . \nnot one of them is an ounce sympathetic , and as a result , the labyrinthine plot is all for naught . \nwhat does it matter who is guilty of what and why ? \nwriter-directors josh and jonas pate seem to desire to emulate the coen brothers' masterwork blood simple , or the wachowski brothers' less worthy bound . \nbut , while they have got the plot twists down cold , they need to work on characterization and dialogue . \n", "this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disney's live- action george of the jungle . \ntarzan and the lost city , the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burrough's legendary hero to the big screen , is one of the most inept and ill-timed of any tarzan adventure so far . \nbadly conceived and poorly executed , tarzan and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves . \ni have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan ; it's not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie . \nfurthermore , it's even more curious that this film is rated pg , which , by definition , rules out any sex or explicit violence . \nand , while i'm not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story , tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production . \nof course , no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city , since the film's troubles originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the line . \nimagine george of the jungle stripped of all ( intentional ) humor , and you have a fair idea of what this tarzan is like . \nwith its uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences , the film barely registers a pulse . \nanyone in search of a relatively entertaining , family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book , which uses the same basic elements to much better effect . \nthe only worthwhile element of tarzan and the lost city is the pretty scenery ( which , unfortunately , includes the two lead actors ) . \nthe film doesn't attempt to re-tell the origin story ? the thinking is that it has been done often enough . \ninstead , tarzan and the lost city introduces us to lord graystoke a . k . a . john clayton a . k . a . tarzan the ape man ( casper van dien ) several days before his marriage to lady jane porter ( jane march ) . \nhe is living happily in england , enjoying the benefits of being a land-owning noble . \nmeanwhile , in central africa , the dastardly nigel ravens ( steven waddington ) , a self-proclaimed scholar and explorer , believes he has found the way to the lost city of opar , which he calls the cradle of civilization . \non the way there , he and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things , like burning native villages , to earn the wrath of the locals . \none shaman , determined to stop ravens from unearthing opal , sends a mystical message to tarzan for help . \nwith lady jane following close behind , he returns to the jungle where he was born . \nits patently obvious that casper van dien ( one of the pretty-boy heroes of starship troopers ) was not hired on the basis of his acting ability . \nwith his plastic facial expressions , monotone voice , and complete inability to make convincing animal noises , his range rivals that of steven seagal . \nhis pecs , however , are impressive , and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off . \njane march , on the other hand , has to keep her shirt on , which may be a first for her . \nsome six years ago , march give a solid performance in jean jacques annaud's steamy the lover . \nsince then , she made the career-killing decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color of night , which exploited her every acting defiency . \ntarzan continues this trend . \nmarch may be attractive , but , at least judging by this performance , she can't act . \nmeanwhile , steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy . \ninstead , he turns out to be little more than a nuisance . \nthe story line is pure formula , which has largely been true throughout the years for almost all of the tarzan movies . \nthe problem is that this one seems so childish and lifeless . \nthe romantic elements are all contrived ? in fact , lady jane's presence is necessary only so she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance . \nthe special effects are truly bottom-of-the-barrel ( including some laughably bad men in ape costumes ? apparently , animatronics were too expensive for this production ) . \nand , of course , as with all jungle movies , there are the obligatory cute animals . \nover the years , the legend of tarzan has been one of the most popular sources for film series material . \nthe most famous ape man was johnny weismuller , but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed the part ( including gordon scott , who is widely believed to be the best actor to tackle the role ) . \nweismuller made 12 tarzan features ; van dien will probably fall 11 short of that number . \nand , having seen tarzan and the lost city , i would argue that the movie-going public would have been well served if he had missed by 12 . \n", " \" desperate measures \" is a generic title for a film that's beyond generic . \nit's also a depressing waste of talent , with the solid team of michael keaton and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles , not to mention once-cool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of not-cool flicks -- this thriller is more \" before and after \" than \" reversal of fortune . \" \nthe movie is a big disappointment , and yet it's somewhat easy to see what motivated such big names to attach themselves to it -- the premise is both promising and intriguing . \ntoo bad the execution's all wrong , though , because the set-up of \" desperate measures \" boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use . \nsan francisco cop frank connor ( garcia ) is a single parent with a troubling dilemma -- his son matt ( joseph cross ) is stricken with cancer which only a bone marrow transplant can push into remission . \neven worse , the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe ( michael keaton ) , currently serving a life sentence for multiple murders and other various crimes against society . \nconnor tries his best to convince mccabe to go along with the surgery ; he's at first reluctant , but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital . \nwhen he does make a run for it , connor offers close pursuit , but for different reasons than his superiors ( including the crusty brian cox ) -- they want to take mccabe down , while connor needs to keep him alive , or all hope is lost for his little boy . \none misstep \" desperate measures \" makes is in its underdevelopment of matt's illness . \nwhat's needed are more details as to exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works ; there would seem to be other possible contenders somewhere in the country , and thus many of the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are just a little too hard to swallow . \ntake , for example , a scene where mccabe is trying to make a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of the hospital . \nthe police have their spotlight and guns aimed right on him , and what does connor do ? \nhe shoots the spotlight out so that mccabe can continue his flight . \nconnor knows very well what dangerous deeds this guy is capable of , and yet never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get to and try to harm his son . \nwhatever . \nto be fair , though , the lack of story background is the least of the movie's problems . \nfirst and foremost is how cheaply \" desperate measures \" trades the potential of it's opening scenes for the routine action ballistics of its final hour . \nonce mccabe escapes , the film becomes the fugitive in reverse and with no thrills . \nthere are countless scenes where the good guys catch up to keaton only to have him grab a hostage and get away . \nalso , the movie is so intent on giving you a hoot-inducing , lip-smacking villain ( the ads have compared peter mccabe to hannibal lechter , natch ) that it completely casts garcia's frank connor by the dullsville wayside ; \" desperate measures \" appears to like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist , and the movie's head-scratcher of a send-off confirms this . \nthere is some good to be found amongst this mess , particularly in the acting department . \ncast against type , michael keaton's understated menace is highly effective . \nalthough he's not given much believable to work with , andy garcia plays off a taut emotional chord . \njoseph cross , as garicia's ailing son , is surprisingly unsentimental , and marcia gay harden lends solid support as a doctor who becomes a major player in the unfolding chaos . \nthis cast does its best to camouflage the sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending , but most is lost . \nit goes without saying that \" desperate measures \" needs an operation of its very own . \n", "robin williams is a comedic genus . \nthat is , he is one

asked \" why are these people laughing ? \" \nalthough williams turns in one of his least inspired roles , he is easily the most lively of the actors . \neveryone else comes across as half-asleep . \nthe re-make is successful in that respect . \nit feels like a bad disney movie from the sixties . \ni remember the original as being charming , but my guess is that the memory from almost four decades ago has been artificially enhanced by the years . \nthere have been some updates . \nfred macmurray's flying model t has been replaced by a t-bird . \nhis faithful dog charlie is now \" weebo \" , the hovering robot . \nthe biggest change is that , with sophisticated computer animation , we now can have films show off special effects without being at all entertaining . \nflubber is anthropomorphized into a being supposedly with personality . \nthe gloop has little arms and legs and splits into tiny little gloopettes for a big dance number . \nthis has nothing to do with the story . \nthe only possible reason is to create merchandising opportunities so that kids can badger their parents into taking them to mcdonalds for the toys . \nnot that contributing little to the plot is a big problem . \nthere are very few aspects of the film that move the story and those that do don't make sense . \nthe discovery of flubber is going to save the college because brainard can sell his flying car to ford . \nanyone with half a brain would be able to see that his intelligent flying automaton is worth billions . \nit's unbelievable that his lover ( well , probably not a lover -- after all this is disney ) starts dating croft after the aborted wedding . \nthere's not one appealing component of this man . \nafter the professor discovers that smearing a golf ball with the

is made at deeper characterization . \nthere is a burly , female car mechanic , so of course , there is a forced lesbianism gag . \nmona's son , jeff ( marcus thomas ) is a simpleton , hence you can predict his dialogue before it even plods its way from his mouth . \nchief of police rash ( devito ) likes broadway musicals and loves his daughter . \nthere's nothing more to him . \nelle , the chief's daughter ( campbell ) , is bland personified , a dutiful girl with no higher aspiration than to have a child and be married . \nmona's husband phil ( fichtner ) jeckle and hydes from shirking coward to reptilian letch . \nbob ( affleck ) , elle's betrothed , and business partner to jeff , is a mumbling , obvious dullard . \nthere is no contrast to any of the characters . \nby having at least one character with some wit , or wits , to serve as counterpoint to the others , perhaps steinfeld's attempt at satirizing a small town infested with ambitionless people might have come off better . \nostensibly a murder mystery , drowning mona gives you almost all the clues immediately , then lets you sit back and feel superior as you watch the cast of paper people fumble their way to finding the killer , who could be anyone due to mona's loving manner with everyone on town . \neven that aspect of the film fails , throwing in a convenient , ridiculous and unsatisfying wrap to things . \nit's been a while since i walked away from a movie theater in an angry mood . \nwhat makes it all the more remarkable is that i rarely remember a comedy making me so angry for wasting my time at it's ineptitude . \n", "what are we going to do with jim carrey ? \nviewers of television's \" in living color \" know this one-man cartoon from such characters as fire marshall bill . \nviewers also know that \" in living color \" is a skit-show and that a little of jim carrey goes a long way . \nunfortunately , this fact was forgotten by the makers of the carrey comedy ace ventura : pet detective . \nthree writers , including carrey , worked on the slapstick story , which sends a self-styled \" pet detective \" on the trail of a stolen dolphin . \nthe missing mammal belongs to the miami dolphins , who need their mascot for the upcoming superbowl . \nfor plot porpoises , this story works as well as any three stooges short . \ncarrey gets to do his \" official \" schtick as he snoops around greater miami . \nhe leers and sneers , craning his neck to funny effect . \nhe even does his captain kirk impersonation . \nagain . \nall of this is pretty harmless stuff up until the point that you realize that the writers have absolutely no intention of focusing on anyone * other * than carrey . \n ( suggested alternate title--jim carrey : will do anything for a laugh . ) \nexport it to france and you may have a hit . \nas it stands , ace ventura isn't even good kid's stuff . \nthe profanity count , alone , is too high . \nwhich is ironic , since children are , probably , carrey's best audience . \nthe film doesn't even have the goofball charm of chris elliott's recent no-brainer cabin boy . \nsure , carrey has his moments . \nbut what can you say about a film whose high-points include watching carrey slink around to the theme from \" mission impossible ? \" \nace ventura has one glaring incongruity . \namid the butt-jokes and double-takes , the script takes great pains to set-up an elaborate and rather funny \" crying game \" gag . \nand , for * this * intended audience , that takes ( ahem ) cojones . \n", "there are some pretty impressive stars in lost in space - it's just that none of them happen to be actors . \nthe stars i'm referring to are the computer generated ones that make up the movie's \" outer space \" ; the stars that the less impressive actors hurtle thru as they try to find their way home . \nyes , in terms of acting , the star power is . \n . \n . \nwell , more like a falling star . \nkinda pretty , short-lived , and pretty much dead . \nlost in space , as if you really didn't know , is based on the 60's sci-fi television series of the same name . \nit's the year 2058 , and earth's precious resources are quickly being usurped by the needs of its massive population . \njohn robinson ( william hurt ) is the scientist leading a mission program to colonize a foreign planet . \nearth's entire existance is contingent upon a successful mission , but nobody , whether it be john's family or hired battle pilot don west ( matt leblanc ) , seems too enthusiastic about leaving their home planet for several years . \njohn's family consists of his wife maureen ( mimi rogers ) , his atypical teenage daughter penny ( lacey chabert ) , his ingenious son will ( jack johnson ) , and his beautiful scientist daughter judy ( heather graham ) . \ndespite everyone's reluctance , the jupiter 2 spacecraft abandons planet earth and makes its way into the vast eternity of space . \nunknown to anyone but the audience , there is an evil doctor stowaway determined to sabotage the entire mission . \ndr . smith ( gary oldman ) has been hired by a group of rebel conspirators to turn the expedition sour , and dr . smith has re-programmed a talking robot to \" destroy robinson family \" ! \nwhen everything that could go wrong does go wrong for both sides , the spaceship is warped to an unknown destination , and now the premise of being lost in space is complete . \nas for the audience , you will likely be lost in boredom by this point , wondering if the plot , like the jupiter 2 , will ever get off the ground . \nit's hard to tell who deserves the most blame - the incredibly bland and corny characters or the horrifically lame script ? \nchabert is basically the only one to overdo it , sounding like a whiny munchkin on helium . \nif you , like me , were convinced by commercials that her voice was altered for some sort of plot twist where her body would be taken over by aliens , you're wrong ! \nthat's just her normal voice ! \nin yet another example of a \" friend \" faltering on the big screen , leblanc is so incredibly dull and yet so obviously trying so hard to be so incredibly charming ( make sense ? ) , it makes you want to shove his ass out the escape pod corridor without an escape pod . \ngraham is a babe - thank goodness there was something for me to think about during this film . \nhurt , the black hole of excitement , sucks up any energy that might have been left . \nif hurt were available in tablet form , he would be a prescription strength sleeping pill . \njohnson isn't dull , he's just lame as the young know it all who winds up saving everybody's ass all the time . \nwant an example of how cool this kid can be ? \nhow about when he convinces the robot to think with its heart and reconsider killing the family ? \nhey , don't laugh - the thing actually listened to the mr . rogers-would-be-proud sentiment . \nbut alas , if you thought a character couldn't be much worse , there was rogers as the epitome of generic ( or , mother as she was known ) . \nwhy hire an actress ? \nthey could've had a white cardboard cutout with the word mom printed on it . \nnow that would've had some pizzazz ! \nlost in space luckily doesn't suffer in every single category that it could have . \nthe special effects are crisp , clear , and at least mildly captivating , unlike any of the presences onscreen save it be oldman , who plays his evil character with a great deal of fun and finesse . \nunfortunately , oldman is locked away for most of the film , giving us nothing but ample mocking opportunities to enjoy . \nwhile the special effects are pleasing to the eye , they are nothing you couldn't find in most modern sci-fi films . \ncontact , for example , far exceeds this film in terms of imagery and imagination . \nlost in space just has too many shortcomings to ever be considered a work of cinematic art , with numerous contradictions ( the time travel aspect was horribly flawed ! ) , wooden and corny acting , worse dialogue , and an ending so disappointing , you'd be happier to have seen the entire robinson family get blown to smithereens . \nthen again , with an ending like this film has , it's obvious a sequel is already being considered . \nwhat an awful note to end on , knowing there could be more of this in a year or two . \nthe attempt to be family oriented is commendable , but lost in space is lost with the illusion that special effects and the nostalgia of a classic tv series being revisited is enough to satisfy all age groups . \nwell , danger potential movie goers ! \ndanger ! \nthis movie crash lands without ever breaking thru the atmosphere of mediocrity . \n", "so , it's thirty years later , and oscar and felix are together again . \nthat might have been an exciting notion if it wasn't for the fact that the \" odd couple \" of jack lemmon and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies : 1993's \" grumpy old men , \" 1995's \" grumpier old men , \" and 1997's \" out to sea \" ( i . e . \n \" grumpiest old men \" ) . \nso , \" the odd couple ii \" ( i . e . \n \" the grumpiest old men of all , really \" ) seems just another entry in a tired series . \nthe plot is even similar to that of \" grumpy old men \" in that lemmon and matthau's mismatched characters are brought together by a romance between their children . \noscar's son ( jonathan silverman ) and felix's daughter ( lisa waltz ) are getting married , and former roommates felix ungar ( lemmon ) and oscar madison ( matthau ) meet at the airport and decide to share a car . \n . \n . \nthen hilarity ensues . \nwell , a few chuckles ensue anyway . \nneil simon , the award-winning playwright who created oscar and felix , provides the screenplay , which is a shock , because the script is a piece of talentless hackwork from beginning to end . \nunlike the original play/movie , \" odd couple ii \" doesn't find its humor in the personality conflict of its characters . \ninstead , it depends upon a series of humorous situations : oscar and felix lose the car over a cliff , are caught smuggling mexicans over the border , take up with two women on the run from their violent husbands ( the women are played by christine baranski of \" cybill \" and jean smart of \" designing women \" ) , and hitch a ride with a man who dies in the desert . \nthe original 1968 movie \" the odd couple \" remains a classic comedy . \nit introduced the motif of roommate-as-spouse that has provided gags for movies and sitcoms ever since . \nit was the second outing for the lemmon/matthau team ( which debuted in 1966's \" the fortune cookie \" ) , and they made a couple more worthwhile comedies , \" the front page \" ( 1974 ) and \" buddy buddy \" ( 1981 ) , before going their separate ways . \nthe reunion of lemmon and matthau in \" grumpy old men \" six years ago was delightful , and its sequel seemed appropriate because it tied up some loose ends from the first movie . \nbut \" out to sea \" and \" the odd couple ii \" are just beating a grumpy old horse . \n ( you can add lemmon's \" my fellow americans , \" i . e . \n \" grumpy old presidents , \" to that list , too . ) \nlet's hope that hollywood offers these two actors something fresh to do . \nlet's hope also that we see neil simon's name on movies that do it justice ( this is his first since 1993's \" lost in yonkers \" ) . \n", "except for a few bright moments of good verbal comedy , that old feeling is embarrassing to sit through . \nbette midler and dennis farina play lilly and dan , actress and author , once married , now violently divorced , and back together one last time for their daughter molly's ( paula marshall ) wedding . \nlilly and dan hate each other passionately -- so passionately that they have sex at the wedding and fall in love again . \neach ditches his or her current spouse of 14 years and runs off with the other . \nmolly , married now only 24 hours , runs off in search of her irresponsible parents while her husband keith ( jamie denton ) tries to console the abandoned spouses . \nin molly's search for her parents , she somehow falls in love with lilly's paparazzo joey ( danny nucci ) . \nmeanwhile , the newlywed keith ends up consoling dan's wife rowena ( gail o'grady ) in bed . \nthe audience i saw this with apparently thought that all the adultery was hilarious . \ni'm no dan quayle , but i thought it was a bit creepy . \nthe message seemed to be \" ignore your responsibilities unrepentantly and have fun fucking who you wish . \" \n \" family values \" aside , there's something cruel about all this . \nperhaps this movie would have played well as a black comedy , but the movie is a romantic comedy . \nwe are supposed to be rooting for these creeps . \nreiner and screenwriter leslie dixon tried to make it easier on us by making the victims unlikeable . \nlilly's husband is a new-age flake who rambles about \" emotional valet parking , \" so we can write him off as irrelevant . \ndan's wife is vain , manipulative , and jealous so we can write her off as a bitch . \nmolly's husband is a career-conscious , self-centered republican politician who thinks she's too fat ( and just for good measure , he also fucked dan's wife ) , so we can write him off as a prick . \neveryone else falls in love . \nbut still , that somehow doesn't justify the actions of the movie's main characters . \n \" he's a prick \" or \" she's a bitch \" is no defense . \nthe movie is somewhat redeemed by some funny dialog -- often during heated arguments -- and by above-average performances by midler and farina ( breaking out of his character-actor mold ) . \nother than that , it's a standard romantic comedy with a very substandard gimmick . \n", "maybe this mission should have been scrubbed \nmission to mars \na film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman \nthere's a world of difference between artists and technicians . \nthe artist has a vision to create something new . \nhe may not do it well , it might be sloppy , but it's something you've never seen before . \na good technician can make it look good , but without direction from his own inner artist or someone else , it's going to be just a xerox . \nobviously successful films need both skills . \nbrian de palma is a masterful technician . \nhe's spent his career copying others , most notably hitchcock . \nhe usually knows exactly what to do to make a scene work , but only because he has learned it by rote . \naside from rare flashes of originality , his films are often soul-dead . \nin de palma's latest , he turns his attention to stanley kubrick . \nto tell the truth , i enjoyed portions of this movie , but i liked it a lot better over 30 years ago when it was called \" 2001 \" . \ni enjoyed it even more when it was titled \" close encounters \" . \nnasa has set its sights for mars . \nwhen the first crew meets with disaster , a rescue mission is sent to the red planet . \nthey don't do so well either , but eventually meet up the lone surviving astronaut-gone-rasta and solve the mysteries of the universe . \nand it's all so boring . \nthere are so many scenes that just don't work , it's difficult to begin . \nwhen the first crew is a few feet away from a raging massive upside-down martian tornado ( which looks remarkably like a sandworm from \" dune \" ) destroying everything in its path , they just hang out watching . \nerror . \nthe most interesting character ( and that's not saying much ) is killed off . \nerror . \nthe alien is laughable . \nerror . \nthe rest of the characters are the dullest people imaginable . \nerror . \nthere's some nice eyecandy . \nthe face on mars , which turns out to be a giant metal thai buddha head , looks cool . \na three-dimensional holographic planetarium is more fun to watch than anything at disney world . \nmaneuvering in space suits outside the ship seems realistic . \nbut there's so much more that feels as if we've been there before . \nfrom \" 2001 \" , there's the rotating space station , the blinding white room . \n>from \" close encounters \" , they solve a sound puzzle and play it to the aliens . \nthe list goes on . \nthe actors are mostly mobile wooden statues . \neven gary sinise and tim robbins can't muster enough emotion to convince us they are breathing . \nno one seems to care about anything that happens . \nyou won't either . \nthe absolutely worst sin is the blatant product placement as dr . pepper , with a 20 foot tall logo , saves the day . \nthey should save the commercials for those insipid bits before the film . \n", "mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival . \nas you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival . \nit may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time . \nin fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry . \ntoward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart . \nthe film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it . \nsomething else is what he did . \nthe film opens with a woman ( played by laura harring ) about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life . \nshe crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep . \nmeanwhile young vivacious betty ( naomi watts ) arrives in hollywood from canada . \nshe wants to build a career as an actress . \nbetty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow . \nshe does not know who the woman is . \nshe is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is . \nthey fix on a name rita for her , but are not sure if this right or not . \nmeanwhile local director adam kesher ( justin theroux ) has problems of his own . \nhe is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else , cammie rhodes ( melissa george ) . \nthese two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong . \nthere is also a strange character called the cowboy ( monty montgomery ) adding to the confusion . \nin what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits . \na lot of mulholland drive starts out fun . \nlynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film . \nhe just chooses not to . \nas with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason . \nthere are no earthworms , but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches . \nthe film is a little long for the subject matter . \ntoward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes , clearly not intended for the tv pilot . \nunfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers . \ni will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \nmulholland drive spoiler warning . \ni have rated this film fairly low . \nyou should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film . \ndavid lynch is in large part a dark satirist . \nmost of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside . \nin mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre . \nwhat he does with this film is ( are you sure you want to read this ? ) \nplaying off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on . \nthe first 80% of the film he tells a simple multi-thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout . \nthen suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something . \nthe audience expectation is that they will add up . \nbut he has given clues that are self-contradictory . \nlynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories . \nin fact , the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation , i think lynch is merely playing a joke . \nthere is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties . \nmad magazine called it a poiuyt . \nother sources called it a tri- pronged u-bar . \nlook at small portions of it and makes sense . \nlook at the whole figure and it does not . \nthis film is , in my estimation , the cinematic equivalent of a tri-pronged u-bar . \n", "ingredients : possessed plastic dolls in love , plastic dolls having sex \nstarring : jennifer tilly , voice of brad dourif , katherine heigl , nick stabile , john ritter \nsynopsis : this is the fourth film in the chucky series , which debuted in the late 1980s . \nbasically , chucky is a plastic doll that can walk and talk because it is possessed by the spirit of a slain murderer . \nin bride of chucky , chucky's longtime girlfriend tiffany ( jennifer tilly ) dies and her spirit inhabits a female plastic doll through voodoo . \ndolls tiffany and chucky get married and embark on a quest to reach a cemetery in new jersey , where a mystical gem might enable them to be humans . \nthe dolls stow away in the back of a vehicle driven by a newly eloped couple , so in the side plot , the couple suspects each other of being a murderer . \nopinion : bride of chucky is an attempt at horror with humor , but doesn't succeed . \nsomehow , chucky moaning about mid life crisis , and how he should have gotten married does not make for a very scary chucky . \nand tiffany harping about mid life crisis , and how she should have gotten married does not make for a very scary tiffany . \nthe suspenseless bride of chucky relies mostly on jennifer tilly's cleavage to keep attention during the first half , and on occasional puns to keep attention during the second half . \nthe best that can be said about bride of chucky is that it is sarcastic . \n", "watching the movie , i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup , cute 'n cuddly , computer-generated monkey . \nif the monkey died , the movie got an extra half star . \nalas , the monkey showed up at the end , unharmed , to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs . \nwhat that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars . \nthat's pretty generous , considering the movie's camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek . \nwhen will robinson ( jack johnson ) teaches his pet robot about friendship , you are actually supposed to buy it . \nso why such a seemingly high rating ? \nthere are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage . \nfirst , we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater . \nthe sound and screen kicked ass . \nnobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did ( and i don't necessarily mean that in a good way ) . \nalso , there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie's tension . \ni even liked the computer-generated settings . \ni usually prefer to see models or sets , but the cg was more detailed than i've seen in a lot of movies ; it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities . \nalso , gary oldman is never a bad actor , even though he is typecast as a villain . \nwilliam hurt isn't too bad either . \nneither actor had a great role , but their performances were watchable . \nand perhaps i shouldn't admit this , but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood . \nthere is very little swearing or blood ; there is a strong moral message , saccharine though it is ; there is a bit of romance ( whose culmination after 2 hours is a \" real \" kiss -- no sex ) . \nit felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six . \nthose movies were probably as bad as lost in space , but at the time , they were manna from heaven . \nthat type of moviemaking is a lost art . \nnow for the bad news . \nworst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue . \nit's squeaky-clean , family fun , trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction . \n \" you better hold on to your joystick , \" is one such line . \nand when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs , they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign . \nsecond worst , and closely related , is the screenplay . \nthe story's exposition takes place at a press conference , which allows the writers to explain what's happening with the least amount of creativity , effort , or interest . \nonce the story gets going , i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while , but on the whole , the situations that arise are silly and contrived . \nwhen gary oldman easily reprograms will's pet robot to kill the robinsons , my friend summed it up perfectly : \" he flipped the switch to 'evil . ' \" \nthen there's the tone of the movie . \nthe colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson . \nthen it could be an adventure movie . \nthey're mostly right , except that johnson ( will ) wasn't a good enough actor to carry it off . \nstill , that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination . \njust because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn't mean that we have to bow to a \" promise keepers \" notion of who's the center of a family . \nmany quality family films have been made with a non-traditional family structure ( fly away home comes to mind ) to much better effect . \nand the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie . \nin star wars , the rebels were the good guys . \nwe were rooting for those who were fighting against the system . \nin lost in space , the rebels are the bad guys , a terrorist force that must be killed , crushed and silenced so that our children may live free . \nthat ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists . \nfinally , a few specific details deserve criticism . \nthe movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056 . \nwhy ? \nwhy bother saying what year this is . \njust tell us it's the future . \ni bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997 . \nsetting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it won't be timeless ( not that this movie was really in the running anyway . ) . \nthen there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole . \nthis silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny's barber chair , and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers haven't learned a thing about ergonomics . \none vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed : it made lost in space look cool . \nthe strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and , out of context , made it sound hip . \nthis is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie . \nbut if that's the best part of the movie , i can't in good conscience recommend it . \nstill , if you get stuck seeing it , as we did , you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance , think of liking bad movies as a child , and bring along your \" bad movie bingo \" cards . \n", "i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night , but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies . \nluckily , my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta ! \ni knew it was going to be a bad print with only half-faces and poor sound quality , but i couldn't help myself . . . \ni got it . \nwell , after watching it ( it indeed was a bad print ) i was glad i didn't dish out $7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie . \nthis movie really sucks . \nit had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy ! ! \nfor example , how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days ? \njackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail . \nthe songs are bad , the acting is bad ( especially deepti bhatnagar's ) , and the direction is the worst of all . \nthe comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up . \ni didn't even finish the movie . . . \ni couldn't take it anymore . \nnote : but if anyone out there liked aatish ( by the same director ) , i guess you'd like this movie . \nit's practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff . \naditya panscholi is the sidekick again . \n ( i was going to give it a zero , but i personally like jackie shroff , so i loosened up a little . \nhe looked fresh , wore good clothes ( as always ) , and his performance , even though it wasn't his best , was the only saving grace of the movie ) \n", "starship troopers is a bad movie . \ni mean , a really , really , bad movie . \nnot only does it cross the line of bad taste when it comes to blood , gore and body parts shown on the screen , it blissfully jumps over that line , apparently unaware that the movie trailers appeal to an audience of five to fifteen year olds ( of which i saw many in the theatre ) . \nlooking past the appalling sight of overdone violence , we are left with a movie with a thin plot at best , no strong lead characters , a blatant disregard for physics , and a very obvious naziesque theme . \nthat being said , onto the review : the movie starts with a propaganda message from the federation ( who's logo bears a * strong * resemblance to a nazi german eagle ) , urging the populace to go off and fight the bugs , who are attempting to destroy earth . \nthe film shows large rallies with young children in attendance , pledging allegiance to the federation ( again , sound familiar ? ) . \nas the movie progresses , we are shown terror tactic training , as a drill sargeant very graphically compound fractures one recruits arm , and throws a knife through another's hand . \neventually , the recruits embark on a journey to a location two thirds of the way across the milky way galaxy , to fight the bugs on their home planet . \nas our faster than light travelling \" heroes \" arrive on planet , they drop onto the planet , and burst our of their craft brandishing . . . \n \" what ? \" \nyou say , \" laser beam weapons ? \nsonic weapons ? \nphasers ? \nphoton cannons ? \" . \nnope , they hop out brandishing good old 1997 machine guns , pump action rifles , and tactical nuclear weapons ! \ni guess a lot of physics money r&d went into travel and not weaponry . \nas the assault begins , our group of troopers are seen walking in a straight line through a box canyon . \ntwo members of the group notice rocks slipping and falling above them , and one even sees a streak fly by , but disregards it as nothing . \nthis of course , leads to more massive carnage , blood shed , and graphic depictions of limbs and heads being ripped and severed from their bodies . \nagain , i see that military tactics in the future must have evolved at about the same pace as their weapons ! \nin the end , we see neil patrick \" doogie howser \" harris burst onto the scene in what could accurately be described as a nazi ss trenchcoat , hat , and gloves . \nhe does a vulcan mind meld on the giant slug , and then proclaims that the bugs are scared ! \nthis sets the troopers into a frenzy , as they are now one step closer to completing their goal , total genocide of a species ( again , sound familiar ? ? ) . \ni have tried very hard not to step on and spoil the plot with this review , but given it's non-existence , i may have anyway . \ni could go on for pages ripping this movie apart , but don't want to bore you too badly . \nin short , i felt as if i were subjected to a mix between a pro-nazi war film with bugs substituted for allies , a drivers education accident scene film , and a complete blank screen ( the plot , of course ) . \ni wouldn't

business in japan . \nhe meets a slinky young woman ( joan chen ) and has a torrid night of lovemaking with her -- and then manages to witness her death at the hands of an evil ninja clan and their leader ( john lone ) . \napparently they had some unfinished business that could only be concluded with her getting slaughtered . \nsince lambert is a witness , he's of course the next one to die . \nlet's stop and think about this for a second . \nif lambert were in real life being chased by fanatical devotees to a ninja secret society , he'd have a lifespan you could only measure with an atomic clock . \nin this movie , the ninja manage to kill just about everyone except him . \ni imagine the japanese gods smiled down on lambert and provided him with a goof field that radiates out about ten feet from his body . \nyou know what a goof field is : that invisible zone in which anyone who has intent to do harm to you becomes a klutz no matter what their real dexterity is . \nthis is , of course , only the beginning of the movie's problems . \nlambert eventually finds pseudo-safety with a long-haired modern-day samurai ( yoshio harada ) and his partner -- yoko shimada , who you may remember as lady toda buntaro in shogun . \nthey are the two best things in the movie ; in every scene they have authority and presence , and they actually look like they belong here , even when dressed in full samurai armor and wielding bows . \nthe script doesn't know what the hell to do with them . \nlone , as the bad guy , is zero-dimensional . \nthe only bad-guy cliche he has to wallow around in is the one about how the bad guy always has exotic women dripping off of him . \nin the hunted , this is elevated to the level of an insulting stereotype . \nwhat's funny is that the peripheral characters in the hunted are not sterotypes -- there's a nice little scene with a tokyo cabdriver , and a girl in a pachinko parlor -- but many of the main characters are unsalveageably hateful . \nalso , the phenomenal instrumental troupe kodo has assembled a superior soundtrack -- get the cd -- that manages to survive despite the drek it's been designed to accompany . \nthere is an extended battle scene in the middle of the movie that is almost reason enough to watch the whole thing -- a gory , excellently staged fight on the bullet train that shows some real imagination for a moment , and then smothers it by trying to clumsily re-couple the whole thing with the movie's relentlessly stupid plot . \nby the time we get to the final showdown , with lambert getting to wield his own sword ( which , judging from the ham-handed editing of one scene , was forged in seven hours or so ) , we no longer care . \nwe're not even given any definitive information about whether or not one of the key characters lives or dies ! \nsomeone once said that the key to good art -- good movies , good books , whatever -- is to start somewhere interesting , end up somewhere interesting , and show respect for the audience all along the way . \nthis movie bungles two out of three , badly . \n", "hello kids . \ntoday the movie studios want to take over my critical review , and somehow

for his new hair weave , costner plays a nameless drifter who dons a long dead postal employee's uniform and gradually turns a nuked-out usa into an idealized hippy-dippy society . \n ( judging by the costuming at the end of the movie , the main accomplishment of this brave new world is in re-inventing polyester . ) \nwhen he's not pointing the camera directly at himself , director costner does have a nice visual sense , and it is undeniably fascinating to see such an unabashedly jingoistic film in the trust-no-one 90's ; but by the time the second hour rolled around , i was reduced to sitting on my hands to keep from clawing out my own eyes . \nmark this one \" return to sender \" . \n", "starring ben stiller , elizabeth hurley , maria bello , janeane garofalo screenplay by david veloz , based on the novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz \npermanent midnight is a pretty bad movie , though it took me a few days to conclude this . \nthe film is more masturbatory than bleak , with its main character intent on confounding us with his stupidity . \n ( he has a $6000 a week drug habit . ) \nultimately , as adapted by veloz , jerry stahl comes off as one of those playground braggarts who chainsmokes at the age of twelve ; you are less mystified by his self-destructive nature than bored into a stupor yourself . \nben stiller plays stahl , a young author who arrives in l . a . with ambition and a nasty drug habit . \nhe eventually gets a gig for $5000/week writing for a sitcom called mr . chompers ( a thinly veiled stand-in for \" alf \" : chompers looks just like alf except he's blue ) , marries a producer ( hurley ) so she can get a green card , and hooks up with a spanish mother ( liz torres ) , who shoots heroin with him in the afternoons . \ninsert proverbial downward spiral here . \npermanent midnight is structured mostly as a flashback , with recovering addict bello meeting stiller ( at a fastfood restaurant , where stiller works the drive-thru as part of rehab ) , taking him back to a hotel , and between bouts of serious screwing , listening to his life story . \ni've spent the last week trying to figure out why stiller never seemed to find the frighteningly gorgeous hurley attractive-worse , i've been trying to figure out why hurley did find stiller attractive . \nas stahl , stiller displays none of the charm or wit one would expect ( post-there's something about mary ) of either the actor or a comedy writer . \nwhat separates stahl from the hundreds of other hollywood punk-junkies , it seems , is that stahl wrote a book about his idiocy . \nwatch stahl shoot heroin next to a baby ! \nwatch stahl spoil numerous pitch meetings with smack-fueled babble ! \nstiller gives a technically flawless performance : the film could double as a documentary on how to be a junkie . \nbut permanent midnight is mostly soulless . \nwhen the movie poses the question will stahl be saved ? \nand then answers it in the form of bello's character ( basically a shrink in black panties ) , could a person care less ? \nin the film version of his autobiography of the same name , stahl doesn't need saving , he needs someone who will sit there and listen to him go on about himself . \nif you learn anything about the other characters in this movie , it's that they are the most incredibly tolerant hollywood-types known to man . \n ( stahl also seems to be the only person at schmooze parties doing drugs . \nis this hollywood . . . california ? ) \ni learned very little about the entertainment business from permanent midnight and a whole lot about an egotistical lunkhead . \nof course you know that stahl triumphed because he lived to talk about his problems . \nso , basically , his drug habit got him a book deal , a movie based on his life , and now he's apparently collaborating with stiller on future projects . \nso much for the moral of that story . \ntemporary midnight is more like it . \n-bill chambers ; september

fear , which is a pretty good sign that you're not watching the thriller that the director had originally envisioned . \nrather , you adopt the opinion that the characters are so goofy and so unaware of the trouble that they're in , that you stop caring about who lives , who dies and where the story goes . \ninstead , you become more interested in how the characters get killed off . \nthe four young teenagers who are the potential sacrificial lambs for this movie are helen and barry and julie and ray - two couples and dear friends to one another . \nduring the summer just after high school graduation , they take a fateful drive down a dark mountain highway . \nsuddenly , without warning , their car hits someone whom the teens presume was killed as a result of that collision . \nfearing jail time and possible manslaughter charges if they confess , they instead decide to dump the body into the ocean and make a pact never to discuss the episode again . \na year goes by and things among the four friends begin to change . \nrelationships fizzle , future dreams crumble , and attitudes change . \nbut , they can not forget what they did . \nand apparently , neither can someone else . \nsomeone begins to send letters to all four of the teens with the frightening message : \" i know what you did last summer . \" \nthe letter-writer ( a figure in a rubber slicker wielding a large metal hook ) soon makes his presence known and begins to hunt down the four teens . \nit's now up to the four of them to try to figure out who the killer is before it's too late . \nwhile this movie has some nice visually eerie effects , too much of it's impact had to be generated with extreme close-ups , while the level of suspense was choppy at best . \nthere is so much more that this movie could have been , but decided to give us nothing but cheap thrills . \nit could have been a clever whodunit , but discovering who ultimately was the killer made me just shrug my shoulders . \nit could have explored the changed friendships after a year of adulthood , but seemed to only include that aspect to add 15 more minutes to the film . \nit could have given us smarter characters who knew that anytime you're alone and you see shadowy figures moving about , you don't walk towards them yelling \" hello \" . \nonce you yell \" hello \" , you can expect an extreme close-up , a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse . \nit's difficult to be in suspense when you know what's about to happen . \nthe only redeeming aspect of the movie is that i now have a neat idea for a halloween costume , but i'm not sure if the local costume store sells rubber slickers and hooks . \nthe horror that i experienced from this film is realizing that i actually went to see it . \n", " \" goodbye , lover \" sat on the shelf for almost a year since its lukewarm reception at the cannes film festival last may , and one look will tell you why . \nit's a mess . \nand that's * way * before ellen degeneres shows up . \nthe film is one of those torrid double-indemnity crime stories that , in this case , required the services of three screenwriters . \ni suspect that one wrote a sexy thriller , one wrote a murder mystery , and one wrote a comedy , then director roland joff ? tried to piece it all together in the editing room while scratching his head in bewilderment . \ni didn't laugh at ellen degeneres much ( i think i was supposed to ) . \ndegeneres is horrible and her character is even worse , a tough-talking vulgar cop with a bad wardrobe and bad hair . \neither degeneres is wearing a wig--as most of the actors appear to be--or she doesn't yet have enough clout to secure a hairstylist . \nevery single word out of her mouth is supposed to be racy and hip , but her incessant wisecracking is poorly-written and merely stupid . \nher reaction to the brutal killing of a jogger is \" at least she died healthy . \" \nand that's one of her wittier asides . \ndegeneres' sgt . \nrita pompano is called in to investigate the allegedly accidental death of . . . wait . \nto give away too much of the plot would all but ruin a film that has very little going for it outside of its numbing plot twists and multiple triple-crosses . \nit's best described this way : \nsultry sexpot/real estate agent sandra dunmore ( patricia arquette ) is married to jake , a \" creative yet unfocused \" ( and alcoholic ) advertising rep , played by dermot mulroney . \nsandra likes to act out her deep-seated sexual fantasies and jake's brother ben ( the suave-as-ever don johnson ) likes to help . \nben is also coming on to his petite , mousy co-worker peggy blaine ( mary-louise parker ) and someone , somewhere , is planning to cash in on that huge life insurance policy of his . \nthe film is ripe with cheating lovers cheating on each other and back again . \nalthough there are some genuine surprises , the plot twists get too contrived too quickly . \nprobably around the time degeneres' gumcracking gumshoe appears . \nat least the former \" ellen \" star is going for something a little different . \narquette turns in yet another of her stiletto-heeled , platinum blonde bombshell roles ( see : \" lost highway , \" \" true romance \" ) while quoting embarrassing lines like \" i'm not wearing any underwear . \" \ni hope she got paid a lot of money to do this . \nhere's an example of some of the film's flat-out stupidity . \nsandra purchases a used car and disguises herself in a red wig prior to stalking two of the film's duplicitous lovers . \nshe drives the motorbiking couple off a cliff while blaring her favorite \" the sound of music \" on her car stereo , intent on identifying herself to her hapless victims . \nso what was the point of the wig and the car ? \n \" the sound of music \" stuff might be a reference to \" the wizard of oz \" allusions in david lynch's \" wild at heart , \" but if so joff ? must have forgotten that \" wild at heart \" was a despicable movie . \nit's hard to believe that \" goodbye , lover \" was directed by the same person who made \" the killing fields \" and \" the mission . \" \nit's not , however , hard to see why it sat on the shelf for so long . \nit should have stayed there . \n", "as with any gen-x mtv movie ( like last year's dead man on campus ) , the movie is marketed for a primarily male audience as indicated by its main selling points : sex and football . \nthose two items , wrapped in a guilty-pleasure package , are sure to snare a sizeable box office chunk initially , but sales will decline for two reasons . \nfirst , the football sequences are nothing new , nor can they be ; the sports genre isn't mainstream and it's been retread to death . \nsecond , the sex is just bad . \ndespite the appearance of a whipped cream bikini or the all-night strip-club party , there's nothing even remotely tantalizing . \nthe acting is mostly mediocre , not including the fantastic jon voight . \ncultivating his usual sliminess , voight gives an unexpectedly standout performance as west canaan coyotes head coach bud kilmer . \nkilmer is the driving force behind the coyotes' twenty-two conference championships and two state titles in thirty years ; this year he plans to make it twenty-three . \nunfortunately , when his star quarterback , lance harbor ( paul walker ) , goes down for the count , he's got to rely on the unreliable abilities of backup john moxon ( james van der beek ) . \nmoxon leads the team through its last four games , and then must cope with his newfound stardom , the effect it has on his relationship with girlfriend julie ( amy smart ) , and other temptations that abound in football-crazy west canaan . \nmost regions of the country are not nearly as football-crazy as texas , and so the atmosphere is likely to be lost on most . \nsimilarly , the set design is wrong for a high school setting : the teams are decked out with sparkling uniforms , radio headsets ( which never seem to work , however , and instead require coaches to signal plays manually ) , and even a giant bronze statue of coach kilmer . \nthese elements ( as well as the heavy drinking and carousing ) might be more appropriate on a college campus -- but mtv's core audience is the high school demographic . \nthis focus is further emphasized by the casting : james van der beek , of tv's \" dawson's creek , \" is an understandable choice for the reluctant hero , although he never manages to do anything with the role . \nother stars are similarly young and unmemorable . \nthere's not much that goes right about varsity blues , and there's not much to like about it , either . \neverything herein has already been done , and if it hasn't , the movie manages to botch it one way or another . \nthis is certainly missable . \n", "nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink-and-a-concussive-nudge bombast-o-rama con air . \nthe opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe , a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill-fated bar-room brawl . \nthe prison scenes are accompanied by voice-overs in which poe , in a languid southern drawl , describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met . \nif the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity , it probably should . \ncage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim-witted and ridiculous , and that he's going to have to do something to keep himself entertained . \nand thus he slips into a familiar , surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings -- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed-up version of raising arizona's h . i . mcdonnough . \ncage should have known what he was getting himself into . \nhe got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock , and if there's one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production ( even without his late partner don simpson ) , it's that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the _last_ bruckheimer production . \nthe critical difference between the rock and con air is cage's performance . \nin the rock , cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time . \nthat sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self-awareness . \nwhile the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home , cage's goal is different but just as simple : to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact . \naudiences , too , should know what they're getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production . \nin fact , the marketing people are counting on it . \nno one who loathed the rock for its swear-grunt-blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air ; no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded . \ndirector simon west ( yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab's soda fountain ) delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline/testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture ( it's perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma ; like insulin , con air does the work of a gland ) . \nwhat he doesn't deliver is a moment of suspense . \na bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock's notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk ; a really , _really_ big desk and a really , _really_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely . \nif either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension , they might have done something with con air's creepiest set-up . \nat a desert stop for the plane-load of convicts , serial killer garland greene ( steve buscemi ) wanders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool . \ntheir tete-a-tete is eerie and menacing , providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains ( danny trejo , ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them ) . \nin fact , con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement -- too many characters , too much editing , too many dopey punch lines , too much of the cheap , ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts . \nit is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance . \nwhile malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack ( as a u . s . marshal ) goes for earnest , cage looks like he just wants to go to sleep . \nhis recycled raising arizona performance is a means of escape , his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit of that big box of huggies . \nit doesn't bode well for cage's appearance in face/off later this month ; perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over and over . \nthere's a word for people like you , nicolas . \nthat word is called recidivist . . . repeat \noffender . \n", "a big house . \na big director , jan de bont of speed and twister fame .

but on the whole , it took waaaaay too long to get going , provided very little meat in the plot , went way past its own bedtime , and basically relied on grunts , the muttering of children's voices and over-the-top special effects , to scare us . \nwell , this film didn't do much for me . \nand they might as well have called it the \" haunting of lily taylor \" , since she's basically the only character who had any real depth , background or reason to be in the house in the first place . \ndon't get me wrong , catherine zeta was sweet window dressing ( despite my continued perception of her faint mustache-see entrapment ) , and owen wilson was good as the standard \" comic relief \" , but come on people , if you're going to have us sit through two hours in a theater with these folks , how 'bout giving them a little more than one-liners as dimension . \nneeson was also wasted as the smart , british guy . \nit's all too sad , cause certainly the \" idea \" seemed like a good one ( see the shining ( 9/10 ) for a close to perfect example of a creepy gone awry ) , but the story was thin , the conclusion was laughable ( be gone . . . poof ! ) and the special effects ? \nwell , they sure were nice to look at , but not for a moment did one of them scare , or even for a split-second , have me believe that they were anything more than hollywood special gadgetry . \nsee it for

end of a film . \nthat about sums up the dreadful ugliness of 102 dalmatians , a cold pea soup of cute animals , stupid home alone antics , a boring puppy love subplot between dumb humans , and glenn close reprising her best joan crawford impression . \nindeed , walt disney is rolling over in his grave again , cursing john hughes' name for making the original live-action 101 dalmatians , one of the worst kiddie flicks of all time , and now its sequel . \nthe main culprit behind the hideousness of 102 dalmatians is its predecessor , 101 dalmatians . \nthe original made more than $100 million dollars at the box office , spawned a torrid collection of \" collectible \" items that ended up months later in the discount bins of wal-marts across the country , and generally made every kid on the planet want a damn dalmatian pup for christmas . \nwell , it's been about four years since then , and dalmatian fever is coming back , and this time it's digitally enhanced . \nhere's the story . \ncruella de vil ( glenn close ) is released from prison due to the \" cure \" of her puppy homicide urges by one dr . pavlov . \n ( oh , how witty . ) \nshe rejoins the world as a dog lover and is assigned to a probation officer , who oddly turns out to be her victim from the original film . \ncruella then becomes ella -- dog lover -- until the plot twists , like a dog with his leash caught on the back of a moving truck , and she becomes the evil vixen again . \na kidnapping plot unfurls again as cruella decides she still needs her dalmatian coat , but she now needs 102 dalmatians instead of the commonly used 101 dalmatian formula . \nat this point , i was envying those kids filing out of the theater . \nhow low have glenn close and gerard depardieu ( as the film's villain ) sunk in

it from stalling . \nit's clunky and slow , like watching an 18-wheeler trying to accelerate up a hill . \nthere are certainly better things you can do with your time . \nactually , if you've seen the trailer , then you already know the plot and have seen its funniest moments . \nthe story centers on bland marvin ( rob schneider ) , who is an evidence clerk at the local police department that yearns to be a real officer . \nbut he's afflicted with loser-itis . \ndogs attack him , neighbors torment him , children bully him , and his co-workers ignore him . \ntruthfully , with his bad haircut ( seemingly modeled after weird al yankovic , little richard , and giant poodles ) and his unenthusiastic demeanor , we'd probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun . \nthis is actually bad because you can't like a character if you can't develop sympathy for him . \nwe never do , and it may be just as well that he drives off a cliff and plummets to the canyon floor . \nhowever , marvin is found by an eccentric doctor ( michael caton ) who uses a radical and experimental procedure to save him , implanting our doofus with various animal parts and organs . \nas a result , marvin develops heightened senses and increased agility and speed . \nhe can smell drugs hidden anywhere on a body , swim with the speed of a dolphin , and can run as fast as a cheetah . \nimagine the comedic possibilities that arise from this operation . \nwith his enhanced abilities , he could now reap vengeance on all those who have shunned him . \nhowever , the spirit of the film takes a raunchy turn , and instead , marvin spends most of his time trying to subdue or satiate his voracious appetite and his animalistic , sexual urges . \ngoats beware ! \nhe also chases cats , urinates to mark his territory , or growls at his enemies . \nwhat he should've done was stick his head in the sand like an ostrich . \nequally tenuous is its other running joke , which involves one of his friends ( guy torry ) who constantly complains that everyone is treating him too nicely because he's black . \n \" it's reverse racism , \" he declares as he blows smoke into the faces of strangers but none of them says anything . \nthis element doesn't work the first time it's mentioned , and it becomes increasingly trite with every recurrence . \nyou don't have to be as wise as an owl to realize that \" the animal \" is tame . \nif there's any reason to see this film , it's to see colleen haskell who makes her big screen debut . \nremember her ? \nshe was voted off in week 11 of the 13-week program , \" survivor . \" \nhere , she plays marvin's sunny love interest . \nwhile her role required very little actual acting , she seemed very comfortable ( even when marvin licks the side of her face like a lapping dog . . . yuck ! ) . \nwith her adorable disposition , radiant smile , and playful innocence , she could be a meg ryan in the making . \nit's too bad that she's in such a mediocre offering \n", "romeo is bleeding wants to carry the unusual flavor of reservoir dogs or bad lieutenant . \nwith director peter medak , whose previous credits include the good films let him have it and the krays , and top-notch character actors gary oldman and lena olin , they seemed likely to be a successful combination . \nthose mentioned films , however , brought something to the screen that romeo is bleeding did not : a solid , well-written screenplay . \ncall me cynical , but the jobs of writer and producer don't seem to mix well . \ngary oldman plays jack grimaldi , a good cop turned bad , selling information to the mob and cheating on his wife . \nhis cheating is obvious enough to obtain his nickname , although the name doesn't provide any insight or analogy to the shakespearean character . \njack has become addicted to \" feeding the hole \" , a hole in the ground where he stores his payoff money . \nwhen he realizes his colleagues are being shot , he feebly attempts to get out . \ngary oldman's performance is disappointingly weak ; he seems nearly bored . \nin the process , he also gets tangled-up with mona demarkov , a russian mobsterette who wants to take over the territory from top boss falcone , played adequately by roy scheider . \ndemarkov , played by lena olin , is a tough but tremendously sexy woman with seemingly no problems maneuvering within the mob world . \nthis character is combination of both linda hamilton and arnold schwarznegger from terminator 2 . i can't remember seeing a character quite like her . \nafter being shot , handcuffed , and thrown in the back seat of a car , she still manages to cause an accident , kick out the windshield with her legs , grab a suitcase full of money ( plus some important documentation ) , climb through the rubble , land on her shot leg , and still succeed at running for safety . \nwhat a woman ! \nlena olin's performance is the only glimmer in this dismal film . \nanabella sciorra is wasted in her role as romeo's wife . \nthere is little insight into her character . \nshe's depressed , she makes obvious references , she mopes around the house . \njuliette lewis , as romeo's girlfriend , is treated with the same cliche attitudes , although ms . lewis' portrayal certainly didn't improve it . \nboth women were anything but sexy or attractive . \npoorly developed characters aside , the screenplay also suffers from several logistical problems . \nit is so discouraging to watch a film and want to shout at the main character ( not ) to do something . \nfor example , jack and his friends attend a funeral to hang in the background to scope-out the mob scene . \nfine . \njack spots the big boss with his goons by the gravesite . \nfine . \nwhat does jack proceed to do ? \nhe brushes his friends off by telling them he isn't feeling well , then strolls over to the boss . \nwhy ? \nthe boss had all ready threatened him ; falcone simply takes the opportunity to issue more threats by ordering his goons to take off some of jack's toes by the gravesite . \ni guess they weren't worried about any federal agents lingering around after the funeral . . . . \nor here's another : demarkov set-up her own death by cutting off her arm with a circular saw . \nshe proceeded to set the place on fire . \nwouldn't the flames burn off the fingerprints ? \naren't dental records more important ? \nas bright and resourceful as she was supposed to be , couldn't she come up with a better plot ? \n ( and it took her no time at all to get a good-fitting , functional prosthesis . ) \nlack of attention to detail certainly adds up in a film . \nthis film doesn't even add up the large details . \nthere is little or no consistency in the story-line . \nnot much makes sense . \nthe direction lacks cohesion , surprising from a director whose previous credits are impeccable . \nthe moods shift , the styles shift , and no one can seem to decide if it is a serious film or satire of one . \nso while it certainly isn't reservoir dogs , it certainly isn't diva . \nthere's plenty more to tear apart in this film . \nmy advice to someone who hasn't seen it to to wait until it comes on video . \nthere are some quotable lines that would provide a campy evening if not taken seriously . \nit's not a boring film , just not a good one . \nor an intelligent one . \n", "54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . \na greater writer might have created a lyrical sentence for each of those adjectives , flowing in lovely arangements with soaring metaphors . \ni , however , would rather cut to the chase . \n54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . \nthere is nothing in it -- not a glimpse of depth , nor a shimmer of intelligence or insight . \nthere is no electricity in any of the scenes , or a moment of interest in the story or its subplots . \nand it's underdeveloped , and features an array of bland characters played by actors who think they're in this year's boogie nights . \nthey are so wrong . \nthe picture has been assembled by mark christopher . \nbased on this film , i don't know how he got a job in the business . \n54 is supposed to be an amazing insight into the world of the dance club of the same name , which originated in the 70s and closed down in the 80s . \ni don't know if this film went into production after boogie nights was released , but christopher has managed to plagiarize paul thomas anderson's brilliant work in every possible way , from the framework of the plot down to the style of the cinematography . \nwhat it lacks is everything that made boogie nights great : depth , intelligence , energy , fascinating characters , and challenging themes . \n54 can't even measure up to the last days of disco , which is flawed , but still smart and entertaining . \nit's remarkably bad timing , i'd say , to release a film this tedious after a couple of noteworthy pictures of the same kind . \ni have exaggerated , though : there is one interesting character , and one terrific performance . \nthat character is steve rubell , played with more perceptiveness by mike myers than this limp production deserves . \nsteve rubell is the owner of studio 54 , and if christopher had focused on him , then myers could have forced a good film out of this wreck all by himself . \nalas , we are instead guided to endure the trials of a young man named shane ( ryan phillippe ) , a going-nowhere new jersey teen who gets a job in the club , thanks to rubell's homosexual impulses . \nit's here that he meets his friends , the array of uninteresting characters : his co-worker , greg ( brecklin meyer ) , his wife , anita ( salma hayek ) , and , of course , the love interest , julie black ( neve campbell ) . \nshane is just an innocent young fool in the beginning , and he has a reasonably sturdy home life . \n ( some of the scenes with his father border on interesting , while heather matarazzo , who plays his sister , pushes phillippe off the screen . ) \nbut he decides to envelop himself in the disco scene , and succumb to peer pressure and to drugs . \nwhy his \" friends \" push him into drugs is never really explained , but the fact that they are \" friends \" is questioned only is superficial ways ( greg gets really mad at shane because he's been elevated to bartender status ) . \nthere isn't a single conflict that takes center stage , except that shane has some kind of unexplored reservation with the business in which he works . \nmost of the film is dumb , and most of the dialogue is inane . \nthere's a scene late in the film in which shane confronts julie black , and , in the next scene , they're arm-in-arm without a bit of development . \nthen , they're kissing in a bowling alley ! \nthis is five minutes of material , thrown into the picture at the last minute ( well past the one-hour mark , and this isn't a long film to begin with ) . \ncampbell is a talented actress , but she needs a role that gives her a little depth . \nthis one doesn't . \nand phillippe has almost no presence whatsoever ; this performance pales in comparison to mark whalberg's star-making role in boogie nights . \nhe seems dumb and misguided , and his voice never changes tone . \ni guess he was picked for the color of his hair and the shape of his body , but he seems pretty lanky to me . \nhe's all wrong for a lead role , but it doesn't help that christopher has forgotten to develop his characters . \nby the end of 54 , shane's most notable trait is his stupid , fake accent . \nthe rest of the performances are wasted . \nhayek is an energetic , talented young actress , and does almost nothing here . \nmeyer is endearing , but allowed to be no deeper than cardboard . \nonly myers , by sheer force of talent , manages to rise above christopher's wading-pool of a script . \nrubell has been written just as depthless as the rest of the characters , but myers is good enough to inject subtleties that help round out the performance . \nin fact , myers is the sole reason to see 54 , and all it really does is make you wish that the film had revolved around him . \ni've read that studio 54 has been recreated down to the last detail . \nfrankly , i don't care . \nit's easy to recreate something technical like this . \na fairly skilled production designer and a few carpenters can manage such a task . \nbesides , christopher keeps the lights so low that the sets are invisible , anyway . \naside from myers' performance , 54 is a complete failure . \nit's dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . \nsome may find my comparisons to boogie nights unfair , but they're so obvious to me . \nin any event , 54 is pallid without the contrast . \nit doesn't even work as mindless entertainment : it's so shallow that the most escapist viewers are likely to dismiss it . \nso , don't forget those key words : dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . \neverything else i said was just padding . \n", "an experience like baby geniuses can have certain effects on an average moviegoer . \nyou may be scarred for life after seeing this petrified piece of garbage , which is so disarmingly horrible that it may cause you to ponder it's hollywood existence . \nwhen i think of the screenwriters behind this film , i picture a room full of monkeys . \nthe monkeys are pounding on their typewriters while scratching themselves . \nall of the monkeys combine their efforts , hop in a cab and take the finished product downtown to director bob clark's

down on the desktop and exclaims `i love it ! ! ! ' \nthe writing behind this project is embarrassing . \nfor your amusement , i will explain the plot . \ndr . kinder ( kathleen turner ) and dr . heep ( christopher lloyd ) are two of the cold-hearted executives at the baby geniuses institute , where peculiar studies are going on . \nas the story goes , there is an ancient myth explaining that babies ( ages 2 and under ) know all the secrets of the world from previous life experiences . \nwhen they move past this phase , they become like any other drooling toddler . \nkinder and heep want to unlock the secrets using their test babies , namely little sylvester ( sly for short ) , who can break in or out of any given situation so efficiently that he would be right at home on the mission : impossible team . \nthere is so much crap derived from this premise , despite the fact it's virtually identical to the plot in look who's talking ! \n ( a far superior film in any league ) . \nyou will be able to determine the quality of the film by examining the opening scene . \nsylvester has broken out and managed to elude several security guards with his amazing intellect and kung-fu tactics . \nquestion : it's obvious the babies are super-smart , but why are they able to fight like jackie chan ? ? \nthe adults in this film are furiously beaten by these youngsters in diapers . \nit's a shock when writers will stoop this low just to draw cheap laughs by using john hughes' familiar home alone formula . \ni also found it disturbing that the babies in this film have attitude and endless 90's knowledge , quoting numerous movies and insulting their adult captors . \nthe effects in baby geniuses ( similar to the talking animals in babe ) are pathetic , the editing is a disaster , and the jokes are never funny . \nthe only reason viewers may avoid vomiting is the argument that the babies are `cute' . \ni suppose they are . \ni can admit to smiling a few times because the babies were cute . \nother instances , though , i was howling in laughter due to the inane stupidity of the script . \nthere are supporting characters who have no personality whatsoever ; their entire existence is based on punch lines . \npeter macnicol and kim cattrall , as an unwilling couple who have adopted sylvester's twin , are both miscast . \nthen again , i don't suppose any performer could handle the uneven material without looking incredibly stupid . \nmeanwhile , dom deluise plays a fellow who gets hit in the crotch with a monkey wrench ( hahaha ) . \ni would avoid baby geniuses at all costs . \ninstead of watching this , i would recommended filling your bathtub with cement and going snorkeling . \nor perhaps you would consider going diving in shark-infested waters . \nanything to avoid this painful movie . \nthe final line in the film , spoken by the bratty sylvester , is `if they think i'm doing the sequel for less than $20 mill , they're nuts' . \nsequel ? \nplease have mercy . \n", " \" houston . we have a serious problem . \" \nafter making \" mission : impossible \" , brian de palma has a lot to live up to . \nby making an epic science fiction and inviting great cast and talented crew , he hopes to reach the modern audience . \nand the possibilities are certainly there , but the result is a great disaster . \nstarting in a near future , with a prologue copied from \" apollo 13 \" , de palma slowly builds up his \" story \" . \nthe human race has already set foot on mars . \na research expedition has vanished without trace on the red planet and another one has been sent to find out what happened . \nthis is basically the whole plot . \nso it's hard to imagine that it can be stretched to 2 hours . \nbut de palma manages to do that . \nit is not a very good achievement . \nas we follow this expedition to mars and watch them slowly float in space , the hardest thing to do is stay awake . \nthe film's major problem is that it tries to seem more clever than it is . \ndavid mamet's dialogue , while trying to seem natural , is distant and simply fake . \nde palma and mamet wanted to combine action with a thought provoking plot . \nthe result is more like an unsuccessful mutation of kubrick's \" 2001 : a space odyssey \" , \" apollo 13 \" and \" godzilla \" . \nto make time pass , the creators have inserted several \" refreshing \" scientific details , that would not convince a half-crazed frog . \nit consists of multiple copies and direct ripp-offs from several great science fiction films and stories . \nwhen it finally presents an almost original idea , it falls flat because of its uncovered stupidity . \ni can't even call this film predictable , since no one with a healthy imagination can come up with something like this . \nsometimes it gets so cheesy , that you'll start laughing when you're supposed to cry and cry when you're supposed to laugh . \nyou'll see enormous sandstorms , hear mysterious sounds and , last but not least , on this \" constantly surprising \" tour you'll see -- an alien . \nit's really hard to find comparisons to such an experience , and i know that i've never said that before ( i thought i never would ) , but \" lost in space \" is actually better . \nthat's an achievement in itself ! \ndirector brian de palma has stroke gold with \" untouchables \" that became an instant american classic . \nit is for this film that he will be remembered , while all his other failures will be forgotten . \nhe'll live to fight another day ! \ni send the actors my condolences , since they truly do try to transform into their undeveloped and dull characters . \nand both the cinematography , production design and art direction are very decent . \nit is because of the achievement of 254 people , that i rate this film 2/10 . \nunfortunately their hard work was in vain . \nif you have problems with insomnia , i recommend you this film . \nif you're not asleep within the first half hour , consult your doctor . \n", "gun wielding arnold schwarzenegger has a change of heart by the film's end and becomes a believer in god instead of a skeptic , going through an amazing transformation by having a christian epiphany in the final scene as he becomes someone who can now beat the devil by his faith alone . . . this is after two hours of throwing people out windows and shooting more people than your average serial killer . \nnobody can save this bomb from it's own stupidity and arrogance in filmmaking and arrogance in believing that this is a positive religious-type of film . \nit's just a pile of dreck . . . an \nill-conceived exploitive project , a pyrotechnical film . \n \" end of days \" aims to be an apocalyptic thriller . \nit features an idiotic script , a hack director , and a one-dimensional star who is past his prime . . . which \nmakes this film dumber than dumb , plus it's not funny , not campy , or is it in the least bit entertaining . \nit's just dreary and unwatchable . . . a \nbig-budget slasher film . \narnold plays an alcoholic security guard who finds his new mission in life is to stop satan ( occupying gabriel byrne's body and possessing a wall st . bank account ) from destroying the world . \nthe film opens in vatican city , roma 1979 -- where the pope is alerted by a young visionary priest tomaso , looking out at the night sky and seeing a comet whiz by , who proclaims after looking at his scrolls -- that's the sign for the 'eye of god , ' which reveals that a child has been born who is being prepared to give birth to satan's baby ( the anti-christ ) in the hour before the new century begins , when satan will fuck her and open up the gates to hell on earth . \ntomaso has some twenty years to find this woman and save her and the world from doom . \nbut some in the pope's circle want to kill her if found , even though the pope insists on having faith and letting her live , as he lectures them : \" even in the world's darkest days -- doing evil doesn't stop evil , but brings on more evil . \" \nwe saw the girl being born in nyc in 1979 , which seems to be the 'logical' place to look for satan according to the astrology charts of the visionaries . \nthe chosen woman is christine york ( robin ) . \nit is now a few days before the new year celebration for 2000 and arnold and his wise-cracking security guard partner kevin pollack are hired to guard a wall street turd , and when he is fired upon by a renograde priest , thomas aquinas , arnold saves him and through a ridiculous chase captures the tongue less priest who fired the shot . \nhe , nevertheless , can speak and tells arnold an 'end of days' is coming as prophesized in revelations . \nbut satan gets to him in his hospital room and nails him to the ceiling while scribbling latin warnings of 'the end of the world' on his body . \nit is now up to arnold to save the world and find the chosen woman . \nhe quickly finds christine and does everything to protect her from all the evil forces around her , as the film includes ludicrous helicopter rescues , people jumping out of windows , satan taking a piss and dropping a match to kill arnold's partner as the piss explodes like gasoline , satan being fired at . . . resulting in his sometimes experiencing pain and sometimes nothing , as if the director forgot which way he wants to have it . \nthere is nothing spared in nyc from fire bombs -- including the subway , churches , and luxury buildings . \nthe only trouble with all these high-budget action sequences , was that it lacked purpose and even entertainment value . \nthe story was so terrible and inaccurate , that it did not have an iota of value or credibility . \nmercifully the movie drags to a final confrontation in times square , trying unsuccessfully to build tension to the countdown toward the year 2000 . \nwhy is the end of 1999 considered to be the devil's number \" 666 , '' well !

i say , you can give mariah carey a movie , but that certainly don't mean it should be done . \nsure , there are plenty of pop star film vehicles out there -- from the beatles' a hard day's night to the spice girls' spice world -- but none have been so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter . \neverything about this complete tripe is ludicrous . \nstart off with the story , which -- as gruesomely predictable as it is -- is the least offensive part of the movie . \nthe film is inexplicably set in the 80s , a period piece that really shows no sign of its period except for a few chicks in leg warmers . \nworse yet , everyone's speaking late 90s hip-hop slang in what should be 1983 . \nmeant to be partially autobiographical , carey plays billie frank , a young singer in new york who

billie's first music video -- go over like lead balloons . \ninstead , the audience at my screening tended to laugh loudest during mariah's most dramatic scenes . \nwhich brings us to the performances , of which there's nothing good that can be said . \nmariah is primarily seen with a wide-eyed deer-in-the-headlights look frozen on her face . \nshe actually looks scared during her one love scene .

to pull it off with aplomb . \neven the characters couldn't have been written more absurdly . \nthey're all members of a barbie playset : the important film director who swoons , \" billie , i'd love to put you in a movie i'm making , \" and the big-time record executive who takes billie's demo tape and says , \" oh , i'll make sure the whole team listens to it in the morning . \" \neveryone in

suggesting that \" patch adams \" was tossed out just to rake in the bucks . \nmy guess is that someone was asleep at the wheel . \nit features an accomplished actor and a potentially engrossing story , but it's as dull as could be . \nhunter \" patch \" adams' ( robin williams ) desire to become a doctor has an unusual genesis . \nchecking himself into a mental institute after a suicide attempt , he discovers that he can help the other patients by clowning around . \npatch could be a poster boy for co-dependency . \nhe explains that he likes devoting himself to others because then he doesn't focus on his own problems . \nhe decides that he wants to be a physician , leaves the place and a couple of years later enrolls in the medical college of virginia . \nas a med student , patch's antics at the school's hospital catch the attention of his soon to be arch-enemy , straight-laced dean walcott ( bob gunton ) . \nthe dean is so opposed to the goofiness that he wants patch kicked out of school although he's one of the top students . \nhe writes in patch's academic file that he shows \" excessive happiness . \" \ni walked into the film knowing little about its history and wondered about its odd mechanical pacing . \nthere also seemed to be no reason that it is set in the early seventies . \nthen it struck me . \nit must be based on a true story . \nthe movie is an adaptation of a book by hunter adams who founded the gesundheit institute , a free clinic . \nrobin williams is an amazing actor . \nwhile he is adept at dramatic roles , his forte is over-the-top free spirits . \nthat's what makes his failure here so remarkable . \npatch is exactly the character he should be best at , yet even the scene where he and another mental patient are battling fierce imaginary squirrels falls flat . \nsomething holds him back . \nmost of the rest of the cast is two-dimensional . \nfor a film that champions seeing patients as human beings , it's curious that the ones here are cardboard characters . \npeter coyote as a man dying of cancer is refreshing because he seems like a real person . \nunfortunately he's in the film for only about two minutes . \nthe audience is

the humanity of all . \nit has as much emotion as his earlier statement \" humans are the only animal that kills members of its own species \" contains truth . \nmost of the blame must be placed with the director tom shadyac and screenwriter steve oedekerk . \nshadyac also directed the first \" ace ventura \" movie . \noedekerk directed the second one . \nneed i say more ? \nthe real adams is to be admired for his devotion to treating patients as people rather than diseases . \nthe film has a number of worthy messages about the state of the modern medical business with hmos and managed care .

\nyoung einstein sprang from the twisted mind of yahoo serious , who not only wrote , produced , edited , and directed the film , but also starred and did his own stunts . \nhis creation is about as stupid and contrived as you'd expect from someone named yahoo . \nthe movie takes substantial historical liberties in recreating einstein's youth . \nwhereas the scientist actually hailed from germany

leaves you wondering whether you are watching a movie or a music video . \nthe instrumental score , on the other hand , is generally playful ; yahoo uses such classics as the \" 1812 overture \" and

put my finger on why : the comedy takes its roots not from whimsical film fantasies ( such as young sherlock holmes ) but from cheesy prime-time sitcoms . \nin fact , young einstein might have been

sergeant jock strapp ( jack douglas ) visit turpin's area of influence to bring him to justice . \nthey are under the express orders of sir roger daley ( bernard bresslaw ) . \ntheir intellect does not count for much and when they increasingly become suspicious of reverend flasher aka dick turpin ( sid james ) , whom they confided in earlier , they still cannot believe that the rector has any part in these robberies . \nhowever , once they catch harriett and put her in jail , and sir roger daley takes complete charge , it seems that there is no hope for dick turpin . \nthen again , sir roger has assigned the dimwits fancey and jock strapp aswell as the old dithering constable ( kenneth connor ) to keep an eye on their prisoner ! \nthere is no doubt that this is a 'sid james' carry on movie . \nhe excels in double roles ( as in 'carry on- don't lose your head' ) and his performance as flasher and turpin is hilarious . \nbarbara windsor is also funny as harriett the sex mad housemaid and member of the gang , and hattie jacques' small but effective role as the rector's housekeeper martha hoggett is played to perfection . \njack douglas plays a milder version of his excruciatingly annoying on-screen persona and kenneth williams is given a rather mundane part . \npeter butterworth is not allowed to shine in his boring performance as tom , and bernard bresslaw's character appears only briefly in the film . \nthe only notable performance from the support cast comes from joan sims as madame desiree , who is travelling around the country escorting her starlets the 'birds of paradise' and sporting a fake french accent . \nwhen her girls and her are robbed by turpin , she is determined to catch him and helps the reverend to find the culprit ! \na carry on by the numbers , this movie is only notable for the great performance by sid james in his last carry on movie . \nthe jokes are bluer , the script is poorer ( it is the last script written by talbot rothwell ) , but the music is a marked improvement . \nalthough nearly all the regulars appear , they seem to be just going through the motions . \nnone of the high spirits of the earlier films are apparent here . \njust a selection of crude jokes and repititive double-entendres . \n", "one of the first films of 1999 is this mtv pictures release which marks the first leading feature role for james van der beek , the star of the wb's runaway hit dawson's creek . \nfollowing in the foot steps of mtv's two other live action films , joe's apartment ( 1996 ) and dead man on campus ( 1998 ) , varsity blues is a bad film and is unlikely to cause much of a sensation in the marketplace . \nset in west cannan , texas , the film examines the small town obsession with high school football through the eyes of second string quarterback john \" mox \" moxon ( van der beek ) . \nwe know he's smart because he reads kurt vonnegut instead of the playbook . \ncoach bud kilmer ( jon voight ) has been around so long there is actually a bronze statue commemorating him . \nthe star quarterback , lance harbor ( paul walker ) , is a handsome , blonde , hero who has his own billboard in his front yard and dates the sexy head cheerleader , darcy ( ali larter ) . \nalso on the team are an enormous guy ( ron lester ) with some health problems and the token african-american team member ( eliel swinton ) whose only real dialogue scene deals directly with the color of his skin . \nwhen lance is seriously injured , mox gets his chance to shine and he runs with it , undermining kilmer with his unusual playing strategies . \nhis relationship with his dutiful girlfriend , jules ( amy smart ) , is threatened and there's a big game at the end . \nguess who wins ? \nnothing about varsity blues is inspired and the whole film simply moves through the sort of conventional motions that coach kilmer would love . \nthere's a chance for some smart satire on small town obsessions but the humor here is decidedly lowbrow . \nvan der beek does a decent job of carrying his first film although a silly accent trips him up sometimes . \nalso , the role isn't very much of a stretch from his dawson leary character . \nhe's still a pseudo-intellectual , whiny , nice guy , except here he also happens to be a jock . \nvoight is a terror as he chews up every single piece of scenery and spits it out . \nthe other adults are all notably awful while the younger performers don't fare much better . \non the positive side , walker is a charismatic actor who is due for a breakout role following this and his supporting turn in pleasantville ( 1998 ) . \nscott ( son of james ) caan has some lively moments as tweeder , the team's wild man . \nlarter , as a gorgeous seductress looking for a one way ticket out of texas , gets to show off the film's most interesting costumes , including a very eye-opening \" whipped cream bikini . \" \nit's interesting to note that the film definitely earns its r-rating with a lot of harsh language , alcohol abuse and an unusually high amount of nudity ( including a gratuitous trip to a strip bar that reveals a not very surprising surprise ) . \nall this is likely to come as a shock to the young female fan base of dawson's creek , presumably the target audience for the picture . \ndirector brian robbins previously helmed the kids feature good burger ( from nickelodeon films , a sister company of mtv ) and changes directions here a bit but still fails to make much of an impression . \nthe look of the movie is as bland as the town and characters who populate it . \nthe football scenes are generally unexciting and the entire film looks a bit washed out . \nthere's an ok soundtrack featuring music from collective soul , foo fighters , green day and aaliyah but it's not as impressive as one would expect from a mtv film . \n", "susan granger's review of \" america's sweethearts \" ( columbia/sony ) \nwhat a waste of a talented cast ! \nbilly crystal and co-writer peter tolan have concocted a sly , provocative premise and , as the opening credits roll , it's obvious that they're attempting an old-fashioned romantic comedy . \nthe story involves a veteran publicist ( billy crystal ) who is summoned to orchestrate a press junket in las vegas when an arrogant director ( christopher walken ) holds a megabuck movie hostage in his editing room , refusing to show it to anyone . \nhe figures that by giving the journalists juicy hints of a possible reconciliation between the film's once-married-but-now-estranged stars , gwen and eddie ( catherine zeta-jones , john cusack ) , they'll be so distracted that they won't remember they didn't see the movie or it wasn't what they expected . \n ( and crystal thought of this long before a sony exec concocted the phony critic/david manning quote scandal ! ) \nfor help , he turns to gwen's personal assistant/sister ( julia roberts ) . \nbut the laughs are few and far-between . \ncrystal's glib , cynical flack isn't wickedly funny enough with a few amusing one-liners . \nafter six months under the care of a depak chopra-like guru ( alan arkin ) , cusack's character's too emotionally fragile , lacking the necessary charisma . \nzeta-jones's vain , narcissistic diva is undeveloped and one-dimensional . \nonly hank azaria , as zeta-jones's much-macho spanish lover , and stanley tucci , as a studio exec , and roberts manage to whip up any farcical froth . \nbasically , we don't like these ego-driven , stereotypical characters , let alone root for them to unwind their romantic entanglements , and joe roth's direction is predictable , formulaic and telegraphic . \non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" america's sweethearts \" is a contrived , shallow 4 . as a screwball satire , it's strictly superficial . \n", "susan granger's review of \" jeepers creepers \" ( mgm/ua entertainment ) \nthis nasty , little horror film begins as a bickering brother ( justin long ) and sister ( gina philips ) are driving through the desolate countryside on their way home from college and spy a man dropping wrapped-up bodies down a drainage pipe . \nwhen long decides to investigate , there's nothing but trouble . \n \" you know the part in scary movies where somebody does something really stupid and everybody hates them for it ? \n- well , this is it ! \" \nphilips warns . \nwhat he finds in the basement of an old , abandoned church is a dying boy with a horrifying , jagged-stitched incision from his neck to his navel , plus hundreds of other mutilated bodies , stitched together on the walls and ceiling like a disgusting tapestry . \nlong flees but now the monstrous , winged creeper ( jonathan breck ) is after both of them ! \neileen brennan appears briefly as the cat lady and patricia belcher is jezelle , a psychic who explains the evil creature's bizarre feeding habits . \non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" jeepers creepers \" is a fiendishly visceral 2 with an extraordinarily gruesome conclusion , giving new meaning to the old song \" jeepers creepers . \" \nand now - as paul harvey would say - for the rest of the story . \nwhat's more scary than the cruelty of the satanic film itself is the fact that writer/director victor salva is a convicted child molester who videotaped himself having oral sex with a 12 year-old actor in california . \nsentenced to three years in prison , he served 15 months and completed parole in 1992 . \nwhen salva made \" powder \" ( 1995 ) , the story of an albino boy with supernatural abilities , disney studio executives claimed that they did not know about his prior conviction as a pedophile . \nand now , once again , in this mgm/ua film , that fact is conspicuously absent from his press kit bio . \n", "this independent film written and directed by eric bross has the look and feel of all those other troubled blue-collar youth films that have inundated the market in recent times . \nit is hard to tell what is independent about this film ; it might as well have been made in hollywood or on a home videocam . \nit is the debut film for the director , who tells his personal story about italians growing up with heavy new jersey accents and remaining tight with each other as they grow into young adults , a tale which could have been rewarding to see in the 1950s , where the mind-set of all the characters depicted is grounded , but to see it in the 1990s is a different story : it is old news . \nthe love story between the simple girl waiting to get married and her luckless boyfriend turning nasty on her doesn't mean much , since their relationship remained undeveloped . \nthe introduction of the wise-guy angle and the loyality among buddies bit , are not moving enough emotional experiences or intelligent enough dramatics to elevate this film above its limited story line despite the tour-de-force performance by the star of the film , adrien brody as ray . \nray is the only son of a low-level mobster once arrested for running an illegal casino operation out of his bloomfield , new jersey , suburban basement . \nray sr . ( vincent ) is now trying to make a go of it by running a small scale home-repair business . \nhis son lives with him and works unhappily as a shoe salesman , dreaming of getting rich quickly so he can open a business and marry his long-time waitress girlfriend joanne ( sybil ) . \nthe title of this film refers to the shoe size of paul newman-10b , which really has nothing to do with explaining anything about the film . you \nshould be aware that there are a lot of things about this film that don't make sense : its constant brainless chatter between the buddies , their uneventful growing pains , and the despair of their lives , make it very difficult to feel any empathy for them . \ndesperate to make his dream come through , ray goes to a loanshark , humorously and menacingly played by james e . moriarty , and borrows 10 grand to bet on a \" sure thing \" at freehold raceway . \nthe horse loses and now ray has big problems , as the loanshark comes after him with his muscle to get his dough . \nthere is nothing i have seen so far to like about ray . \nhe is undependable , mean-spirited , and stupid . \nso when his best friend mike ( gallagher ) , the narrator of the film , gets a chance to sleep with his girlfriend--who cares ? \nthe director must be kidding himself if he thinks we do . \nas for ray's gambling debt and his dilemma of how to pay it off , the story is too predictable for anything other than what you would expect to happen . \nhis buddies , the college student mike and the dependable butchie ( gillan ) , and his old man , who he has this love/hate relationship with , rally to his aid . \nand the film ends on an obligatory artistic note of ambiguity , that seems to be the way it is for all those wannabe artistic films , as ray is off to florida all by his lonesome self to try to put his life together . \nthere was just no energy or spark or anything relevant in this superficial film to keep it interesting , though adrien brody showed signs that he could be a future star . \nbecause of his intensity and looks , he reminds me of sean penn . \n", "come on hollywood , surprise me . \nstop giving us these poorly written thrillers with banal dialogue , sketchy characters and plots as predictable as the sunset . \nthe always watchable morgan freeman plays a detective who becomes personally involved in a case involving missing girls . \npersonal , because his niece is one of the victims . \nit's a slobbering psychopath , of course , but this time there's a twist . \nfreeman notes that each of the young women who've disappeared are all strong willed , assertive , and more successful in their careers than the average girl . \nwe soon learn that the guy calls himself casanova , whose aim is to \" dominate \" these modern gals by imprisoning them in some dungeon and keeping them as his personal harem . \nanyway , one of the women manages to escape ( ashly judd ) and teams up with freeman to . . . well , \nyou know the rest . \na brief glance at the plot to silence of the lambs , with which this film is constantly being compared to by the hype merchants , may suggest lambs also has a fairly predictable story . \nperhaps , but that film also has superbly drawn characters and smart dialogue . \nso lets not insult a great movie by taking the comparisons any further , okay ? \nand as for comparisons to seven . . . oh \nplease ! \nkiss the girls is based on the novel by james patterson and written for the screen by one david klass . \nmaybe the novel was a stinker to start with , but whatever the case , it's the writing that's clearly at fault here . \none , these characters have very little to say that's engaging or interesting . \ntwo , the script has no sense of humour . \nthree , while the notion of a psycho's victims being smart , successful women is an interesting twist , the execution isn't even half as good as the idea . \nthus , ashly judd comes across all out of focus , instead of being the heart of the story . \nwe can't feel her rage . \nsome atrociously written casual exchanges between her and several male characters are supposed to remind us that she's the no-bullshit 90's type , but these conversations barely register . \nand as for freeman , kiss the girls is his second dog in a year : first chain reaction , now this . \nfor an actor of his calibre , this is most worrying . \nyoung director gary fleder scored a hit a few years back with his quirky pulp fiction-esque things to do in denver when your dead . \nbut what can he do with material as resolutely mediocre as this ? \nnot much , and you can hardly blame him . \nthere's a few well-staged chase scenes through the forest where the camera whirls , dives and jumps , and the effect is startling . \nbut the script is beyond rescue . \nwhat hurts most is that hollywood continues to get away with serving up this tripe , safe in the knowledge that jaded audiences will lap it up . \ncomplacency rules : it's been so long since we saw a mainstream american thriller that delivered juicy characters , real surprises and consistently sharp dialogue . \nthe only consolation for this viewer is that my ticket to the movie was a freebie , positive proof that the best things in life aren't free . . . . \n . \n", "capsule : the much anticipated re-adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting , but very little intelligence . \nvisually there is much to like about this version , but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver's travels and treat it as an action film . \nthat makes it a film without much center . \n , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) \npierre boulle , author of the bridge on the river kwai , wrote planet of the apes ( a . k . a . monkey planet ) , the novel , as a social satire . \nit reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver's travels . \nhumans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed , not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift's island of the houyhnhnms . \nthe novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet . \nit seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals , but perhaps i was just looking for that . \nwhen rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 , he added a number of serling touches , familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling-ish . \nthe final irony of the original version has become film history . \nwithout it there could never have been a \" planet of the apes \" film series . \ni can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language . \nin the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language . \nthat could have been done in the film , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking . \nserling avoided this by having the apes speak english and , of course , there is some justification for that by the end of the film . \njustifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending . \nbut serling never tackles the all-important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear . \nfew viewers questioned this serious plot hole , however , and the film has become well respected in cinema history . \npartial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith's best if not his best . \nwhen the film's success called for sequels , the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well-intentioned , though not very subtle , political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s . \nwhile the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half- hearted , by the second film , beneath the planet of the apes , there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases . \nthe series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973 . \nnow director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again . \nfor those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book , burton's new version is even less faithful . \nfirst , he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes . \nhe has them both be intelligent , articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands , uh , make that paws , of the apes . \nthat could be a good story too , but it is not planet of the apes . \nas with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century , the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring . \nin 2029 leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , not this world's most expressive actor ) works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes . \nthen a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard-of-oz-fashion and drops him on an alien planet . \n ( yes , he survives this storm , but then no storm is perfect . ) \nhe quickly finds , not greatly to any surprise he shows , that on this planet apes rule and humans drool , but everybody talks . \nand the language they talk is earth- english . \napparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that . \nthe fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn't occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film . \nboth just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english . \nin any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human-animal relationships and more one of the master-slave relationships . \noutside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic . \nleo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari , played by helena bonham carter . \nari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power . \nshe is bent on making the world a better place . \nperhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil-ari . \nin any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout , carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film . \nshe may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward . \nit is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes . \nthis is a further abandonment of the source material . \nthe chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each's place in this reversed society , each important in the book . \nwe cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down . \nwe see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them . \nburton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn . \nthis is a miscalculation , as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in . \nthey are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win . \nthe 1968 script had little subtlety , with lines like \" i never met an ape i didn't like , \" but at least we cared for what happened to taylor , the main character . \nmost of what this film has to offer is in the visuals . \nthe visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog . \nthis tends to limit close looks at the makeup . \nin general it seems much improved from 1968 . \nthe makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers , who did it for the 1968 version . \nin 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw-dropper . \nit was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion . \nchambers is good , but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker . \ntoday audiences have higher expectations ; baker's visualization is really an improvement . \nthese visuals work nicely . \nwhat does not work is the wire- assisted leaps some of the apes make . \nthey look like they were inspired by the physics- defying leaps of crouching tiger , hidden dragon . \napes spring incredible distances . \nsome of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture , but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost . \none final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close-up . \nsince the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make-up . \nthe one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti . \nit is not that his lines are so good , most are silly jokes . \nbut he delivers them very well . \nhe was always a watchable actor , but has not yet made stardom . \nas the ape-trader limbo he over-emotes to overcome his ape make-up , but does it very well . \nin doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen . \nhe is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov's performance in spartacus . \nas an in-joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself . \ndanny elfman's score has a nice primitive feel , but jerry goldsmith's 1968 tour de force score is a real classic . \nthat score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten . \ni rate the remake 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n", "i wish i could accurately describe the theme music for part 3 . \nthe best way i can put it is that it's funky . \ni know this is an odd question , but remember the opening music of \" police academy 4 : citizens on patrol \" , when steve guttenberg and michael winslow perform the title song \" citizens on patrol \" during the opening credits ? \nit's just like that . \nanyway , part 3 takes place a day after the events of part 2 ( so technically still 1985 ) . \nthis time , a group of horny teens ( who also bring along two aging hippie potheads for some reason ) head up to a cabin on crystal lake for a weekend of sex and weed . \nit turns out that one of the teens had been attacked by jason earlier in her life ( which must have been between parts 1 and 2 ) so why she has returned to crystal lake one day after a new batch of murders is beyond me . \nshe's the lone survivor this time . \npart 3 was originally shown in theaters in 3-d , and from what i can tell from the video , it looks as though they may have been fairly decent effects . \njason had long , wild hair when he was unmasked in part 2 . now , one day later he's completely bald . \nalso , it being one day later , it can't be friday the 13th now can it ? \noh well . \nsteve miner is the only director who helmed more than one film in the series . \n[r] \n", "jessica lange is one of the most inconsistent actresses working today . \nfrom time-to-time , she blows away audiences with powerful , intense performances . \non the other hand , this is the same woman who made her jaw-droppingly awful feature debut in dino delaurentiis' king kong . \nand , much as lange would probably prefer movie-goers to develop amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume , every once in a while she does work that is reminiscent of it , if only in quality . \nhush is one such example . \nlange is so bad here that she might have been fun to watch if the rest of the film wasn't such a prime example of motion picture tedium . \nthe film opens , as many so-called \" psychological thrillers \" do , by posing as a light drama . \nwe are introduced to jackson ( johnathon schaech , last encounter in tom hanks' that thing you do ! ) and helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) , a picture perfect young couple who are very much in love . \njackson is taking helen home for the holidays so she can meet his mother , martha ( lange ) . \nthe moment i first saw martha , i started looking for fangs . \nsoon , the wicked witch of the east is plotting a way for her son to get helen pregnant ( this involves poking a hole in a diaphragm ) . \nonce that goal is accomplished , she manipulates events so that the expecting couple moves out of new york city to the horse farm where she lives . \nas long as she gets her way , martha is a perfectly amicable person , but when helen defies her , it's a declaration of war . \nhush has three very simple problems : it's incredibly dumb , it's incredibly boring , and it's incredibly predictable ( at least up to the stupefying ending ) . \nthis film has absolutely nothing to recommend it , with the exception of a couple of nice shots of snow-covered fields and a quick glimpse of gwyneth paltrow's bare buttocks . \nfrankly , it's embarrassing to watch a respected actress of lange's stature give a performance like this -- it's like a bad blanche dubois ( the role she played in a 1995 tv version of a streetcar named desire ) . \nmeanwhile , paltrow does her best to get through her dialogue without gaping at the stupidity of some of her lines , and schaech attempts a passable imitation of an inanimate object . \nas in all psychological thrillers , the battle lines are clearly drawn . \nhere , it's mom and against wife , with jackson caught in the middle . \nof course , since schaech's character is poorly-developed and badly acted , it's impossible to say how he feels about being in that situation . \nmaybe someone should ask him if he's familiar with oedipus . \nmartha is , of course , the evil one . \nhow do we know she's evil ? \nshe smokes cigarettes and drinks hard liquor -- two sure signs that the devil is at work . \non the other hand , helen is a good girl . \nthe evidence for this is that she's nice to old ladies and treasures a locket with a picture of her dead parents . \nthat's about it for character development . \nbeyond that point , hush is just a series of increasingly hard-to-swallow coincidences , contrivances , and moronic plot twists . \nhowever , the first 85 minutes are just a warm-up for the ending , which is as anticlimactic as it is profoundly dissatisfying . \ni can't imagine anyone , no matter what they thought of the movie as a whole , liking this conclusion . \neither there was some serious last-minute editing or someone left out a few pages of the script . \nbefore the climax , i disliked hush ; by the time the end credits started , i hated it . \nviewers invest something in every movie they watch , no matter how good or bad it is . \ncheating them like this is offensive and unpardonable . \nmost entries into this worn-out , worm-eaten genre aren't especially good . \nfilms like consenting adults , the hand that rocks the cradle , and single white female rely on stock plots and predictable twists to propel the narrative along . \nin general , however , they're directed with a degree of competence that assures a level of sustained tension . \nthat's not the case with really bad thrillers like this , which fail to generate even a momentary heart palpitation -- the characters are too bland and the plot is too uninvolving for anyone in the audience to care . \nindeed , the title of this movie probably refers to what the producers hope viewers will do in lieu of telling their friends what they really think of this sorry piece of celluloid . \n", "synopsis : sonny koufax ( adam sandler ) is a rich , childish , angry man who has just been dumped by his girlfriend vanessa ( kristy swanson ) . \nin a bid to impress vanessa sonny impersonates his friend kevin ( jon stewart ) and adopts a 5 year old boy named julian ( cole and dylan sprouse ) while kevin is on an overseas trip . \nunder sonny's supervision julian soon learns to lie to women , tell people how he \" wipes his ass , \" throw tantrums , and scream for his \" god damned \" treats . \nself centered , julian breaks a school classmate's arm without apologizing or even realizing he has done anything wrong . \nmeanwhile sonny bribes julian with sugary talk , food , toys , and flashy promises in order to get the kid to perform . \nnot surprisingly the government takes julian away from sonny's incompetent supervision , and this leads to a custody battle . \nopinion : it's a movie about an embittered creep teaching a little kid to be a jerk , and we all get cheap laughs because for 90 minutes the innocent kindergartner never finds out what it means when he mimics all the bad boy behavior . \nthat's the essence of big daddy . \nbut there's a bigger issue involved : marketing . \nmovies that are rated pg and pg-13 are heavily marketed towards children of preteen age and below . \non tv , film clips advertise these movies as family-friendly hit comedies . \nthen when you go see them they turn out to be either raunchy sex acts like austin powers with characters named fat bastard - - or big daddy where adult characters get their jollies by buddying up to naive five year olds and encouraging them to experiment with drugs and mistreatment . \nfolks in hollywood are trying to develop a preteen market for raunchy stuff , but i think most american parents would agree that early childhood is a time of mental innocence that should be protected from uncaring media market exploitation . \nto many american mothers there's probably nothing more pathetic and unsettling than the sight of a theater full of unsupervised little eight year olds laughing raucously as movie character father adam sandler jokes about a woman's \" ice cold tits . \" \n", "certainly no one would rent ed wood's glen or glenda ? \nexpecting to see a good movie , but this screwy discourse about transvestitism betrays a level of incompetence that i didn't know was possible . \nin fact , wood's infamous plan 9 from outer space actually seems pretty tame by comparison . \nwatching glen or glenda ? \ni found myself occasionally wondering if wood had originally made two or three separate movies and accidentally edited them together ; as a result , it is actually quite entertaining in that it is unintentionally hilarious . \nthe movie starts out as what mostly seems like a bad documentary , with endless , repetitive narration about transvestites , how difficult it is for a transvestite to look at his girlfriend's clothes without being able to wear them , how transvestites are not necessarily homosexuals , and how the main character , glen/glenda is ( as it reminds us probably half a dozen times ) \" not half man and half woman , but man and woman at the same time . \" \nthe camera work is terrible-occasionally the camera lingers on , say , a closed door while the characters talk off-screen , or inexplicably zooms in on someone's ear or nose . \nwood also makes copious use of mostly irrelevant stock footage , which leads to voiced-over non-sequiturs like , \" yes , our world is a busy and frightening place , with so many people driving their automobiles . \" \nfinally , there is occasional commentary from bela lugosi as a sort of omniscient being who seems to inhabit a frankenstein-style laboratory , delivering pointless lines such as , \" people . \n . \n . \nall with their own thoughts . \n . \n . \ntheir own ideas . \n . \n . \n . \" \nwhile lightning crackles quasi-ominously overhead . \nhad wood continued in this vein , glen or glenda ? \nprobably would have been remembered as nothing more than a poorly done documentary with the occasional inappropriate horror-movie touch . \nunfortunately , he then wanders so far off into left field that you have to wonder if he had been eating some funny mushrooms when he wrote the script . \n \" pull the string ! \npull the string ! \" \nannounces an alarmed lugosi as stock footage of buffalo appears . \nthere is another crash of lightning before lugosi returns , this time warning us , \" beware . \n . \n . \nbeware the big green dragon that lurks outside your door ! \n . \n . \n . \nit eats little boys . \n . \n . \nand puppy dogs' tails . \n . \n . \nand big fat snails ! \" \na bizarre nightmare sequence , which is probably meant to be symbolic but instead is just incredibly stupid , ensues , during which glen/glenda finds his fiance trapped under a fallen tree-in the living room . \nsomeone who is apparently intended to be the sinister \" green dragon \" ( but looks more like a klingon from the original star trek series ) appears to be orchestrating all this , though the film is far from clear on this point ( to put it kindly ) . \nnear the end of this scene-and here i must confess that wood lost me completely-is a violent sexual encounter on a couch that features two characters who do not even appear in the rest of the movie and is scored by goofily upbeat folk music . \nafter this scene ends ( not a moment too soon ) , glen or glenda ? \nreturns to its documentary style , but at that point any lingering sense that wood had the slightest idea what he was doing is pretty much gone . \nthe film wanders to a dumb happy ending that also seems to abandon much of what it was trying to say about transvestitism , but at that point it didn't matter much what happened . \nas soon as the aforementioned sex scene was over , glen or glenda ? \nhad pretty much cemented its place in my mind as the most incoherent film i had ever seen . \ni honestly think that if i picked up my camcorder and deliberately tried to make the worst movie i possibly could , it still might not match glen or glenda ? \nfor sheer cinematic disaster . \ni am giving this movie an f , but i'm not sure that quite does it justice . \n", "the second serial-killer thriller of the month is just awful . \noh , it starts deceptively okay , with a handful of intriguing characters and some solid location work . \nafter a baby-sitter gets gutted in the suit- ably spooky someone's-in-the-house prologue , parallel stories unfold , the first involving a texas sheriff ( r . lee emery ) , a gruesome double murder , and the arrival of a morose fbi agent ( dennis quaid ) on the eve of voting for the local lawman's reelection . \nthe second pairs a hitch- hiker ( jared leto ) with a friendly former railroad worker ( danny glover ) . \nthey're headed west , toward the rockies and away from the murder scene . \nwhich one is the killer ? \nwell , it doesn't really matter , 'cause when writer/first-time director jeb stuart ( die hard ) finally spills the beans , you won't take his choice seriously anyway . \nthe whole thing goes south about an hour in , with the tale taking hairpin turns that i certainly couldn't follow . \nand through the whole thing there's quaid , playing with the most intense monotony this side of steven sea- gal . \ni guess i'm glad that i didn't walk out-- there's some nice train stuff at the end and a fun nod to dr . \nstrangelove . \n", "this is my first review that i post to this newsgroup , and i kind of feel like i have to say something negative about this film . \nno one else seems to care that it takes certain liberties that should not be taken with a historical story . \nhowever , even if one thinks of it as fiction , \" the prince of egypt \" remains shallow . \nbut i'll begin from the beginning . \nthe biggest difference between the original , biblical story and this version is that moses has some semblance of divinity in the bible , whereas the animated version gives the impression of a reluctant hero . \nmaybe it's just me , but if i knew i had god on my side , i'd have a little bit more confidence . \nthere are other differences as well , such as a lack of important female characters and the passing over of the original pharoah's death like it's nothing but a thing . \nmost of all , though , the story's focus has shifted . \nrather than being a story about father-son , man-ethnicity , man-god , \" the prince of egypt \" is almost solely about the brother-brother relationship between rameses and moses . \ni was originally excited about this story element until i saw the movie , where it came off as maudlin . \nrameses and moses squabble like children and then , in the interests of peace , moses saves rameses' butt , even though moses was the one who started it . . . \n * yawn * i didn't care anymore by the time moses ran off for murdering an overseer ( which , of course , never happened in the original story - moses was exiled ) . \nbut enough about the differences . \nlet's talk about the movie itself . \nit features a moses who , in the interests of making the character more human , lacks any divinity whatsoever , which isn't convincing at all to anyone who knows who god is . \nit features a cookie-cutter \" i-wanna-please-dada \" rameses , who at least is given dignity by the voicework of ralph fiennes ( from schindler's list , among other things ) . \nthe film also features an extremely annoying character by way of the \" new-improved \" miriam , voiced by the ever-antsy sandra bullock , even though the most irritating thing about her is her tendency to burst into song for no apparent reason ( here bullock is replaced by a singing voice ) . \nspeaking of which , it contains * very * annoying music . \nit contains shallow writing . \nit features extraordinary animation , which is one good thing i can say about this film . \nmost of all , it contains an attempt to commercialize , homogenize , and mass-market a story about a manifestation of god . \ni am not christian , but i got the impression of blasphemy . \nthe writers and producers took a butcher knife and chop-chopped into the story . \n", "for \" original sin , \" the road to the screen has been rocky . \ninitially slated for release last november , the film was bumped twice , finally landing in the dog days of summer 2001 . \nadvance screenings of the film were denied to all but a few critics , generally a sign that the studio realizes it has a dud on its hands . \nso is \" original sin \" really all that bad ? \nyes it is , but the melodrama does offer some rewards . \nthe location settings are gorgeous and there is a healthy sprinkling of t&a ( with angelina jolie providing the \" t \" and antonio banderas the \" a \" ) . \nmore importantly , the movie is entertainingly bad . \nveteran readers know that , as a rule , i don't encourage people to patronize lousy films . \nmost of the time , there are plenty of quality offerings on the marketplace that are more deserving of our money and besides , the \" let's go laugh at the failings of others \" mindset reflects an elitism that makes me uncomfortable . \nbut things are different this summer . \nquality films , to put it mildly , have been few and far between , so as far as i'm concerned , it's fair to find our kicks where we may . \n \" original sin \" will never join such treasures as \" valley of the dolls , \" \" road house \" and \" showgirls \" in the bad movie hall of fame , but it'll do until something worse comes along . \nthe film , adapted by director michael cristofer from the cornell woolrich novel , \" waltz into darkness \" ( which was also the source for the 1969 francois truffaut film , \" mississippi mermaid \" ) , opens in a turn-of-the-century prison , as jolie's character , slated for a dawn execution , tells her lurid tale to a priest who appears desperately horny . \nthe freshman writing class tone is quickly established when she says things like , \" this is not a love story , it is a story about love . \" \nwary of local gold-diggers , cuban coffee dealer luis antonio vargas ( banderas ) makes arrangements to secure a mail order bride from america , listing himself as a mere clerk to dissuade foreign gold-diggers . \na practical man , luis chooses a frumpy looking lady , hoping she will be a loyal mate able to provide him with children . \nimagine his surprise when his fianc ? e , julia russell ( jolie ) , turns out to be infinitely more attractive than the woman in the photo . \njulia explains that she sent a different woman's image because she didn't want to be selected solely for her pretty face . \nluis then confesses his deception , leading julie to state , with great significance , \" we have something in common , we are both not to trusted . \" \nafter their wedding , luis and julia retire for a glorious night of carefully choreographed lovemaking , with their bodies positioned to display her breasts and his bottom as erotically as possible . \njolie and banderas are attractive people and watching them naked is fun , although the filmmakers' insistence on using one of banderas' legs to cover jolie's crotch makes it look like he's trying to climb her . \nluis , the stupidest man who ever lived , immediately instructs the bank to make his personal and business accounts available to julia , despite the fact that she seems nothing like the woman with whom he corresponded . \nhis blissful ignorance continues as the warning signs mount up . \nluis must force julia to write to her sister emily , who is frantic over her lack of communication . \nshortly after julia complains about the chirping of a pet bird , it is found on the floor of its cage with a broken neck . \nfinally , when she cleans out his accounts and disappears , luis begins to suspect that something might be wrong . \nincidentally , if you're afraid i'm giving too much away , rest assured that all of this happens in the first 30 minutes of the movie , leaving plenty of time for numerous dopey plot twists , a great deal of operatic acting and more footage of her tits and his ass . \nalong the way , private detective walter downs ( played by thomas jane , who was terrific as mickey mantle in the hbo movie \" 61 * \" ) turns up , hired by the frumpy woman's sister to find out what happened to the real julia . \nluis is also eager for the detective to track down the con artist , having decided that if he can't have her , he will kill her . \noh , the pathos of it all . \nthe cast appears to recognize the trashiness of the story , adjusting their performances accordingly . \nbanderas is suitably impassioned , while jolie alternates between vamping and pouting ( and with those lips , she can really pout ) . \nas for thomas jane , he starts off acting suspicious and cagey , then accelerates to a snidely whiplash level of nastiness . \nhis most startling moment comes when , to prove his power to humiliate , he forces luis against a wall , verbally taunts him while rubbing his cheeks against those of luis and then finishes establishing his dominance with a full-on kiss . \nif anyone ever questions the difference between sex and rape , show them this chilling scene . \nand if anyone ever questions the difference between real drama and a laughable potboiler , show them \" original sin . \" \n", "one would think that david duchovny , star of

operator is desperately in need of help . \non the run from russian mobsters ( the bad guys that seem to be all the rage in this year's films ) and trying to cut a pirate software deal with the chinese mafia , blossom is surrounded by blood . \nafter a few medical misadventures , the physician grows disenchanted with his employment . \nan encounter with a couple of psycho surfer dudes who threaten to blow him away unless he \" fixes \" their dead buddy cements his feeling that he is in the wrong line of work . \nwhen the fbi visits and forces him to become an informant , there is no question that he needs to be somewhere else . \noddly enough , these seem like they could be exciting scenes . \nthe film disproves that assumption . \nthen a bunch of other uninteresting things happen . \nwriting this only two days after seeing the film , its a struggle to remember the events . \nyou can take that as a solid lack of recommendation . \nfor all the coolness that duchovny exhibits in \" x-files \" , it's a surprise that his big screen presence is so lacking in charisma . \nthe doctor is particularly bland and dull . \neven the cold turkey bit which is rife with dramatic possibilities come across as banal . \na little chocolate and minor sweats get him through heroin withdrawal . \nlike virtually everything else in the film , it's a missed opportunity . \nthe fox mulder detachment doesn't work here . \noscar-winner hutton's manic mobster is much more difficult to get a handle on . \nplayed partially for comedy and partially as crazed killer , blossom almost becomes real , but then sinks into goofiness . \nmost of the time hutton looks as if he's searching for his character and coming up empty . \njolie also makes a few false moves towards creating a three-dimensional human being before giving up and turning into scenery . \nthe most interesting aspect of her performance is watching her pouty lips threaten to take over the screen . \nthe rest aren't any better . \nmichael massee's eccentric fbi agent never revs up . \none of blossom's henchmen steals a few moments of the show as a quirky gunman reminiscent of val kilmer's doc holliday in \" tombstone \" . \nhis two-gunned blasting as he does a bizarre dance is the high point of the film . \nbut that 15 seconds isn't worth sitting through the other 90 minutes . \nfirst time film director andy wilson ( known for his work on the british television series \" cracker \" ) appears to be attempting to jump on the \" pulp fiction \" bandwagon . \nthe best of these movies combine a

, and fails even as the most rudimentary entertainment . \nnow before i start getting e-mails angrily touting the genius of jet li , let me explain myself . \nli is as spectacular as ever here , and i don't think anyone would ever dare call his martial-arts-star skills into question . \nthe problem isn't with him , it's with the movie's tone . \nthe much touted fight-scenes here are filmed with such unflinching , unrelenting brutality that they are unpleasant to watch . \nthey're joyless , perfuctory ; li's rogue chinese detective is more of a killing machine than a hero , a terminator with a black belt instead of a metal skeleton . \nbut even the terminator in judgement day had a sympathetic side . \nthe plot isn't relevant , but if you're curious , it's some nonsense about a chinese law enforcement officer ( li ) sent to paris to investigate a possible drug ring and encounter a corrupt chief of police ( tcheky karyo ) , who kills people and does sinister things with no motivation whatsoever . \noh yeah , and li's character is also an acupuncture expert who is able to ease pain and/or kill at the touch of a needle . \n \" kiss of the dragon \" is the name of an acupuncture maneuver , in which you stick a needle in a precise location on the back of the victim's neck , somehow redirecting all of the body's bloodflow to the brain and killing the poor sap more or less immediately . \nthere's a vague attempt to humanize li by having him fall in love with a downtrodden prostitute , whose daughter is being held hostage , for some reason , by the villain . \nthis is one of the worst love stories i have ever seen on screen , even worse than the one in pearl harbor . \nthere's no conviction whatsoever as the movie barely pays lip service to it ; it's only here because someone apparently thought there should be some kind of boy-meets-girl subplot . \nkiss of the dragon was written by luc besson , whose screenplay the messenger : the story of joan of arc , for all of that film's flaws , was at least thoughtful . \ni don't know why the guy got himself involved in this train wreck , but perhaps he wanted to so something more mainstream after the neverending weirdness of the fifth element and the aforementioned stylized biopic . \ni suppose you could call this mainstream , but i'll choose the bizarre any time of the day . \nif action scenes in a movie are going to be brutal instead of dazzling , you need a story to justify watching them . \nthe filmmakers behind kiss of the dragon should have rethought their strategy . \nno one will walk out of this misbegotten project smiling , but i hear rush hour 2 is coming in just a few weeks . \n", "the rich legacy of cinema has left us with certain indelible images . \nthe tinkling christmas

troopers \" director paul verhoeven adds one more image that will live in our memories forever : doogie houser doing a vulcan mind meld with a giant slug . \n \" starship troopers , \" loosely based on the robert heinlein novel , is the story of an interstellar war between humans and giant insects . \nin the hands of verhoeven , the mammoth sci-fi battle flick is one of the most astonishingly bad films ever made , a monument to inept filmmaking on a colossal scale . \nto put it simply , it's a bug bomb . \nin \" robocop \" and \" total recall , \" verhoeven displayed a gift for creating an entertaining mix of violence , special effects and social satire , and \" starship troopers \" starts off in similar fashion , with a tongue-in-cheek futuristic military recruitment ad that shows promise . \nthings go downhill fast , though , as we meet our heroes , a group of buenos aires teens preparing to graduate from high school . \ninexplicably , johnny rico , carmen ibenez , dizzy flores and xander barcalow are played by square-jawed anglo kids who look like they just stepped out of a mountain dew commercial . \nit's a veritable \" alpha centuri 90210 \" as we watch the love-smitten teens squabble in the name of love . \nmichael ironside plays their teacher , who waves around a cheesy fake severed arm while lecturing about civic responsibilities . \neventually , the kids join the military , with dreams of glory in their addled little minds . \none of their classmates , carl jenkins ( \" doogie houser's \" neil patrick harris , ) snags a job in military intelligence because of his strong psychic abilities . \nhe displays his gift by psychically ordering a pet ferret to crawl up his mother's leg . \na long , dull boot camp sequence follows , enlivened only by an extended coed shower scene where the recruits swap snappy banter as the \" showgirls \" director's camera roams over their buff bodies . \nfinally , a full hour into the film , the war finally starts and we meet the enemy . \nthe bugs hail from klendathu and colonize planets by hurling their spores into space . \nthey attack starships by spinning around and firing deadly plasma blasts from their rears . \nyes , incredible as it seems , the bugs actually kill with cosmic farts . \na phenomenally large amount of money was spent creating the computer animated insects and the results are mixed at best . \nsweeping distant shots depicting hordes of giant bugs racing to attack are both impressive and scary , but the close-ups are a different matter . \nthe insects have an odd , artificial look , like origami creations with a mottled plastic coating . \nthe attack scenes are intensely violent , as one would expect from verhoeven , but the overall look is too phony to generate any real tension . \nwhile the action is frantic , the military strategy , wildly illogical even by hollywood standards , grows tiresome quickly . \nverhoeven tries to spice things up by throwing in more satiric news coverage , but the faux-jingoistic scenes of children \" doing their part for the war effort \" by squishing roaches on a sidewalk aren't enough to make up for the long stretches of sheer dreck . \none can only guess what paul verhoeven was trying to do here . \nhis customary one part satire , two parts ultra-violence formula is way out of whack , and most of the film just flounders . \nin \" showgirls \" fashion , some scenes are almost bad enough to be good . \nan intergalactic kegger party , with jake busey playing \" dixie \" on a green plexiglas fiddle , has a certain bizarre appeal . \na sex scene between two of the teens achieves a smarmy charm , enhanced a few minutes later when the female receives a fatal jab from a bug , but tells her hero that she doesn't mind dying . \n \" it's okay , \" she gasps , \" i got to have you ! \" \nand then , of course , there's doogie's mind meld with a bug . \nit's possible that verhoeven was attempting to create an homage to the era of the original novel . \nheinlein's pre- \" stranger in a strange land \" books were aimed at adolescent males , and \" starship troopers \" has the antiseptic retro-future look of late 50s/early 60s sci-fi . \nthe one cityscape shown is a jetsons-like gleaming metropolis , with flying cars whizzing past an obvious matte painting . \nthe hairstyles are retro too , straight from the frankie avalon , annette funicello school of fashion . \nultimately , verhoeven's motives are irrelevant . \nhe has produce a gargantuan film that fails as an action film or as a social satire . \nit even fails to be an entertaining bad movie . \navoid \" starship troopers \" at all costs . \n", "tim robbins and martin lawernce team up in this road movie comedy . \nrobbins

\nthere , lawernce attempts to steal his car , but to no avail , and is dragged along with robbin's on a trip to arizona . \nthere , they hold up a store , are mistaken for two other robbers ( just like in my cousin vinny ) and are chased by the police , and the other robbers . \nof course , there's gags along the way , usually from lawernce . \nalthough the film is midly funny , and quite watchable , there's something so horribly familiar about it all . \nthis film should really be called beverly hills midnight run there's lawernce with his wisecracking and heavy profanity , just like eddie murphy in beverly hills cop , and pratically the same idea as midnight run . \nit's full of all the road movie cliches , and even has a 'comedy' car chase , which just seemed so eighties . \neven the credit sequence seemed to be out of a steve martin , or chevy chase , eighties comedy . \nthere also isn't much chemistry between robbins and lawernce . \nin planes , trains and automobiles

, there is hardly any , \nthe director directs the film in a workman like fashion , but gets the jokes across . \nand although there is no chemistry between the two leads , they give good performances on their own . \nlawerence gives a good eddie murphy performance , and robbin's is alright aswell . \nhowever , robbin's performance is nowhere near as good as the characters he played in jacob's ladder , and the player . \nin fact , if you want to see robbin's do comedy much better than in nothing to lose , i suggest you rent out the hudsucker proxy , where he is much funnier . \nnothing to lose does have some funny moments in it , however . \nthe humour isn't particulary sophisticated , but if you enojyed dumb & dumber , you might enjoy this . \nthe characters in arizona are funny , and there's also a good scene where robbin's asks a shopkeeper which 'threatening approach' was better , lawerences ( which consisted of lawerence threatening to shoot the shopkeeper's ass , and swearing a lot ) , or himselfs , ( which was speaking in a deep , scary voice ) but the gags are predictable , the lack of chemistry infurating , and the ending too far-fetched and 'perfect' \nnothing to lose then , is robbin's first 'bad' movie ( and hopefully his last ) , and suggests that odereick should twice before making another film . \nhe nearly ruined carrey's career with ace ventura : when nature calls , let's hope he hasn't ruined robbin's ( or even lawerence's ) with nothing to lose . \n", "capsule : not as bad a sequel as crow 2 or batman & robin , but still horribly putrid , cheesy and

hood status in the hong kong action scene . \nnow , he has followed in the footsteps of director john woo , ( who launched chow's super stardom in the acclaimed 'a better tomorrow' ) by moving to hollywood . \ni had some reservations about this move and it would seem i was right to have them . \nchow plays a hitman who is doing jobs in order to repay a debt . \nhis final job requires him to kill a policeman's seven year old boy . \nthis he refuses do and runs . \nhowever , he is forced into a violent confrontation when his family are threatned and replacement killers are brought in to do the job . \ncue around 80 minutes of various and quite frankly tedious shoot- outs which take place in various locations . \nsome thought had gone into making them a bit different but unfortunately they end up being just plain boring . \nthe car wash scene , i found myself laughing at how stupid it looked . \ntut tut . \nthe emphasis during the constant action seemed to be on the accompanying music , ( i could have sworn one piece was ripped out of a bruckheimer movie ) and not on the content . \nmia sorvino ( a passport forger ) is dragged into the affay and also provides a lame love interest as well as being rather handy with a gun . \ndirector antoine arqua has clearly not observed chow's excellent acting capabilties and simply requires him to mutter a few lines of broken english and look flash as he stands and shoots . \nchow's trademark of twin pistol shooting is saved for the finale ( which in fairness is quite good ) and there's not even a toothpick in site . \nand as for making chow shoot like a cop , well that's damned unforgiveable . \nto round up , the replacement killers is a pretty darned lame first outing for chow . \nit would appear he has left asia for a 90 minute pop video . \nthis is not what we wanted at all , considering john woo was the exec producer . \n ( did he have no say so at all ? ) \nwatch 'the killer' again and weep at the difference .

sent . \nshe's convicted of his murder , of course , and leaves her son matty ( benjamin weir ) with her best friend ( annabeth gish ) . \ntime passes , and the friend disappears with matty . \nduring their last phone conversation libby hears matty yell \" daddy ! \" \nand realizes that her husband is still alive . \nlibby serves six years , growing harder and driven by the desire to kill nick ( based on the theory that because of the \" double jeopardy \" amendment she can off him with impunity ) . \nwhen she gets parole , she's sent to a halfway house run by travis lehman ( tommy lee jones ) , a former law professor who ruined his life with a drunk driving accident . \nafter a little breaking and entering and some destruction of property , libby jumps parole and lams it across the country looking for nick and matty . \ntravis pursues , naturally . \n \" double jeopardy \" is a watered-down version of \" the fugitive , \" with jones sleep-walking through his well-worn pursuer persona . \nalthough libby never leaps from a bus that collides with a train , she manages to get into a few nail-biters -- chased down the beach by a jeep , chained to a car that plunges into the ocean , sealed in a coffin -- that add some much needed thrills to an anemic , slow-moving script . \ncharacter development is thin . \ntravis' intriguing backstory is mentioned a couple times but has no effect on the story . \n ( i think they only made him a former law professor so that he could verify the double-jeopardy theory when libby gets the drop on nick . \nit's a long way to go for one line ) . \nthere's considerable sexual tension between travis and libby ( hey , there's something \" the fugitive \" didn't have ! ) , but it never goes anywhere . \nlibby is a tv-movie everywoman , but judd's intense performance draws us in and makes us forget that her character has no distinguishing characteristics . \nthis is judd's most prominent role to date , and she proves that she can light up the screen . \nlet's hope hollywood gives her more to work with next time around . \nthe quality of director bruce beresford's movies seems to depend on luck . \nwhen he has a good script and a strong cast , he turns out oscar-caliber work like \" 'breaker' morant , \" \" driving miss daisy , \" and \" tender mercies . \" \nwhen he doesn't . \n . \n . \nwe get \" double jeopardy . \"

believe i counted three . \n", "the swirling sick feeling hit me just a few minutes into \" heartbreakers . \" \nray liotta's character was making out with his secretary when his new wife knocked on the door of his office . \nwhile scrambling to collect himself , he frantically shouted to her , \" just wait a sex ? er , i mean sec ! \" \ni was struck by a wave of revulsion , thinking , \" geez , didn't lines like that die when 'three's company' was canceled ? \" \nover the next few minutes , as the barely double entendres and lingering cleavage shots grew more numerous , i realized that the mindset behind \" heartbreakers \" predated \" three's company . \" \nsuddenly , i had an out-of-body experience as my internal way-back machine swept me to the mid-1960s . \nall across america , the counter-culture was growing like wildfire , but there was scant evidence of it on tv . \nwhile young people were challenging traditional values on the streets , frustrated teenagers like me were stuck at home , sulking while our parents enjoyed the latest bob hope special . \nwomen in skimpy bathing suits would prance onscreen while hope made growling noises and leered at their breasts . \non another channel , dean martin made wisecracks about \" booze and broads \" and peter lawford , decked out in love beads and a nehru jacket , purred suggestive one-liners as he ogled the go-go dancers . \nthe adults laughed and laughed . \n \" heartbreakers \" reeks of that stagnant mentality , from its lingering shots of jennifer love hewitt's vah-vah-voom breasts to its leaden screenplay , which paints women as haughty schemers and men as drooling buffoons too sex-obsessed to realize they are being manipulated . \nin addition to liotta and hewitt , the cast includes sigourney weaver , gene hackman , jason lee , nora dunn and anne bancroft . \ni can't imagine what drew performers of their caliber to this project . \nperhaps they thought it was a parody of the sniggering sex comedies of the '60s . \nif so , they were sadly mistaken . \nthe story revolves around a mother-daughter con-team . \nit opens with the marriage of max ( weaver ) to dean ( liotta ) , a new jersey chop shop operator . \nhaving withheld sex until the honeymoon , max pretends to pass out on their wedding night . \nthe next morning , she feigns illness , sending a very horny dean off to the office , where he ends up in the arms of his new secretary . \njust as the two are about to get overtly physical , max bursts into the room and catches them . \nthe \" horrified \" bride dissolves the union , garnering a healthy cash settlement along the way . \nof course , the secretary was really her daughter page ( hewitt ) and the whole thing was a set-up . \nthe women move on , but an irs agent ( bancroft ) catches up with them and demands a huge amount of money to cover unpaid taxes . \nin desperate need of funds , max and page head for palm beach to replay the scam . \ntheir mark this time is william b . tensy ( hackman , in hideous make-up ) , a decrepit tobacco tycoon obsessed with the joys of smoking . \nmax starts to put the game into action , but page is so repelled by the old man ( and angry with her mom ) that she slips off to enact her own score , targeting jack , a laid back young beach bar owner who is worth a fortune . \ncomplications arise when page realizes that good-natured jack is stirring actual emotions in her steely little heart . \nas if that wasn't enough , dean reappears on the scene with revenge on his mind . \nthe attempt to weld a romance onto a caper comedy served only to remind me of the infinitely superior \" a fish called wanda . \" \ni won't bother to compare the two . \nsuffice to say that everything done right in \" wanda \" is done wrong here . \n \" heartbreakers \" is soulless , inept and , at 123 minutes , at least a half-hour too long . \nsigourney weaver and jennifer love hewitt throw themselves into their parts , but have nowhere to go with the metallic characters . \ngene hackman is utterly wasted in a one-note , one-joke part that has him doing nothing but smoking , coughing and waxing rhapsodic about smoking and sex . \npoor jason lee is stuck in the ingenue role and the normally charismatic actor comes off as merely bland . \nray liotta manages to squeeze a tiny bit of humanity and humor into his walking clich ? , but only a bit . \nthe low point in the film has weaver employing a russian accent bad enough to make boris and natasha wince , while doing half-assed slapstick with a broken off penis from a statue . \nbear in mind , though , that this is merely the worst segment of a movie made up of nothing but low points . \nif you remember bob hope specials with fondness , this might be your cup of tea . \nas for me , i'm going to watch \" a fish called wanda \" now and try to forget i ever saw \" heartbreakers . \" \n", " \" american pie \" alums jason biggs and mena suvari star in this summer's attempt to capitalize on the youth market looking for a comedy about young people they can relate to that combines generic hollywood cute couple-ness and zany comedy . \nit's about an a+ student (

self-respect whatsoever and allows herself to be pushed around just like \" hick-boy \" paul is . \nso we've got a fish-out-water formula mixed with meet-cute romantic comedy which ideally should make for a good movie . \nunfortunately the atrocious screenplay and boring direction by \" clueless \" auteur amy heckerling successfully manages to screw up everything about the film . \nthese characters are totally unrealistic and unbelievable - it's as if everyone under age 30 is a stoned raver . \nthere's no background or details to anyone or anything , it's just a bunch of cartoon characters running into each other . \nnot to mention the story itself which is virtually non-existant and contains so many plotholes it's like swiss cheese . \neven the basic editing is bad . \nif you're looking for a romantic comedy stay far away from this one because it is neither romantic nor funny . \ni saw this in a packed cinema on opening night and the audience barely laughed at all . \nif

of a unanimous critical panning . \nbased on the famous 60's television show , the film was an enormous box-office flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros . a year later , the studio is up to their old tricks again , with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild , wild west . \nbut it sounded promising : the same tag-team of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , who both contributed to make men in black such a financial success , is at the reins again . \nand co-star kevin kline is attached to the project , as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects . \ni mean , what could possibly go wrong ? \nthe answer is just about everything . \nwild wild west is a cinematic abomination - a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate . \nthere are a lot of fancy special effects , and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression . \nbut the script is so deliriously uneven , the entire movie so off course , that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to salvage it . \nat square one , we have a bizarre case of casting . \nwill smith plays james west , a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor robert conrad in the tv series . \nmy guess regarding the casting of african-american smith is a simple one : the actor + a cozy summertime release = big bucks for all those involved . \nsmith is a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material , but this is not an ideal role for him . \nhe's too much of a joker . \ni heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role , and frankly , that sounds a lot more plausible . \nwhat makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such self-assurance in his eyes ; you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hit at the summer box office . \nthe plot involves west and cross-dressing government agent artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , who are assigned by the president to recover a group of kidnapped scientists . \nthe trail leads to the diabolical dr . arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , a man with no lower body who speaks in a dry , witty southern accent . \nloveless has taken the country's top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control , using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns . \none such weapon is an 80-foot mechanical tarantula , bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and right . \nthe visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular , seamlessly blending computer-generated imagery with the western surroundings . \nunfortunately , all of these effects seem so detached from the story , and can do little to support the film's plot deficiencies , which are undoubtedly the main problem . \nwild wild west is a running gag that never truly works . \nmost of the jokes , usually care of smith , die on arrival . \nif it's one thing that could possibly be the saving grace , it's the performances , and even they are mostly off-kilter and poorly delivered . \nkline is admirable , but he has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot . \nsalma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest , because she is viewed as little more than that - window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between west and gordon . \nbranagh , an esteemed shakespearean actor and director , adds marginal enjoyment to the film . \nbut even he is so utterly weird and over-the-top . \nrarely is a film so lost in itself as wild wild west is . \ni suppose there's always one turkey of the summer season ; a highly anticipated , big-budget release that manages to completely disappoint . \nwild wild west is such a movie , and will probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of 1999 . \nbut it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office . \nperhaps after this , audiences will be less assured when they see will smith's name stamped on a summer movie . \nafter such hits as independence day and mib , wild wild west is not an impressive addition to the resume . \n", "at the outset of swordfish , john travolta's gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today . \nbasically , he says , it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers . \nhow ironic , as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture . \nswordfish is loud , violent and amoral . \nit has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life . \nand how does travolta's gabriel plan to do this ? \nby robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out-terrorize terrorists . \nswordfish is a very cynical movie . \nit relies on an audience's perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non-human , faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration . \nthe movie's plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down , you'd actually see how ridiculous it all is . \nthis is a live-action road runner cartoon , moving so quickly that it's over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions . \nthe storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson ( hugh jackman ) , recruited by gabriel to crack the government's computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his anti-terrorist campaign . \ntalk about whacked-out patriotism . \nmy objections to swordfish are many . \nthe body count is high , but that is expected in a movie of this sort . \nit's becoming a bore watching anonymous soldiers , police officers and government agents blown to bits . \nanother example is the family dynamics between stanley , his 10-year-old daughter and his ex-wife . \nstanley , though having served time in prison for hacking , is shown as a loving and caring father , forbidden by his ex to see his little girl . \naudience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husband's adult films . \nthus when she is found murdered late in the movie , neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve . \nin fact , subconsciously , many in the audience are probably glad she was killed . \nthen there is the sequence involving one of gabriel's henchman holding a gun to the head of stanley's daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel . \nchildren as pawns have become a most unwelcome clich ? in recent films . \nthere is enough violence in the real world involving children without having to make them on-screen victims as well . \nyea , it's only make believe , but that doesn't mean you have to tolerate it . \ntravolta is cool , deadly charming and flamboyant as the near-crazy gabriel . \nhis character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in broken arrow and face/off . \njackman looks dour through most of the proceedings . \nhis only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database . \nhis sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate . \nhalle berry is decorative and lovely as gabriel's assistant , while don cheadle is given little to do as the head fbi agent hunting gabriel . \nswordfish plays like a comic book with a larger-than-life character in gabriel . \nviewers align themselves with him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or villain . \nand maybe that is the movie's underlying flaw : there is no real hero to speak of , only those doing their upmost to survive . \nand that is not enough . \nthis is one swordfish that should have been thrown back in the water . \n", "it's probably inevitable that the popular virtual reality genre ( \" the matrix , \" \" existenz \" ) would collide with the even more popular serial-killer genre ( \" kiss the girls , \" \" se7en \" ) . \nthe result should have been more interesting than \" the cell . \" \nas the movie opens , therapist catharine deane ( jennifer lopez ) treats a catatonic boy ( colton james ) by entering his mind through some sort of virtual reality technique that's never fully explained . \nafter months of therapy sessions in a surreal desert , catharine has no success to report . \nmeanwhile , killer carl stargher ( vincent d'onofrio ) has claimed another victim . \nhis particular hobby is to kidnap young women , keep them in a glass cell overnight , and drown them . \nhe takes the corpse and soaks it in bleach , then suspends himself over the body and jerks off while watching a video tape of the drowning . \nalthough carl's been doing this for awhile , he's recently become sloppy , and fbi agent peter novak ( vince vaughn ) is closing in fast . \nnot fast enough , though , to keep carl from sticking another woman ( tara subkoff ) in the cell or to catch him before he suffers a schizophrenic attack that leaves him in a coma . \nfrom the videos in carl's house , peter can see that the drowning cell is automated and will fill with water forty hours after the abduction . \nto save the kidnapped girl , peter has to find the cell before the end of the day , and comatose carl's not talking . \nso off they go to catharine in the hope that she can go inside carl's mind and find out where the cell is in time . \nthe focus of \" the cell \" in on the ornate interior of carl's mind , but the universe director tarsem singh creates seems more an exercise in computer-generated spectacle than an exploration of the psychotic personality . \nfor the most part , it's style without substance . \nin his own mind , carl is a decadent emperor in flowing robes , ming the merciless , as well as a frightened boy ( jake thomas ) abused by his father . \nall in all , the mind of a psycho killer turns out to be a strangely dull place , and i kept wishing i could fast-forward to the next development . \nsingh is best known for directing music videos , particularly rem's \" losing my religion , \" and \" the cell \" seems very much like a really long , really slow mtv video with the sound deleted . \nsinger lopez seems to think she's in a video as well ; she devotes more time to posing in elaborate costumes than she does to acting . \nthe premise had great promise . \nthe computer-generated world within carl's mind could have been a bizarre , surreal universe governed by insanity and symbolism rather than logic . \nthe first room catharine enters in carl's head shows this promise . \nshe finds a horse standing in center of the room ; suddenly , sheets of sharp-edged glass fall into the horse , dividing it into segments . \nthe panes of glass separate , pulling apart the pieces of the still-living horse . \nthis scene is twisted , disturbing , and thought-provoking , because the psychological importance of the horse and its fate is left to the viewer to ponder . \nanother element that should have been developed is the effect on catharine of merging with the mind of a psychopath . \ntheir minds begin to bleed together at one point in the movie , and this should have provided an opportunity to discover the dark corners of catharine's own psyche . \nlike sidney lumet's \" the offence \" or michael mann's \" manhunter , \" \" the cell \" could have explored how the madness of the killer brings out a repressed darkness in the investigator . \nhowever , catharine's character is hardly developed at all , and lopez has no depth to offer the role . \nbottom line : don't get trapped in this one . \n", "synopsis : an aging master art thief , his supplier , and a young , buxom security consultant are all not who they first appear to be ( or are they ? ) in this convoluted mess involving a risky heist during the millennium . \ncomments : this movie was boring . \nplain and simple . \nentrapment should not have been boring . \nit stars sean connery , who can still carry an action film despite his age , catherine zeta-jones , a likeable enough film presence , and ving rhames , ultra-cool star of pulp fiction and mission : impossible . \nit takes full advantage of the y2k computer bug fears ( a current \" hot topic \" in the news ) in its storyline , which is set at the end of 1999 . \nit has some genuinely well-staged action sequences . \nso , what went wrong ? \nplenty , unfortunately . \nthe major problem with entrapment is its script . \nit has a been-there , done-that feel to it . \nnothing seems particularly inventive or original , so the whole movie lacks suspense and drags ( it runs nearly two hours ) . \nthe screenwriters , for example , periodically use a countdown to the millennium as a means of transition between scenes ( i . e . \n \" 4 days to the millennium \" ) . \nthis device was used much more effectively in the overlooked sci-fi film strange days . \nthe characters are not who they appear to be at the beginning , which is neat at first but the device wears thin once the umpteenth \" surprise \" revelation is made . \nentrapment , in other words , relies too heavily on the audience not knowing what each character's true motive is , resulting in a convoluted story which leaves many scratching their heads in confusion . \nthe star power here is quite strong , but the viewer can't help but feel the actors are wasted in this production . \nsean connery is given such mind-numbing lines as \" never trust a naked woman . \" \nving rhames' character seems like an afterthought ; he's not developed at all . \nthe camera zooms in frequently and leeringly at catherine zeta-jones's tight wardrobe . \nthis , in and of itself , is not bad , but , after a while , it has a juvenile feel to it . \nat least the species movies hold no bones about the fact that they're exploiting the female body . \nentrapment does the same under the thin disguise of plot development ( sean connery supposedly falls in love with the girl while watching her , in tights , arc and pivot around laser beams ) . \nthe tagline for this movie reads \" the trap is set . \" \nit sure is , on those who spent money to see this movie . \nentrapment really isn't that bad ; it is watchable . \ni would suggest , however , one waits until this is on cable or television to see it . \n", "the

confusing and boring . \nnote : the following reveals the basic plot . \nif you want to have a fighting chance of making any sense of the movie , i suggest you read it . \nearth is at war with aliens that appear to feed on human souls . \nmost of our planet is devastated , with humans living in a few protected cities . \nwhile the bulk of the survivors focus on military strategies , aki ross ( voiced by ming-na ) and her mentor , dr . sid ( donald sutherland ) , believe in a more organic approach . \nthey operate on the notion ( quoting straight from the press kit ) \" that all life forms have signature spirit waves that can be identified and contained . \naki and dr . sid collect a series of organic specimens whose spirit signatures combined will form a wave of equal and opposite intensity to the spirit wave of the alien force . \nthe waves will , in effect , cancel each other out and disarm the foreign contagion . \nthey have collected six of the eight key spirits needed to complete their wave . \nthey are on a desperate hunt to find the remaining two spirits before their time runs out . \" \nare you still with me ? \nthere's only a little more . \naki is infected with

most of the anime i've seen , the plot combines apocalyptic settings , lots of shooting and fuzzy spirituality , all wrapped up in a save-the-earth bow . \nbut i'm bored with apocalyptic settings . \ni understand why so many live-action films employ them ? they're cheap ? but animated films can show anything , so why wallow in an industrial trash heap ? \nthe action scenes and shoot-em-ups don't satisfy either . \nthe humans move oddly and their facial features are so muted that the talented voice cast can't bring them to life ( in fact , their efforts merely emphasize what we're missing ) . \naki is especially disappointing ; with her lack of expression and flat delivery , she looks and sound like a brunet version of weena , the eloi girl from 1960's \" the time machine . \" \ndrab color

\ncritique : wow . \ni really can't remember the last time a movie sucked on so many levels ! \nthe \" comedy \" in this film is pathetic , obvious and dated ( oj simpson jokes galore ) . \nthe plot is uninteresting , boring and bad . \nthe structure of the film is annoying , repetitive and pretentious . \nthe acting is pretty bad , especially jackie chan , who can't act to save his life . \nthe cameos are lame and seem forced , and the ending blows chunks . \nall in all , this movie believes itself to be a clever , humorous and edgy look behind the closed doors of hollywood , but comes across as a boring , stupid and completely unentertaining piece of shite . \ni love to see movies about hollywood shenanigans , but this one bites the big one . \nsee it if you like to watch really bad movies , otherwise skip it , because it will just have you hating every star that makes an appearance in it . \nluckily for us all , this mess only lasts about 80 minutes , and miramax honcho harvey weinstein plays a lead-faced detective . \nby the way , is there any reason why the studio or the producer couldn't have cut another version of the film by the way of all the filmed stock that was left over ? \nwho knows , who cares , this \" satire \" sucks the bag . \nlittle known facts about this film and its stars : ironically , the original director of this film , arthur hiller , also requested his name be taken off the credits and replaced by the dga's alan smithee moniker . \nthis was after the film's production company , cinergi pictures , preferred the cut made by producer/writer joe eszterhas to his . \nthe original script of this film included arnold schwarzenegger and bruce willis . \neszterhas announced through the media during post-production that cinergi pictures didn't have the money to pay for soundtrack . \nhe said that he would finance the soundtrack from his own money and asked to submit tracks for it to him . \nhe received 9 , 200 cds and cassettes from mostly unknown and unsigned artists , listened to all that was sent ( at least a couple of tracks from each record ) and compiled the soundtrack . \nthis film practically swept the \" razzie awards \" in 1999 , given out to the worst of all movie categories of the year , with no less than the \" worst picture \" award , the \" worst screenplay \" ( joe eszterhas ) , the \" worst supporting actor \" ( joe eszterhas ) , the \" worst new star \" ( joe eszterhas tied with jerry springer ) and the \" worst original song \" ( \" i wanna be mike ovitz ! \" \nas written by joe eszterhas ) . \n", "plot : a rich guy who doesn't believe in love , orders a mail-order bride for himself . \nthat very evening , the couple is married and fall madly in love soon thereafter . \nbut what's this ? \none of them might not be the person they are pretending to be ? \nwow . . . a \nsin , indeed . \ncritique : easily one of the worst movies that i've seen all year . \ntoo long , too boring , too predictable and too ridiculous for anyone interested in watching a good movie . \nwhat the hell were they thinking when they made this thing ? \n ( it's no wonder that the film has been sitting on the racks for about a year ) this felt like a really bad tv movie of the week , with some nudity stuffed in from time to time , just to wake up the audience . \nhave you ever switched channels and fallen upon one of those ridiculously melodramatic tv movies , one that you just couldn't help but switch back to from time to time , just to make sure that it wasn't part of some sick joke ? \nwell , this movie is exactly like that , only it isn't a joke , it isn't on tv and you are asked to pay money to see it ! ! \ni say again . . . what the shite were they thinking ? \nokay , so where do i start ? \nfirst of all , the trailer of this film gives away the movie's main plot twist , the betrayal . \nso for the first half hour of the film , you're basically just sitting there , watching these two \" lovers \" go through the motions until the \" betrayal \" occurs . \nwhoopee , big surprise . \nsecond of all , angelina jolie is horribly miscast in this part . \nwhy ? \nwell , it's like this : not for one second do you ever believe that she is not a nasty backstabbing woman ! \ni mean , it's like all of those people who complained about jack nicholson being psycho from the start of the shining , well , the same goes here . \nevery look in jolie's eyes screams \" psycho \" ! \nthen of course , you have the case of the \" patsy \" husband , a man who just can't seem to figure out anything in time . \ni mean . . . how \nboring is that for the audience ? \nyou're watching this guy screw up time after time after time , and somehow , we're supposed to feel sorry or care about this dude . \nno , thanks ! \nand if we don't care about him , and we really don't care about her ( she's a beeyatch and as confused as we are about her actual motivations in the film ) , who the hell are we supposed to care about in this film ? \nwell , i'll tell you . \nthe only thing that i was worrying about the whole way through this picture was whether or not i'd actually fall asleep before the end credits rolled . \nno suspense , no chemistry between the leads , no real love or passion , no sense of surprise , plenty of plot holes for everyone and an extra moronic ending . \nso why am i even giving this film a rating of three points ? \nwell , it's actually pretty simple . \ni liked the locations in the movie and the groovy score , but my primary reason for slipping three notches onto this bedpost is for the gratuitous shots of jolie's boobies ( that's two points right there ! ) and another one for antonio's ass ( hairless , just for the record ) . \neverything else in this movie was pointless , boring and just plain stupid . \ntry imagining a soft-porn movie . . . but \nwithout the plot ! \nthat's pretty much what you've got here . \na low point in the careers of both stars . \noops , i almost forgot to mention the crappy dialogue . . . god \noh mighty . . . make \nit stop ! ! \nwhere's joblo coming from ? \namerican psycho ( 9/10 ) - cruel intentions ( 8/10 ) - eyes wide shut ( 6/10 ) - fatal attraction ( 8/10 ) - playing by heart ( 7/10 ) - under suspicion ( 7/10 ) - what lies beneath ( 8/10 ) - what women want ( 4/10 ) - whipped ( 7/10 ) \n", "not a great twelve months for either of the principals from this movie . \nearlier this year , nora ephron wrote and produced one of the year's least likeable \" comedies \" called hanging up , featuring a bunch of annoying women ( ironically , lisa kudrow played one in that film as well ) who barely have time to care about anyone but themselves . \nick . . . real \nsweet stuff . \nbut her little unsuccessful project was nothing compared to what john travolta went through earlier this summer , with a film entitled battlefield earth . \ni seemed to be the only person on this planet who somehow appreciated the film , even if it was on a \" cheese \" factor , as everybody , and i mean everybody else , pretty much classified the movie as one of the worst disasters of all time . \nyipes . . . another \nbeauty . \nso what happens when you put these two people in the same room and come out with a movie co-starring the ever-versatile lisa kudrow ? \nuhhhm , you guessed it . . . not \nmuch . \nplot : in order to escape major financial difficulties , a local weatherman hooks up with his ball-picking lotto girlfriend and rigs the state lottery . \nbut as more and more people find out about their scheme , more and more people demand a part of their winnings , and more and more problems arise . \ncritique : simply stated , i didn't laugh once during this entire picture . \nfor a comedy , it offered me a few smiles , a bunch of nincompoops as characters , a miscast john travolta hamming it up and lisa kudrow , in what can only described as a \" sluttier \" version of her character of phoebe on tv's \" friends \" . \nthis film was not as disastrous as i thought it would be , but it was pretty close . \nthankfully , the clips of travolta dressed up in goofy outfits , dancing as the weatherman were left in the film's trailer , and not in this final cut . \nand not unlike the worst movie of the year so far , beautiful , this film also managed to feature many unsympathetic , idiotic and just plain irritating characters in its cast . \nforemost was travolta's character , who declined to give us any reason to care for him once in the entire movie . \nand for me , the casting choice of john travolta for this role was just plain wrong . \nhe didn't fit the part . \ni just saw him in get shorty the other day and thought about how perfect he was for that role . \na cool , calculating roughneck with a certain hip , suave \" je ne sais quoi \" . \nin this film , he looks like he's trying to be funny , trying to be bad , trying to be good . \nwe're not supposed to be able to notice that , and when we do , at least in my case , i consider it a wrong choice in casting . \nadd that to lisa kudrow , boring us with yet another one of her patented \" dumb blonde \" routines , but this time , dressed in sexier outfits . \nmichael rapaport , stretching one small acting muscle to play the guy who isn't quite up at the same speed level as everyone else . \nand a truckload of empty comedic bullet shells , and you've got yourself an extremely quiet audience anticipating punch lines that never quite materialize . \nthe only real good thing that i could say about this film is that its story was actually half-interesting and never really bored me . \ni also liked michael moore's perverted cousin character , and i loved , and i say it again , loved the character that bill pullman played . \ngive this dude his own movie ! \nhe played a lazy cop , a man who tries everything not to do any real work . \nhe fakes injuries to get off duty , tries to avoid arrest situations so that he won't have to fill out any forms . . . now \nthere's a base of humor . \nsadly , the filmmakers decided to bring him into play with only about half an hour left in the film . \nand there's not much else i can say about this movie , folks . \non the whole , it was lame , included a slew of unlikable characters fiddling around in a pool of unfunny lines , and very little of interest for any target audience . \nbut get somebody to write up a movie featuring that lazy cop played by pullman and i'm there ! \n", "the stereotypical american male has an undeniable fetishistic love of sports cars . \nproducer jerry bruckheimer plays upon that attraction with a movie so loaded with testosterone and laced titillatingly with shot after frenetic shot of powerful muscle cars , sleek foreign road huggers and iconic speed machines that many males will leave the theater in an orgasmic haze . \ngone is 60 seconds is an orgy of maleness gone horribly awry . \ncage is legendary retired car thief , memphis raines ( don't you love cute movie names ) , who must call upon his time worn skills to save his thick-headed brother ( ribisi ) from being killed . \nseems a murderous crime boss ( eccleston ) with a fetish for wood ( insert your own joke ) hired brother kip to steal a ridiculous amount of expensive , exotic autos . \nfifty cars , to be exact . \npoor kip screws the pooch and bungles the job badly . \nif the cars aren't delivered in three days , bossman has a casket carved out just for kip . \nliterally . \nif only someone could save him . \nhmmmm . . wonder \nwhat memphis is doing ? \nin order to give the film some emotional heft , there are several subplots designed to tug at our heartstrings or give us the thrill of . . . yawn , excuse me , dramatic tension . \nshadowing memphis is an old law enforcement foe ( lindo ) who's looking to send memphis away . \nwill he catch him ? \nthere's old flame sway ( jolie ) , who had her heart broken by memphis years ago . \nwill they get back together ? \nshortsighted , thrill seeker kip idolizes his brother , yet resents him for moving away from the family . \nwill they reconnect ? \nraines old mentor ( duvall ) has long since left the life of crime . \nwill memphis get him finally caught as he pulls him back into the life , one more time ? \ncan you answer all these questions correctly in 2 seconds without seeing the film first ? \ni'll bet you can . \nfollowing the opening credits , which fill you in on the accomplishments of the raines family through a montage of old photos , we was taken full throttle into the splendor that is memphis . \nhe's first shown living the good life teaching young children to drive go-carts . \nin a later scene , as misfit brother kip knowingly tells memphis he has the stolen car situation under control , all the while making breakfast , a metaphor is made of shakespearean proportions . \njust as a pan of grease flares up with kip clueless to how to quell it , big brother memphis calmly and efficiently throws some salt on it . \nlooks like everything might turn out alright after all . \nyou know this because the music swells on the crest of violins . \nthat's about as strong as the characterization gets , which is a shame . \nbruckheimer has a real talent for loading his movies with an obscene amount of talent given the task at hand . \nmonumentally underused jolie portrays an empty headed sexpot whose idea of sex revolves around cars and memphis . \nor maybe it's just the cars . \nduvall trots out his ornery , but sweet old codger outfit . \ni'm sure he's still laughing at taking a paycheck for this one . \nlindo projects a warm hearted , but tightly focused detective that almost transcends the material . \nthe biggest waste of resources is vinnie jones , who plays a mute accomplice of memphis . \nwithout saying a word , he is easily the most charismatic person in the movie . \nlike a blast of nitrous oxide , he attacks each scene with a straightforward zeal . \ntoo bad his minutes onscreen are so few . \nsomehow , bruckheimer manages to attract top hollywood acting talent to high concept , poorly written movies , gussies up the film with lots of gold hues and pleasingly stylized action and they sell like proverbial hotcakes . \nevery time something clever happens it's counterbalanced by something so overtly wrong that it jerks you back into realizing you're watching a movie . \nthere's a innovative usage of black lighting that goes from being a novelty to a part of the plot . \nit's counterbalanced by an extremely feeble attempt at humor by having an asian american repeatedly failing a driver's test . \nimagine the yuks . \nthere's a segment where one of the thieves shows another his cool fake fingerprint trick . \nit's countered by the lame semi-subplot of a car being stolen with a bunch of heroin in the trunk . \nthe ramifications are never explored . \nthen there's the ridiculousness of the many cops who actually shoot at fleeing cars . \nnot only is it stupid , but it's against the law . \nthis is a movie made of pretty , but tepid car chases strung together by just enough character interaction to move the plot along . \ngone in 60 seconds aptly describes how long it'll take for this marginally entertaining , but empty film to leave your memory . \n", "first and foremost i think this movie comes to grief at the hands of the pg rating it's been given . \nfor those of us who haven't read the james lee burke novel that heaven's prisoners is based on , do not rabidly go out and buy tickets to movies featuring the combined talents of alec baldwin and eric roberts , feel vaguely depressed by the notion of swamps , gangsters with louisiana accents , plots , sub-plots , more plots , and well , really just want to see teri hatcher naked , this is one movie you're going to worry the price of admission over . \nhopeful still ? \nwell , let me share my moment of sheer panic , and then the cold enervation of the big let-down when a semi-robed hatcher purrs to alec baldwin , \" what do you think of my butterfly ? \" . \nbutterfly ? , \ni asked myself , what butterfly ? ! \nand then it hit me . . . \nthe scene had been snipped ! \ndamn you , godless pg rating , show us her butterfly ! ! \nwe want to see the goddamn butterfly ! ! ! \nso . . . \nno naked teri hatcher . \nforget about that . \nokay ? \nnow . . . \nheaven's prisoners is about ex-alchoholic ex-cop dave robicheaux ( alec baldwin ) who's trying to discover life anew running a bait shop and boat hire business with his loving , down-to-earth wife annie ( kelly lynch ) . \neverything dull , but hunky dory until a plane carrying illegal immigrants crashes almost ontop of the couple while they're on their boat . \nthe plane nosedives into the water and sinks , but from its wreckage robicheaux rescues a little pixie-faced salvadoran girl whom he and his wife immediately decide to adopt . \nwhat they don't realise is that the plane's pilot was also a drug dealer , and that the plane had been sabotaged by the latter's erstwhile colleagues . \nwhen robicheaux discovers this , he predictably , against the advice of his wife , a well-meaning dea agent , and two gangsters who rough him up , begins 'poking his nose where it don't belong' , we know that the man deserves all the misery he's going to get . \nthe question now is whether or not you want to be dragged along for the ride through a tedious , meandering yet utterly suspenseless plot with an unlovable hero as your guide . \nas dave robicheaux , alec baldwin is fat . . . \nno seriously , this is not the svelte , thinking man's hero of the hunt for red october , it is an out-of-shape guy who doesn't look too good in a roof-top chasing scene . \nhe's also unconvincing in the movie's dramatic moments , acting with what as far as i can tell is a steven segal-like economy of expression . \nthree-quarters of the way through the show , while you're probably waiting for the next scene in a bar where robicheaux contemplates succumbing to the temptation of the whiskey bottle , getting drunk and beating up someone or getting beaten up , you'll want to beat on him a little yourself . \non the other hand , mary stuart masterson ( some kind of wonderful , fried green tomatoes , benny & joon ) cast as a down-and-out stripper who has her fingers broken is quite a breath of fresh air , with just the right mix of cynicism , warmth , insecurity and humour to be the movie's only endearing character . \neric roberts as bubba rocque , always believable as the woman-abusing bad guy who knows how to box ( see final analysis , coincidentally also directed by phil joanou ) is believable here as the woman-abusing bad guy who knows how to box . \nand lest we forget teri hatcher's role in all this , this being her rather well-publicised paid vacation from playing lois lane on tv's \" adventures of lois & clark \" . . . \nshe is totally ridiculous as rocque's manipulative and seductive cajun wife , coming across as devious as a mildly disgruntled au pair who's trying to get back at an employer who hasn't been giving her enough days off . \nit's probably safe to say that her day job beckons . \nand at the end of our day , none of this is really worth 2 hrs and 12 minutes of our personal misery . \nthe flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video . \n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \n * * * * * perfection . \nsee it twice . \n", "it's amazing how a comedian can have the some of the funniest stand-up around but completely fall flat in the movies . \ntake adam sandler . \non the basis of his first two cds ( \" they're all gonna laugh at you ! \" \nand \" what the hell happened to me ? \" ) , \nhe's the best thing to hit comedy since robin williams . \nbut when you put him in front of a camera , it just isn't the same . \ni kind of enjoyed happy gilmore and thought that it warranted a marginal recommendation , but his latest film , the waterboy is about as funny as a root canal . \nseriously , i'm willing to wager than there were more laughs in saving private ryan than there are here . \nin fact , i found this movie to be more depressing than comedic . \nthe first half hour generated not one smile in me , with it's scenes of emotional abuse towards adam's character of bobby boucher not only by the cruel football players , but also by his very disturbed mother ( kathy bates - what is the world coming to ? ) . \ngranted , after the film gets rolling , there are a few mild chuckles throughout ( i'm even willing to admit that it actually had me laughing once or twice ) , but not nearly enough to sustain the waterboy for it's nearly hour and a half running time . \nyou're all familiar with the plot because you've seen it at least a million times before ; everyone picks on the hero until he shows a hidden talent and leads the underdog team to victory over the champions , in the process not only winning the respect of his teammates but also getting the woman he loves . \nand believe me , i'm not giving anything away by saying that sandler's team wins . \nif you would actually feel any degree of suspense watching this movie , then god be with you . \nthe only things that keep this bomb from getting the big banana are the winning performances from henry winkler as the insecure coach and the severely underrated fairuza balk as bobby's love interest . \ni mean , they should be lending their talents to some loftier purpose , but they do extremely well with what they are given here . \nkudos to both of them . \nmy advice to adam is to try and follow in the footsteps of veteran comedians like williams and steve martin , who made a very smooth and successful transition from stage to screen . \nrely more on actual comedy rather than strange voices and rude noises to make people laugh . \nor maybe even show what dramatic talent he might have , like jim carrey did with the recent truman show . \nwith the obvious and considerable talent that he possesses , he just can't keep going on like this . \n", "according to popular film opinion , a film's greatness is determined by time . \ntake for example \" casablanca . \" \ngreat film , even today . \nit's still as powerful as it was when it came out and still as romantic and tragic . \nanother example would be \" star wars , \" which had a very , very healthy box office gross despite the fact that we had all seen it about 3 billion times before . \nbut as i rewatched \" independence day \" when it came out on video after being the number one hit of 1996 , i kinda felt like it wasn't as cool as when i had first seen it . \ni had liked it when i saw it the first time ( * * * was my original view ) and basically saw it as a good \" escape film . \" \nbut when i rewatched it , i felt cheated . \nthus , the curse of the \" event film . \" \n \" independence day \" is like that kid who come out of nowhere and makes everybody happy at once ( except for a couple kids - the critics , in this situation ) . \nbut after a while , this kid becomes annoying and you just wait for the next one . \nwell , this kid is the \" event film \" in my little analogy . \nand when i rewatched \" independence day , \" not only did it not look cooler at all on the big screen , but i felt insulted the whole time . \nthere are too many gaping craters in the plot and you just aren't sure if it's comedy or hokey drama . \none scene , you'll see a hilariously nebbish scene between jeff goldblum and judd hirsch ; the next you'll see a bunch of military uptight guys walking around , saying corny lines . \nthe worst is a scene between brent spiner and bill pullman where spiner is sayinig something innocently funny but is barked like a junkyard dog by bill pullman who gives him the most unitentionally funniest speech since the end of \" glen or glenda ? \" \nnow this annoying kid's problem is that in the process of trying to make everyone like him all at once , he shows he has no balls . \nand \" independence day \" has no balls . \nit plays it safe everywhere . \nit throws in a ton of action that is borrowed from other superior films . \nthe chase scene between the alien ship and will smith is straight out of \" star wars . \" \ni mean , isn't that devil's den ? \nand the aliens are about as anticlimactic as demi moore's breasts in \" striptease . \" \nthey're these octopus men , boring freaking octopus men . \ni mean , come on . \nthe aliens in \" 2001 \" were more interesting and you didn't even see them ! \nbasically the plot is straight from a b-movie from the 50s : aliens come to earth and we wonder if they're hostile or peaceful . \nokay , it's an interesting topic , but it's not handled greatly . \nnow they aren't and somehow a computer geek , jeff goldblum , figure out they're using our satellites as a countdown to destruction . \nyep . \nthese aliens are not only heavily armed , they're stupid too . \nthey also use the same kind of computer as we do , but that comes about later . \nthe president ( bill pullman ) , who's under attack for being a wimp , decides this would be a nice time to be belligerent , and he decides he'll stay in the white house which the aliens have covered . \ni don't care if it's bob freaking dole in the white house , get him out of there . \ni don't care if you have to inject him with sodium pentathol , just get him out of there . \nlater on , he's stupid and wants to fly in the attack on a big alien ship . \ni think it's time for impeachment for this guy . \nhe's more senile than reagan on pot . \nthen there's a cocky pilot ( will smith ) who is the only person to survive the counter-attack on the second day and becomes moses in leading his children to the elusive area 51 ( the film's only sign of being brave ) . \nhis girlfriend's a stripper sharing a subplot with \" striptease \" in that she has to do it for her son . \ncome on , she has a fighter pilot boyfriend/soon-to-be fiance . \ni think she can quit that job and get a more respectable job at long john silvers . \nshe's also the few , the proud , the lucky to survive the igniting of l . a . ( as well as her dog , who narrowly survives ) . \nthere are some bright spots . \nthey tossed in enough old film homages to keep me laughing . \nthe best one is when jeff goldblum ( nicely named david ) turns on his computer and a picture of hal comes up and says , \" good morning , dave . \" \nand they even played r . e . m . 's \n \" it's the end of the world as we know it ( and i feel fine ) at the beginning . \nand judd hirsch steals the film by actually acting great ( he's a stereotype , but i just loved the man anyway ) . \nbut there are no real subtle comic moments . \nwill gets way too many one-liners and he has no one to play off of ( execept jeff towards the end , and the two do great ) . \nas i said , this film has no balls . \nit is just aiming for a crowd pleaser and that's what it is . \nbut after a couple months , we all move on to the next \" event \" film while intaking little films and a couple indy ones for good measure . \nbut at least the indy ones last for a lifetime . \nthis one's short on batteries . \n", "by trying to satisfy every kind of viewer , it's possible that sphere may end up pleasing no one . \naction lovers will be bored by what they will see as an interminably boring setup . \naudience members who crave more intellectual fare will be disgusted by the film's sudden collapse into mindless storytelling and by the ending , which is an insulting cop-out . \nsomewhere out there , maybe there's a small cadre of film-goers who will appreciate sphere's dubious charms , but i'm not among them . \ni sincerely hope the novel is better than the movie ( i no longer read anything by either michael crichton or john grisham ) , because if the finished motion picture product is anything to go by , it's hard to understand why the rights were optioned . \nsphere is the kind of first- class mess that only a top-line director with an a-list cast can create . \nwith expectations high ( and how could they not be , considering that another barry levinson/dustin hoffman collaboration , the excellent wag the dog , is still playing in theaters ? ) , \nsomething this bad can't help but look even worse . \nthe last time a big-name , big-budget film displayed this level of ineptitude was last year's batman & robin , and everyone knows how that movie was received . \nsphere starts out a little like an amalgamation of contact and james cameron's the abyss , but , somewhere along the way , it collapses into the cellar with another recent science fiction effort , event horizon . \nscience and philosophy , which are used to good effect during sphere's first hour , give way to mindless , confusing action sequences . \nattempts at characterization fall apart . \nintelligent writing , which is evident early on , is replaced by hackneyed drivel . \nspecial effects take over as the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness . \nbut all that is just in preparation for the ending , which is inexcusably awful . \nthis is the time-honored deus ex machina device used to its worst effect . \ni left the theater feeling cheated by the way crichton and his screenwriters had chosen to end the film . \nthere is some promise , but it's all in the setup . \nwe're introduced to norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) , a psychologist who once wrote a $35 , 000 report for the government about what to do in the event that a crashed space ship is discovered . \nwhen one is found in the middle of nowhere , 1000 feet below the surface of the pacific ocean , norman is called in to be part of the welcoming committee . \non the team with him are beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , a biochemist who was once his student and lover ; harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , a mathematician who earned his first doctorate at the age of 18 ; ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) , an astrophysicist who is awed by the opportunity to explore alien technology ; and harold barnes ( peter coyote ) , the government operative in charge of the mission . \ntogether , the five descend into the bowels of the ocean , where they rendezvous with a temporary sea base on the ocean floor from which they will attempt to make first contact . \nfor a while , sphere had me fooled into thinking it was going to take an astute approach to the man-meets-alien situation . \nthe overall scenario is not without promise and several plot twists ( such as the revelation that the enormous craft is actually an american space ship , apparently from the future ) offer intriguing possibilities . \nthen , right around the one-hour mark ( that's the time to sneak into the theater next door and check out whatever's left of titanic ) , the virtually non-stop action begins , and , once it starts , the script becomes superfluous . \nthis might be acceptable if director levinson generated some legitimate tension , but , instead , he relies on loud , overbearing music , strange camera angles , and quick cuts to make things \" exciting . \" \nadditionally , because none of the characters are well-formed ( a common failing in anything penned by crichton , who's more interested in technology than people ) , viewers don't develop much of a rooting interest . \nit makes sitting through sphere a frustrating and pointless experience . \nwhat about that a-list cast ? \nnot surprisingly , the most energetic performance is given by samuel l . jackson , but his harry isn't a person ; he's a walking plot device spouting occasionally-witty dialogue . \ndustin hoffman isn't lively or particularly good -- it's ironic that this , which may be his worst work in a decade , has arrived in theaters on the heels of his best actor nomination ( for wag the dog ) . \nsharon stone and peter coyote are both flat . \ntheir characters exhibit little evidence of emotion ; automatons would have been as effective . \nthen there's queen latifa , who , despite getting fifth billing in the credits ( ahead of liev schreiber , who boasts at least quadruple her screen time ) , has less than a handful of lines and almost nothing to do other than inflate the body count . \ni like to think that levinson and hoffman , recognizing how uninspired this movie was likely to be , chose to make wag the dog as a sort of penance ( the low-budget picture was filmed during sphere's lengthy pre-production phase ) . \nif that's the case , forgiveness is granted . \ni'm less inclined to look favorably upon crichton , although he has a few enjoyable titles on his resume ( jurassic park and the levinson-directed disclosure come to mind ) . \neven if his novel was butchered in the adaptation process , crichton's credit as a producer disallows him absolution . \nhe was a willing participant in a creative travesty . \nno wonder sphere is being released in february , in the midst of the early year's cinematic wasteland . \nit deserves no better than to get sunk by the unstoppable titanic , which should plow sphere under on its way to a ninth-consecutive weekend atop the box office heap . \n", "shakespeare in love is quite possibly the most enjoyable period piece ever made for the silver screen . \nit is both humorous and romantic in a very unique blend that can successfully entertain any audience for the nearly 2 and and a half hours that it occupies . \nthat is , however , not to say it is a good film , a quality production or anything of the sort . \nshakespeare in love is an incredibly cheap illusion that truly pans out to be very little quality or original work . \nthe finest sign of this may be the plot , in looking back , there seems to be little more than a thin , predictable plot that is only carried by the portrayal of people that we revere in our history books . \nphilip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) owns 1 of the 2 theatres in london . \nit is at the peak of the royal theatre era , and queen elizabeth ( the recently damed judi dench , by , appropriately enough , queen elizabeth ii ) is very much a fan . \nhowever , to directly quote the film , he has \" cash flow problems . \" \nthrough a long set of events , it becomes apparent that his entire life is dependent on his next show doing well enough to pay off his debts . \nso , mr . henslowe employs the young playwright , william shakespeare ( joseph fiennes ) to pen a comedic production . \nhowever , the young writer has a severe case of writer's block , and blames it on the fact that his love life is struggling as well . \nhe has the title in mind , romeo and ethel , the pirate's daughter ( even that joke loses steam after a while ) but can't seem to put words to paper . \nthen , as only hollywood could have it , through a long set of twisted events , he meets viola de lesseps ( gwyneth paltrow ) and falls madly in love , thus curing his writer's block . \nthere are many other little issues that mr . henslowe encounters , but they all pan out to be much ado about nothing . \nthe first realization that i reached in watching this film is that one of the messages given is that a show should not always be credited to it's author . \nironically , that couldn't be truer here . \nthe great scenes that will sweep audiences away are not the scenes that fit in the plot , but rather the recitals of shakespearean lines by actors playing actors . \none of the most breathtaking moments in this film does not involve the character of shakespeare or queen elizabeth or even the theatre owner , but rather 2 young children named romeo and juliet who chose to end their own lives in the name of love . \nso it is that i am offended by the fact that marc norman and tom stoppard are credited with writing this production , and the name william shakespeare is no were to be seen beyond a character's name in the credits . \nthe acting in this entertaining yet poor film is often thin to the point that it would not have survived even in queen elizabeth's theatres . \njoseph fiennes may just be the worst of fall though . \nhe is tragically unbelievable and comically bad . \ngwyneth paltrow is little more than satisfactory in her lead position as well . \nhowever , the supporting cast does almost save the day . \ngeoffrey rush is nothing short of incredible and judi dench is breathtaking . \nthey both seem to have shown that as proven actors they could survive in this film of weak links . \nyou will also find a very good performance by ben affleck in his first real role since good will hunting ( no , armageddon doesn't qualify as real acting . ) . \nand rupert everett was cute in his small part as well . \nbut not even they could save this sad excuse for a film , so it remains plagued by poor performances . \nwhen all is said and done , shakespeare in love is only worth the trip if you want to be entertained . \nhowever , as the film so kindly pointed out , entertainment may be fun , but it isn't necessarily quality . \nand this certainly isn't quality . \nperhaps this may be best compared to a john grisham novel , as a dear friend of mine often does compare things to his work . \nsimply put , it is far-fetched , poorly crafted , but very entertaining . \n", "at times , you'd think edtv would be an entertaining film . \ni mean , who can resist the story of your average joe becomming a celebrity by having his life filmed every minute of every day ? \nbut this average joe , ed perkuny , ( matthew mcconaughay ) , is a sappy , lifeless creation that wanders around , trying to solve everyone's problems and settle his own . \nmcconaughay is awful , especially because he is trying to pull off his usual hollywood charm with a 3 week beard and torn jeans . \nfrankly , he had more charm in the devestating flop the newton boys . \nhe overacts in every way : his overexaggerant body language , obsession with kissing women every second he gets the chance , and that cliched scene where he loses someone in his life , and drops to his knee and cries . \nthe rest of the cast is very good ; especially martin landau ( as ed's step-father ) , who plays a cute role as the close-to-death old guy that makes all the witty comments . \njenna elfman is good , ( but a little overemotional ) ; her main problem is that she keeps getting sucked into bad films , i . e . \ncan't hardly wait , and krippendorf's tribe . \nwoody harrelson , as ed's brother ray , does his usual egg-headed role , with his comic wit as well ( he wrote a book entitled , \" my brother pissed on me . \" ) \nelizabeth hurley is perfectly cast as the easy slut , and dennis hopper , in a quick cameo as ed's biological father , is a nice choice ( ironically coming after the role he turned down as christof in the truman show ) . \nellen degeneres stood out as the executive who , after awhile , decides the show must not go on much to the opposite of the head exec , rob reiner's opinion . \ni hate to compare this film to the truman show , but the fact is , i was ashamed to see this movie . \nit felt that i had dropped from college to kindergarten after seeing truman and ed . \nedtv had no real wit or genius ; it was typical hollywood . \nextracting the tv part of the movie , you have the simple plotline : man steals brother's girlfriend , girlfriend leaves town , man gets new slut girlfriend to feel like he can move on , slut breaks up with him , real girlfriend comes back , and voila , you have a romance . \ni got so restless during this movie , i almost walked out . \nthe only reason it doesn't drop below a \" c \" grade is because of the fine supporting performances . \nad2am \" i almost lost my nose . . . and \ni like it . \ni like breathing through it . \" \n-jack nicholson , chinatown \n", "five years after his directorial debut based on stephen king's writings called the shawshank redemption ( 9/10 ) , writer/director frank darabont returns to the big screen with another prison film based on the famous scribblings of stephen king . \nunlike the latter film , this one is a big , long , laborious bore . \nplot : a seven-foot death row inmate is discovered to have secret healing powers . \ncritique : this film is slow , drawn-out , boring , uninteresting , unexciting , predictable and topped with a couple of one-dimensional \" evil \" characters . \nits only positive attribute lies in its actors who all do credible jobs and its message of hope and belief in miracles . \nthe real miracle of my night was the fact that i did not fall asleep during this straightforward , unimpressive film about a guy with special powers who we never truly understand or care about . \nof course , much like all other death row cell blocks , this one is filled with decent inmates who all happen to be \" misunderstood \" , except for one cookie-cutter crazy guy who is evil personified . \nand let's not forget all the guards on death row , who also happen to be angels from the heaven above , except for one cookie-cutter crazy guard who is also evil personified ( and is there any reason why there are about six guards when there appears to be no more than three inmates ? ? ? ) . \nam i supposed to identify with anyone in this film ? \nor even more importantly , am i supposed to give a rat's ass about anyone in this film ? \nwell , if i was , i sure missed that boat , because the only thing that i ended up caring about during this entire picture was the obscene amount of fat that tom hanks has been able to burrow under his loose chin . \nfurthermore , there is absolutely no reason in the world why director frank darabont needed to take three hours and ten minutes out of anyone's life to present this story . \nin fact , the story is empty within itself . \ni truly did not get anything out of the film other than the fact that there is a guy on death row who has special powers to heal , and we are left wondering if he should still be executed or not . \nwow . \nhow interesting . \nthe plot's utter predictability is also at fault here with one guess as to whom is to get healed by the gentle monster in this film ( we are told that one certain lady has a tumor early on in the movie ) . \nwhip out those thinking caps , kids ! \nhmmm , and i wonder what will happen to those two cookie-cutter \" evil \" guys who have nothing in their system but hate and negativity . \nhmmmm , now think hard here , boys and girls . \nwhat a crock ! \ni am guessing that this film was supposed to be some three-hour exercise in spirituality , but unfortunately for me , it was neither spiritual or the least bit engaging . \nin fact , it was one big bore . \ni didn't see the point of the movie , i didn't see the point of the story and i certainly didn't see the point in tom hanks' big double-chin . \nall in all , a bad movie starring some great actors doing solid work , especially michael clarke duncan as the man of the hour , john coffey . \ngive that man an award or something ! \n", "synopsis : a small town thug convinces a dimwitted high-school student to spy on his girlfriend , who is babysitting three unruly kids for their alcoholic parents on a friday night . \nwhile this is going on , the thug , the father , the boyfriend , and a kid reaching the onset of puberty all have fantasies about the babysitter . \ncomments : to say this movie is bad would be quite an understatement . \ni'm not sure what writer and director ferland was hoping to accomplish with the babysitter . \nsuspense ? \nfamily drama ? \nhumor ? \nerotica ? \nelements of each of these genres exist in the film , yet it fails to successfully achieve any of them . \ninstead , the babysitter is a dull , lifeless movie which manages to bore and ultimately irritate its viewers . \ni suppose this film could have been watchable if it weren't for the fact that the characters are universally unappealing . \nalicia silverstone is completely wasted playing jennifer , the babysitter . \nher character has absolutely no depth at all , and her sole purpose in the movie is to be the object of the other characters' fantasies . \neveryone else in the film seems to be in a competition to see who can stoop to the lowest level by the time the film ends . \nthe parents are alcoholics who become increasingly obnoxious as the movie proceeds . \nthe father ( played by j . t . \nwalsh ) fantasizes about the babysitter ; the mother fantasizes about her husband's best friend . \nnone of these fantasy sequences , trust me , are things that need to be seen , but we see them anyway , complete with cheesy , make-out saxophone music . \nthe thug , in the meantime , proves that he's evil through his annoying habit of smashing half-empty beer bottles all of a sudden and for no apparent reason . \nthe most absurd character , however , is the babysitter's boyfriend who seems catatonically brain-dead . \nthe thug , in a manipulative , iago-like manner ( though he doesn't really need to try hard ) , manages to talk the boyfriend into binge-drinking , smoking grass , running away from cops , and playing peeping tom on his own girlfriend in a matter of minutes . \nincredible ! \n ( of course , the boyfriend's original plan for the evening was , try not to laugh , to sit in an empty diner and read catcher in the rye by j . d . salinger . ) \nif the goal of the babysitter was to be suspenseful , then it fails . \nthere are surprisingly few tense moments in this film , and nearly all of them come at the final minute . \nby that time , however , the audience is so tired of the inane characters that no one truthfully cares what happens to any of them . \nno suspense occurs in the dream sequences either because every single one of them is obviously a dream sequence from its inception . \nif the goal of the babysitter was to be humorous , then it also fails . \ni found nothing even remotely funny about the boozing parents who seemed , at times , to be played for laughs . \nif the goal of the babysitter was to be dramatic , then , once again , it fails . \nthe characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting . \nfinally , if the goal of the babysitter was to be titillating ( the type of film destined to be played ad infinitum on hbo at 2 in the morning ) , then it fails as well . \nthe dream sequences aren't erotic ; they are too brief and , outside of one very short scene , contain no nudity . \ni can't completely trash this movie . \nthe first 10 minutes or so vaguely resemble an interesting film , and the conclusion sports a halfway decent fistfight . \nthe other 79 minutes , though , are a drag . \nsilverstone's character , at the end of the movie , turns to her boyfriend and asks \" what were you thinking ? \" \ni asked myself the same question , having spent 99 cents renting this turkey . \n", "working in the motion picture industry must be a constant source of frustration for a front-line african american actress like jada pinkett smith . \ndespite being one of the freshest talents available , pinkett smith has often been relegated to playing thankless supporting parts ( a low down dirty shame , the nutty professor ) . \nthe problem is , of course , that there aren't many good roles available for black women . \ntake away the likes of waiting to exhale , set it off , soul food , and eve's bayou , and all that's left is a chance to be someone's girlfriend , a local whore , or a murder victim . \nas a result , for pinkett smith's first opportunity atop the marquee , she is stuck in a stupid , formulaic romantic comedy with the unpromising title of woo . \nactually , woo , the latest directorial effort from daisy v . s . \nmayer ( party girl ) , could have been worse than it is . \nthe film offers a few funny ( albeit juvenile ) moments and the on-screen relationship between pinkett smith's woo and tommy davidson's tim is appealing on those rare occasions when the two aren't forced to play it dumb for the sake of an endless barrage of cheap gags . \nunfortunately , huge portions of the movie are insulting to the intelligence of anyone with a triple-digit i . q . \nthe situations are painfully contrived , the main characters are lifted right out of sit-coms , and the supporting players are so incredibly stupid that i wondered whether they all participated in some kind of \" free lobotomy \" lab experiment . \nwoo is a spontaneous , energetic young woman who has been looking for love in all the wrong places . \nher latest relationship , with a testosterone-overdosed drug-dealer , came to an abrupt end when she refused to wear a beeper . \nnow , her transvestite/medium friend celestrial ( girlina ) predicts that she's about to meet mr . right , and that he'll be a virgo . \nlater that day , woo is given an opportunity to go out on a blind date with tim , a shy man with a penchant for neatness and order , who just happens to be a virgo . \nit's not love at first sight , however . \nthings get off to a rocky start when tim makes an awkward pass , and they get even worse when the pair arrives at a swanky restaurant to enjoy a \" quiet \" dinner . \nin the one-hundred year history of motion pictures , there have been a ton of bad \" white \" movies about mismatched lovers , so i suppose it's only fair that we get a \" black \" effort of the same low caliber . \nas in all romantic comedies , we know from the beginning that woo and tim are going to end up together . \nthe question is , are their courtship rituals entertaining ? \nin a good entry to the genre , the audience becomes caught up in the love story , no matter how familiar it is . \nin woo , the constant reliance upon unfunny , moronic humor sinks the project . \nfor those who enjoy spotting continuity gaffes , there's a huge one in woo involving a corvette with a broken window that miraculously repairs itself ( added to that is the mystery of how the car looses its top ) . \nsadly , that's one of the film's most enjoyable sequences , and the entertainment value is entirely unintentional . \ndespite exuding charm from every pore , there's little that pinkett smith and davidson can do to save their characters or david c . johnson's script . \nsince it misses the mark by so much , a better name for woo might have been whoops . \n", "there is a scene early in jakob the liar that hints at how much better it could have been . \nthe scene is set in a jewish ghetto in poland circa 1944 , where a one-time cafe proprietor named jakob heym is walking resolutely through the streets , fists stuffed into coat pockets . \nto one side of him , residents scavenge for food in the street ; to the other side , german troops beat a group of jews . \njakob , however , never stops moving . \nit's an efficient , effective set-up for the character , who is clearly nobody's idea of a hero at the outset . \nhe is a man who has responded to the horror of his surroundings by withdrawing from them , excising his moral peripheral vision . \nthe set-up is critical because fate will turn jakob into a reluctant savior . \nafter a visit to a german commandant's office and a moment alone with a turned-on radio , jakob learns that russian troops are quite near . \nwhen he brings this first news of the war in years to his fellow jews , they become convinced that he must have a radio , which is a punishable offense in the ghetto . \nthe good news brings hope to the ghetto ; the everyday specter of suicide vanishes . \na private man of limited creativity finds himself burdened with creating stories of russian military progress just to keep his neighbors alive . \nthis promising story of an ordinary person doing the extraordinary is burdened from the outset by casting : the \" ordinary person \" in question , jakob heym , is played by robin williams . \ni am of the depressing opinion that williams is growing less assured as an actor in his \" serious \" roles with every passing year . \ncompare his dramatic scenes in the world according to garp and moscow on the hudson with what dreams may come or patch adams , and see how much more mannered he has become ( or , at the very least , how much less sensible at choosing material ) . \njakob the liar depends on the notion that jakob has to struggle to craft his fictions , but williams always looks like he's struggling _not_ to craft them . \nwhen he improvises a radio address by winston churchill for ailing 10-year-old orphan lina ( hannah taylor gordon ) , he seems relieved that he can finally get wacky . \noh yes , and then there's that little girl . \nsome viewers will undoubtedly consider the hero's fanciful stories for a young charge too reminiscent of life is beautiful , but those scenes aren't problematic because they're familiar . \nthey're problematic because they're jarring and distracting , introducing a cutesy relationship into a film that shouldn't have been about cutesy relationships . \njakob's character arc may be about his willingness to act for the benefit of others , but there are plenty of others without poor little lina . \nevery scene with her feels contrived , pulling jakob the liar away from its central story of hope coming to a previously hopeless people . \nit is a pleasant surprise to find that jakob the liar is a much grittier production than you might expect from a hollywood-ized holocaust , combining the weighty subject matter with dark humor in some effective ways . \ndirector peter kassovitz , working from jurek becker's novel , crafts some nice scenes between jakob and the other townspeople , and draws solid performances from armin mueller-stahl ( as a once-revered doctor ) and bob balaban ( as a barber drifting into depression ) . \nthere are just too many things going on that prove distracting , whether it's the sketchy romanctic angle involving liev schreiber as an earnest former prizefighter , or williams' incongrous presence , or a sweet but utterly irrelevant little girl . \njakob the liar deals with too delicate a subject for such fumbling , and has too compelling a central character to waste . \nand after one wonderful early scene , you can see the film wasted and fumbled away . \n", "first troy beyer wrote the critically panned \" b . a . p . s . \" \nnow she makes her directorial debut , writing , directing , and starring in this sub-par film about women talking about sex . \nthough not without redeeming qualities , this film is bad . \nthe basic story follows three single friends -- jazz ( beyer ) , lena ( randi ingerman ) , and michelle ( paget brewster ) -- in their search for love . \njazz has an idea for a local talk show ; it would feature women talking about sex and dating . \nshe and her friends make a demo tape of interviews with the women of miami . \nthe film itself is sprinkled with these real interviews throughout , both as part of the plot and as commentary on the situations of the main characters . \nthe fact that they are real provides a refreshing break from some of the more melodramatic moments in the film . \nthere are several moments of bad acting , corny dialogue , and emotional overextension . \nin a low-budget independent film from a first-time director , these faults can sometimes be forgiven , if the screenplay is fresh and solid . \nthat is not the case here . \nthe script suffers from random plot developments . \nthere are four or five of these turns in the plot , each one raising the question \" where did that come from ? \" \nat one point , a character has a lifelong reconciliation with her mother . \nwe are supposed to be moved , but since the scene is completely un-led-up to , we really don't care if she and her mother get along . \nwe've never seen her mother before . \nwe never see her again . \nwho cares ? \nwhat's worse , these sudden developments are supposed to engage our sympathy . \nat another point , a character announces that she can't have children . \napparently , this is devastating . \nwe wouldn't know this because she never talked about having kids before , but we are nevertheless expected to be devastated for her . \nthe scene feels like an afterthought , its emotion manipulative and shallow . \nthese scenes grow worse and worse , culminating in an absurd climax . \ntwo scenes were played with such overwhelming melodrama that i found myself laughing . \none scene is a lover's spat between two minor characters . \nthe other has the main characters expressing their copious grief by cleaning house in wails of despair and clouds of ajax . \nthinking on these scenes , it is hard for me to admit that the film has redeeming qualities . \nbut it does . \nfirst , it is original . \nwe men often wonder what women talk about when they are alone in groups , and i imagine this film gives me a pretty good idea . \nit's something i don't think has been the subject of a film . \nsecond , the interviews of the miami women are sincere . \ntaken together , they form a mosaic picture of miami beachwalkers and bistro diners . \nthe mosaic is made of sound bites and stereotypes , but each tile is some woman's real experience . \nneither the picture of women , nor their picture of men , is truly representative , but the point is that both sets of generalizations are telling in their own way . \nat some level , the stereotypes that emerge can be called true . \ni can imagine some people liking this film when its characters talk about their \" likes , dislikes , skills , and thrills , \" but on the whole , it's pretty bad . \nand that makes it even harder to forgive the bad acting , corny dialogue , and emotional overextension . \ni'll give beyer one more strike , and then she's out . \nrated r ( almost got an nc-17 ) for explicit sexual dialogue and nudity . \n", "susan granger's review of \" mulholland drive \" ( universal focus ) \nwhatever david lynch is selling , i'm not buying . \nfrom the writer/director of \" blue velvet \" and \" twin peaks \" comes another dark , mysterious thriller that opens with an automobile accident on mulholland drive , the serpentine street that twists high in the hollywood hills . \ndazed , a beautiful brunette ( laura elena harring ) emerges and stumbles down a hill , slipping unobserved into a '30s-style apartment as the tenant leaves for a trip . \nthe next morning , a dewy blonde ( naomi watts ) from deep river , ontario , arrives in la with dreams of stardom in her suitcase . \nher aunt owns the apartment and the two women meet . \nthe brunette has amnesia so the blonde tries to help her discover her identity along with her latent lesbian lust . \nmeanwhile , a hotshot director ( justin theroux ) , whose wife is in bed with the poolman , is forced to cast a certain actress in his new film and there's an assassin ( mark pellegrino ) roaming the city . \nthe tortuous paths of these various characters - and others named cookie , coco and cowboy - intersect at various points but the plot remains elusive because , midway through the story , lynch has the brunette and blonde play two different women in an alternate reality , leaving a huge wad of cash , a blue metallic key , a paralyzed mogul and a lot of questions that go unanswered . \nelena harring and particularly naomi watts are gifted actresses , effectively making the subtle switch . \nthe same cannot be said for former m . g . m . \ndancer ann miller who's stiff and self-conscious , speaking - like most lynch players - in staccato tones . \non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" mulholland drive \" is a frenzied , frustrating 4 . originally designed as an episodic tv pilot , this surreal triumph of suspenseful style over substance is packaged as a puzzle with several of the key pieces left out . \n", "georges polti once wrote a paper called \" the thirty-six dramatic situations , \" in which he asserted the fact that all drama could be defined by no more than thirty-six different situations . \nthis may be the modern restatement of the biblical prophecy from ecclesiastes , \" there's nothing new under the sun . \" \nthe faculty , the latest movie by from dusk till dawn director robert rodriguez , certainly proves this in typical hollywood fashion . \nthere's not a measureable fraction of original material in this unworthy outing . \ndrawing elements from both the puppet masters and invasion of the body snatchers , screenwriter kevin williamson ( of scream 2 credit ) gives us a horror tale set in middle america ( ohio ) one eventful fall . \nmaking use of a cast of unusually stock characters , williamson designs an alien invasion that will not be done independence day-style but rather \" through the back door . \" \nparasitic aliens take over the faculty of a run-down high school and soon have infested most of the student body , leaving it up to the ensemble of principal characters to win the day . \nthe lack of gusto is the movie's major stumbling block . \neven though the genre has seen movies that have a lack for quality such as this , they've been saved by an energetic approach . \nthis casts more than a shadow of a doubt on williamson's ability , who enjoyed success with the wes craven-directed scream but couldn't pull anything solid in for this outing or i know what you did last summer . \nalthough he designs the faculty with more of a sci-fi bent than his typical slasher picture , it still comes down to the same results : throw the stock characters in a steel cage match and see who comes out alive . \non that level , the main roles are played by virtual unknowns . \nonly the recognizeable elijah wood ( deep impact ) is at the front ; other than that , the screen veterans are saved for the minor roles of the alien teachers . \nperhaps williamson has it in mind to champion these up-and-comers to the fame that their scream and last summer counterparts achieved ; but to do that , they'd all need to star in their own wb television show about the horrors of puberty a la \" dawson's creek . \" \nneedless to say the acting is far from top notch , nor does necessity ask that it should be . \nthere is a moment or two of genuine horror , but unfortunately williamson and rodriguez did not take the story far enough in the sci-fi direction to make any use of it . \nin sum , the faculty was just one long shot that did not pay off . \n", "the most popular trend of the last couple of years has been the twist ending . \nwatching one of these movies , everything seems to make sense until suddenly you are blown away by an unexpected surprise . \nwhen the film ends , there is a moment of confusion , then recollection , then some more confusion , then possibly a second viewing for clarification . \nthis is a description of an ideal twist that perfects everything it sets out to do and more . \ngood surprises make movies fun to watch . \nthen there are the bad twists . \nyou either know what is going to happen ten minutes into the movie ( i'm talking about you reindeer games ) or you did not guess the ending because it is so outrageously stupid . \nscrewed perfectly suits the latter description . \nwhat starts out as a dumb guilty pleasure which should be fun to mock with a group of friends ends with a complex finale with way too much going on . \nby the writers of man on the moon and the people vs . \nlarry flynt , scott alexander and larry karaszewski leave milos forman behind and take a stab at film directing . \nwhoops . \nscrewed is an inane christmas carol gone berserk with few genuine laughs and many acting embarrassments . \nnorm macdonald stars as willard filmore , a hard working chauffeur who just

( dave chapelle ) to kidnap crock's beloved dog and hold it for a ransom of one million dollars . \ntoo excited to pay any attention , the hapless losers' plan goes awry when the dog escapes and returns home . \nnow crock thinks willard has been kidnapped and the two friends , realizing they can make even more money , decide to stage the fake kidnapping . \nof course , everything that could go wrong does . \nthe first forty-five minutes of screwed is harmless entertainment - a guilty pleasure that should be enjoyably bad . \nbut the convoluted script eventually builds into a disaster that is impossible to bear . \nthe more idiotic these characters get , the more reckless the script becomes . \nat one point , i wanted to get out of my seat and yell at these characters : \" no , you idiot ! \" \ni'm not just talking about willard and rusty , who were extremely annoying , i'm also talking about the cops in this film . \na monkey could have solved this case within an hour but these guys ( headed by murder one's daniel benzali ) were just too clueless to forgive . \nthey give real cops bad names . \nalso poor danny devito apparently does not know how to turn down a role these days . \nlooking almost identical to his penguin in batman : returns , every time he appeared on the screen i had to shake my head in disbelief . \nhe just didn't belong in this movie . \nmacdonald and chapelle are veterans at these kinds of movies but devito made the film much worse than it already was , gross out humor is certainly not his forte . \nif you're a fan of norm macdonald's other chaotic comedy , dirty work , you might actually love this near-sequel . \notherwise , don't get screwed out of your hard-earned money . \n", " \" spice world \" is just one long promotional film for the british girl band the spice girls . \nsure there's a hint of humor in there every once in a while . \nactually , there's a couple of pretty good jabs at the spice girls . \nbut overall , who cares

movie ! \" \nthe supporting cast fares well . \nroger moore ( the real james bond ) mockingly plays the cliche-spewing \" chief \" of the spice girls , and darn it all , he's fun to watch . \nmark mckenney also is good as a screenwriter trying to pitch film ideas to the band's manager ( richard e . grant ) . \none question though : george wendt ? \nyou'd think that \" spice world \" would envoke one of two reactions in people . \nif you like the spice girls , you'll like them even more afterwards . \nand if you can't stand them ( like me ) , then \" spice world \" will really make you sick . \noddly , the audience i saw the film with , roughly 50 twelve year-old girls , sat in silence for the entire film . \nwell , not the two who sat directly behind me . \nthey kept muttering \" this is stupid \" over and over again . \nmaybe there is hope for humanity after all . \n[pg] \n", "i read the new yorker magazine and i enjoy some of their really in-depth articles about some incident . \nthey will take some incident like the investigation of a mysterious plane crash and tell you what happened in detail . \nit becomes a real education in what agencies get involved and how theories are suggested , and what kind of pressure the investigators are under , and just about any other aspect you can think of . \nfrequently i get the feeling that the article sounded exciting , but i am being told in more detail than i really wanted to know . \noften i get to the middle of a story and say , ok , it sounded good but i now have invested more time than i am willing to spend on this subject . \nfilm is a different medium . \nit is a visual medium . \nthat slows down the telling of stories much more than people realize . \ni frequently am surprised to find out how short a film script is and how much of the pages are empty space . \nthe magazine article and the film script are two very different media . \nthe insider is a film adaptation of the vanity fair article \" the man who knew too much \" by marie brenner . \nit is too much an adaptation of a magazine article slowed to the pace of a film . \nit really verges on being tedious at least at times . \nfor years the seven big companies knew that they dealt in an addictive drug that caused a host of unhealthy side-effects . \nbut they pretended for the public that it was unproven and they did not really believe it . \nthe business was incredibly profitable and the proceeds translated into the political power to squelch and discredit any political movements against big tobacco . \nthe tide turned when a former vice-president of one of the companies was convinced by the cbs 60 minutes news team to tell the public how much the tobacco companies really knew about the health effects of smoking . \nthe resulting pressure to stop the story created a small civil war at cbs . \nwho were the major people involved , what were their motives , how was the story almost killed , how did it get aired anyway ? \nthat is the story covered in surprising detail by the insider . \nthis all could have been enthralling , but it is not the sort of thing that a stylist like michael mann would be likely to do well . \nand in the end , he failed . \nto make a long story short , the film needed a director who knew how to make a long story short . \nthe film opens with the cbs 60 minutes team in iran with the assignment to interview a terrorist . \nwe get a taste for their personal style and how they get the upper hand . \nthey go from being one newsman blindfolded at the hands of the terrorists to the actual interview with mike wallace ( played by christopher plummer ) . \nthere the news team under producer lowell bergman ( al pacino ) are ordering around the terrorists and getting away with it . \nthis seems to have nothing to do with the main line of the story , but later when the tobacco industry is so much harder to manipulate than committed terrorists , we have a wry irony on who really has clout in the world . \nterrorists can grab the headlines , but the tobacco companies have the real position of power . \nincongruously intercut with the iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wigand ( russell crowe ) dejectedly returning from work to his home . \nwe discover that he has been fired and his career brought to a complete halt unexpectedly . \nhe had been a very profitably rewarded vice-president in charge or research and development at brown and williams tobacco ; now he was unemployed and needed money to support his family . \nrather than support him his wife liane ( diane venora ) demands of him what are they supposed to do for income . \nmeanwhile the 60 minutes team trying to do a story on fires started by cigarettes have obtained some data they do not understand . \nthey offer wigand $12 , 000 just to interpret the data . \nwigand's severance agreement swears him to secrecy about anything he knows about tobacco dealings , but he is reluctantly he stretches the severance terms . \nhe is willing to read some documents from another tobacco company and interpret them for bergman . \nin spite of the secrecy , wigand's former employers seem immediately to know wigand is talking to 60 minutes and he is warned off by former boss thomas sandefur played michael gambon in an all too brief but deliciously sinister role . \nand so the game begins . \nwigand is irate at his negative treatment for what he still considered continued to be loyalty to his agreement and his former employer . \nmeanwhile someone is playing very rough with wigand and his family . \nthe film examines wigand and the pressures placed on his family as they are caught between two powerful giants . \nwigand has always wanted to make tobacco safer and has natural sympathies with getting the story out . \nhe and his family are assaulted psychologically and financially by the giant tobacco industry that had never lost a legal fight . \nal pacino is given top billing but the wigand family is the core of the insider . \nthe story is told slowly and in just a bit too much meticulous detail . \nthe film is 157 minutes and is an extremely demanding film for the audience . \nthe musical score by pieter bourke , lisa gerrard , and graeme revell is one of the worst in recent memory . \nit puts ominous chords under some scenes and using voice in ways that become a distraction that gets in the way of the storytelling . \nalso disturbing is the casting of christopher plummer as mike wallace . \nplummer and wallace are such different types and wallace is too well-known for even so good an actor as plummer to play him convincingly . \nthis film might have been a really engaging experience under another director's control . \nmichael mann was the wrong person to helm this film and the insider lacks intensity because of his style . \ni rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n", "i should have known , damn it , i should have known . \newan mcgregor - codename : \" eye \" - is pointing a high-tech rifle-ly gadget at a fat , bald business-oriented american engaging in illicit sexual activities in a window across the street . \nwe get the requisite electro-green through-the-sight view . \nwe the audience , seeing a high tech rifle-ly gadget , of course think that eye is going to assassinate the target , but instead , he pulls the trigger and the rifle takes twenty or so hazy , low-quality photographs , which eye then proceeds to fax and e-mail to everyone in his target's office . \nall right , so thirty seconds in , i was slightly befuddled by this seemingly pointless rifle/camera , but i was still open minded . . . \nmaybe there's a really good reason for it . \ni've got reason to believe , you see - i admire a lot of ewan mcgregor's previous work . . . \nand he's obi wan ke- friggin-nobi for god's sake . \nand director stephan elliot's last movie priscilla , queen of the desert was a quirky little delight . \nthere's some genuine talent involved here . \ni think at the twenty minute mark , there was still a spark of hope in my heart . \neye has been assigned to investigate the leader of his organization's son ( i still have no idea what this organization was - british intelligence ? \nnational spy ring ? \nprivate investigation ? ) , who is apparently stealing from his trust fund . \nhe has received his assignment from k . d . \nlang , through an elaborate and expensive teleconferencing briefcase . \nwhen eye tracks his target to an expensive- looking secluded house , he witnesses a mysterious and beautiful woman ( ashley judd ) take a knife out and proceed to stab the poor bastard . \nok , that's odd , i think to myself , this could be interesting . \nthen she starts to cry , and through her tears exclaims \" merry christmas , dad ! \" \nfor the first time . \nso begins our tale of obsession . . . \nor . . . something . \nthe rest of the movie involves ewan mcgregor's eye character following ashley judd around to every corner of the united states , totally and completely obsessed by this woman from afar . \nthroughout his entire professional life , he has been a voyeur ; so when he falls for someone , the only way he can handle it is to watch and drool through telescopes and cameras . \nfine , that's a lovely premise , i suppose . \nbut gosh darn it , if you're going to go there , you better have some sort of explanation . \nand that's precisely where this film fails . \nthis is the kind of movie that pisses me off . \nit's an abortion , a collection of half-formed and wasted ideas that amounts to absolutely nothing in the end . \nit pretends it is something that it is not - a surreal and deep psychological character study wrapped in a high-tech thriller . \nhere , the filmmakers have confused \" surreal \" and \" deep \" with \" vaguely unclear \" and \" crammed full of insultingly obvious metaphors . \" \ni never , even for an instant , had the foggiest idea why eye would fall so in \" love \" with this woman who changes wigs and kills people . \nthe movie offers only two explanations , neither of which make a lick of sense . \nexplanation number one : the obnoxious presence of eye's imaginary daughter , who was taken away from him by his wife some time ago , tells him he shouldn't leave ms . judd . \nexplanation two , which by the end of the film has been beaten into our heads through imagery and dialog and even the title of the movie : \" beauty is in the eye of the beholder . \" \nwhoo hoo , that helps , thanks a bunch , case closed . \nthat's as deep as it gets , folks . \nthere is an attempt at an explanation in the final minutes , which , instead of tying everything together , ends up being as profound as a clever sixth-grade mad lib . \nthere are secondary characters that move in and out of the picture and serve little or no purpose except to make the audience wonder what the hell the point was . \nmy personal favorites include : the prison-matron modeled after austin powers' frau farbissina , who apparently taught ms . judd everything she knows about wearing wigs ; jason priestley's awfully played dirty desert vagrant #1 , who tries to emulate dennis hopper a la blue velvet , but fails miserably ; and the cop-who-sees-ashley-fleeing-an-accident-scene-and- then-wants-to-pay-for-sex- but-is-shot . \neach one in this sad little parade is a little more pointless than the last . \nthe script pays no attention to the laws of time and space . \nany time one of the frequent location changes occurs , the camera zooms in on a souvenir snow globe , and minutes , weeks , or years could have passed . \nbewilderingly inane stylistic decisions plague the whole affair - one character passes a glass of cognac to another in a slow-motion close-up awash in a lot of bass . \newan mcgregor at one point takes up residence in a bell tower just so he could be repeatedly awakened and deafened by the giant bell . \njason priestly starts philosophizing about sharks , then laughs maniacally . . . \ncut to random guy with eye patch . . . \niguana out of focus . . . \niguana comes into focus . \nwow , man . \nwhen i found out afterward that this film was based on a novel , it came as no surprise to me . \nthere are plenty of elements here that , if extended and fleshed out more , would have made for a decent story . \nand i wouldn't be surprised if i found out there was an hour and a half of footage cut from this movie lying in a landfill somewhere , or waiting in the wings for the dvd special director's cut . . . \nnot that anything would ever possess me to purchase such a thing to find out what i was missing . \nthe last ten or so minutes featured a conversation between the eye and the judd that was supposed to be some sort of revealing exposition . \nsome guy in the back of the theater was talking on his cell phone , and this time i didn't particularly care all that much because what was happening on the screen was a steaming pile of unholy crap ; the audience around me chuckled and whispered sentiments similar to what i was thinking . \nsomeone near cell-phone-guy did eventually yell , \" shut the hell up ! \" , but it was a lot funnier when we thought he was talking to the screen . \n", "as bad as \" mimic \" was , it definitly scared me . \n \" mimic \" continued the frightening hollywood trend of taking a foreign director who shows a lot of creative ingenuity and style , and completely flushing it when he comes to america to make a movie . \ndirector guillermo del toro was recently imported from mexico after he made the award winning and inventive horror film \" cronos . \" \nthat movie worked because it took an unconventional story , unique characters and well written plot and dialogue to create a truly scary movie . \nin \" mimic \" , del toro doesn't bother to give us anything original . \nthe plot is a stupid combination of \" aliens \" meets \" species \" meets \" jurassic park . \" \nthe characters have been recycled from a few hundred other movies . \nthere's nothing new in \" mimic \" . \nit's just a bunch of old tricks that rarely work . \nat the end of the movie , you're stuck wanting your money back . \nmaybe the worst thing about the movie is that del toro followed another annoying trend of recent movies : he forgot to turn the lights on . \ni don't understand why suspense movies lately have to follow the \" seven \" trend and be set in dark , dank areas . \nwatching \" mimic \" i was tempted several times to yell at the screen \" turn the lights on ! \nthe switch is to your right ! \nuse common sense ! \njust do it ! \nyou'll be able to see the monster in the corner ! \" \nthere's a scene where mira sorvino is standing in subway station while the lights are flickering on and off . \nit looked like the light operator was having a seizure , and sorvino didn't even notice - she just stood there looking like she was having deep thoughts . \n \" hmmm . . . . \ni think bean soup would be good for dinner tonight . \" \n \" mimic \" has a lot of incidental shock tactics ( boo ! \njust kidding ! ) and follows them up with the real scare , but nothing in this movie scares you . \nthe audience in the theater never jumped during suspenseful moments ; i think they were bored , too . \ni shouldn't blame del toro . \nhe isn't the first successful foreign director to come to hollywood and make a bad movie . \nhong kong director john woo made two of the best action films of all time , \" the killer \" and \" hard boiled \" then came to america to make the stupid \" broken arrow . \" \nfrench directors luc besson ( \" la femme nikita \" ) and george sluizer ( \" the vanishing \" ) followed woo's lead and made dumbed down versions of those movies . \nrobert rodriguez , who directed the terrific low budget \" el mariachi \" came to hollywood and directed the horrible , high-budget \" desperado . \" \ni don't know why a foreign director who shows such talent in his country can't make a good american movie . \nwoo finally broke through and made \" face/off \" , but it still isn't up to par with his earlier films . \ni get the feeling a hollywood producer sits in his office , chews on a big smelly cigar and says to the director , \" welcome to america ! \ni bet you must be tired after being on that boat for so long . \ndo you speak english ? \nnow , i know you think you've made good movies in the past , but now you're in america , so things are a little different here . \njust remember what the american audience always wants , and you'll be fine . \nthey want to see at least one big breasted woman , characters that they've seen a thousand times before ( because change scares americans ) , and you always need a cheesy feel-good ending to wrap things up . \nif you don't make that kind of movie , you'll be shining my shoes in no time . \" \n", "darren ( jason

silverman \" has its heart in the right place , but the story , by newcomers hank nelken and greg depaul , is too lightweight to sustain the tale of the battle for darren's soul . \nbased on their

while wayne and j . d . play cupid . \nthe boys even bring their idol , neil diamond , into the picture to help resolve things . \nthinking about it , this is a real mishmash of contrivance and coincidence that is held together solely by the comedic efforts of steve zahn and jack black . \nthe pair is able to elicit the film's only laughs with their goofy antics and child-like behavior . \nthey are relegated to providing slapstick guy humor and the two are more than equal to the task . \nsteve zahn has been steadily honing his comedic acting skills and gives some complexity to wayne , the \" brains \" of the gang . \njack black has the big-guy moves of a chris farley , giving j . d . an amusing physical presence . \nthe neat thing is that the two actors are able to get fresh laughs from stale material . \nthe rest of the cast doesn't fare as well , though . \njason biggs is the straight man of the musketeers and gets very little to do ; though having watched his previous films ( \" american pie \" and \" loser \" ) i'm not sure what attraction biggs actually has . \namanda peet is caustic as the manipulative judith . \nthere is no humanity at all to her character as she single-mindedly strives to recreate darren into her mind's image . \nshe's a monster that wayne and j . d . must defeat to save their friend . \nunfortunately , there is no dimension to her character

comedy with films like \" big daddy \" and \" beverly hills ninja , \" but falls flat with \" saving silverman . \" \nthe 2001 movie year has yet to provide us with a \" good \" film to sink our teeth into . \nat least , with \" saving silverman , \" we get a couple of funny perfs from zahn and black . \ntoo bad that the rest of the film lacks their level of humor . \nkick boxing deaths and

does not describe what goes on for most of the film . \nalessandro nivola plays robin fleming , a troubled , directionless 21-year-old who has a penchant for breaking storefront windows in a small town . \npolice sergeant phil quinn ( william sadler ) takes him in , and what ensues for the first 70 minutes is a tedious series of sneak-outs and sneak-ins where robin slips out of his jail cell , breaks a window , then returns , all without quinn ever noticing . \nalso added to the pointless proceedings is some would-be humorous shenanigans involving quinn's dimwitted deputy ernie attempting to engage in clandestine patrol car sex with his girlfriend donna ( karen sillas ) . \nwith a half hour ( if even that long ) remaining , director william ryan and writer john hughes ( yes , john hughes of '80s youth films and _home_alone_ ) finally approach something close to a point . \nturns out robin still pines for his high school sweetheart lise ( brooke langton ) , who has long gone on with her life , and hughes's main concern at long last reveals itself as a tired \" live in the present and for the future \" message . \nmost moviegoers , however , will likely be asleep by that time . \nwide awake , however , is the cast , who individually tackle their showcase dramatic scenes with energy and skill--thus revealing the _real_ purpose behind this listless enterprise : to serve as a series of acting exercises . \nsuch a glorified workshop may have its rewards for the actors , but it leaves audiences with a booby prize . \n ( opens october 16 ) \n", "vampire's is a rude ,

meantime , someone sends sarah rotting flowers , puts her name in the newspaper's obituary column , and kills her cat . \ncomments : never talk to strangers , a colossal waste of time , moves slower than molasses in winter to arrive at a conclusion which should be obvious to the audience 20 minutes into the film . \none wouldn't think that two genuine movie stars , antonio banderas ( evita ) and rebecca de mornay ( hand that rocks the cradle ) , and the acerbic comic genius dennis miller ( \" saturday night live \" ) would be involved in such a celluloid backfire as this turkey . \nnot only are they in it , however , but de mornay executive produced it . \nwhat was she thinking ? \nnever talk to strangers centers upon sarah , a psychologist examining the ill-tempered max , a murderer soon to stand trial . \nshe receives a sudden visit from her father which elicits flashbacks of some tragedy in her early childhood . \ntwo men woo her ; tony the \" security consultant \" wins her over ( so they have passionate sex replete with cheesy saxophone music ) . \na lot of psychobabble is thrown around about multiple personality disorder , but the movie asks its audience not to derive the obvious conclusion between mpd and sarah , and instead offers several male characters as red herrings . \n86 minutes , the running time of this cinematic mess , thus , seem like 86 hours . \na good chunk of never talk to strangers is spent upon sarah and tony . \nwhy would the career-minded , professional sarah feel attracted to the walking steroid with a black hat called tony ? \nthat's one of the film's mysteries which are never answered . \nregardless of motive , de mornay and banderas strip down and have sex several times in what passes for eroticism . \nthey also manage to go out before copulating occasionally -- in one of the stupidest scenes of the film , tony takes sarah to a carnival that's * right outside * his dingy apartment ( that way , they can hurry back and have sex quickly ) . \nalso , apparently , the weather changes quickly in their locale : they're at this outdoor carnival one day before having sex ; the next day , they're out playing in the snow before having sex . \nthe filmmakers attempt to produce a suspenseful plot interspersed with tony and sarah's \" character development . \" \nsomeone is out to get poor sarah ( though most of the audience should have figured out who before any of this starts ) . \nrotting flowers , a writeup in the obituary , and a beaten neighbor are just a few of the bad things which happen to her . \nsuspense cliche number one also occurs : whenever someone is stalked in thrillers , by any means , if the stalked has a pet , that pet will die . \noftentimes , to even further the cliche , the murdered pet is a cat ( suspense filmmakers , for some reason , just don't like cats ) . \nsarah , in never talk to strangers , receives a package and , lo and behold , discovers her mutilated cat within . \nsuspense at its very derivative ! \nas stated before , never talk to strangers is a poor excuse for a film whose sole purpose seems to be exploiting banderas and de mornay's bodies as often as possible . \ncomedian dennis miller is completely wasted here ( he's not given lines that are suitable for his persona ) and doesn't even appear all that much . \nmaybe , in a way , he's lucky for that . \nearly on in the movie , sarah tells tony , after meeting him in a supermarket , that she had been advised to never talk to strangers . \nallow me to advise that you never watch this stinker . \n", "a sensuous romantic comedy , about as appealing as your average lightweight tv sitcom . \nthere is no special ingredient on the menu for what is dished out , its the kind of stuff i've seen before and was made nauseous by its silly idea of love and what it thinks is funny . \nthe film plans to exploit the beauty and sweetness of its delicious star pen ? lope cruz , who plays a brazilian chef with a magical touch for bringing out the spices in her preparations , the aromas just sensually waft from her cooking pot , but who can't get by on looks alone in this transparently predictable story . \npen ? lope was wonderful in pedro almod ? var's \" all about my mother , \" but here she is so visible in such a stale story , where she can only smile and tease the audience by having us see a constant barrage of cleavage shots as she bends when cooking , that she somehow looks ridiculous , as if she got egg all over her face . \nthe best you can say about her , is that she's not to blame for this picture being so off . \nthis exploitation of sex film without even delivering nudity or sex , is in my opinion , worst than a raunchy film that delivers what it says it will . \nthe story is all about the love , motion sickness , and cooking ability of isabella ( cruz ) , who is born in bahia , brazil and learns to cook at an early age from her parents' cook . \nto cure her motion sickness , her parents tried every remedy , until they went to a spiritualist who prayed to the goddess of the sea for her cure . \nshe is able to control it now as long as she doesn't drive a car ,

problem -- unless she flew the plane . \nshe visits her friend's apartment monica ( harold perrineau jr . ) , who is a cross-dresser , blending right into the san francisco scene . \nto cast away her love for the irresistible toninho , she calls her spiritualist friend and gets her to cast an irreversible spell , freeing her from ever loving him again . \nher luck changes when a local tv producer cliff ( mark feurerstein ) gets a whiff of her cooking and storms into her cooking class as if were in a spell and presents her with her own live tv cooking show . \nyou can really write the script

freak , have isabella cook with tabasco instead of the brazilian peppers she uses , and they change her ethnic dresses to low-cut vanna white type of sexy dresses . \ncliff , her would-be boyfriend , acts creepy and sides with the network big-shots , even though he loved everything she did . \nthese tv scenes were not only bad stereotype scenes of tv honchos , they were revolting . \nit was an insult to one's intelligence . \ni'm sure that i'm not spoiling the ending for anyone , when i tell you that toninho reforms his macho ways and together they cook up a meal that breaks her spell of loving him again . \nif the film wasn't terrible enough , monica and cliff act on their attraction for each other and become lovers . \nit was so awkwardly done , that it had no sense of truth or humor to it . \nthis film might as well have been made by the same network guys featured in this film , because it doesn't look or feel like an almod ? var film , the type of film it aspired to be , but more like a film that was interferred with from above . \nits more like a futile commercial film that is more annoying than charming and more dull than chic , as it searches for box office heaven

discover in horror that jimmy king's real life is nothing like it is on wcw tv . \nking is a drunken atlanta native rather than an english king . \nafter convincing king that they don't care that his persona isn't real , gordie and sean sneak him back onto wcw monday nitro , after which sinclair agrees to book him in a main event steel cage match for the wcw title and his job back in las vegas at wcw's pay-per-view . \ngee , whiz , there are so many things wrong with this movie , i don't know where to begin . \nyes , i do . . . \n1 . the characters of gordie and sean show you what eric bischoff , wcw president who thought up this project , thinks of wrestling fans . \nhe thinks of us as idiots who take everything wrestlers do seriously . \nhe actually thinks wrestling fans are dumb enough to believe this is meant to be taken seriously . \ni got news for you , eric : nobody above the age of four is dumb enough for that , this is 2000 , you know , not 1985 ! \ni know he'll probably cover arguments up by saying it isn't meant to be taken seriously but it is , because that's how big an ego bischoff has . \n2 . there was a documentary made in 1998 , wrestling with shadows , that documented the owner of the world wrestling federation , vince mcmahon's screwing bret \" the hitman \" hart out of the title . \nthis movie's storyline is basically a comic rip-off of that plot with the poor man's wayne and garth thrown in . \neric bischoff is trying to make vince mcmahon look bad with the character of titus sinclair , but any wrestling fan knows titus is more like bischoff than mcmahon , and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart . \n3 . \nthe movie's main wrestler , jimmy king , has an english king gimmick and the audience cheered big for him . \nno wrestling fan actually enjoys characters like that in this day and age , we want bad asses today ! \n4 . why make this a comedy , instead of an emotional , rocky-style drama ? \ni know wrestling isn't a sport , but you can still get behind a guy who struggles as a wrestler and finally makes it in the end . \n5 . \nin the movie , gordie starts up an ill-fated romance with nitro girl sasha ( the lovely rose mcgowan . \nwhat she sees in that freak marilyn manson i'll never understand ) , only to find that she has hospitalized king's trainer for sinclair . \nwouldn't it have been easier to just have them fall in love instead of doing the typical spy-girl-for-the-bad-guy cliche ? \ni hate that . \n6 . \nlast , but certainly not least , there was not one single moment in this movie that i could not predict would happen , nor did i laugh once either . \nthe world wrestling federation should have been the wrestling company to make the movie , for these reasons : \n1 . they're the better promotion . \n2 . they have better and younger talent , performers and wrestlers . \n3 . \nthey give their fans what they want and don't treat them like idiots . \n4 . they're winning the ratings and they're the promotion everybody cares about . \n5 . simply put , they could make a movie a hundred times better , and they could do a wrestling movie the right way . \nthe only good thing about this movie was they played outtakes at the end . \nand if i spoiled it for you , good , i saved you from wasting seven dollars . \n", "battlefield long , boring and just plain stupid \nbattlefield earth \na film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman \nin my mid-teen years , i had a horrendous re-occurring nightmare . \nbehind the wheel of a car , i was driving down a straight road in the middle of a desert . \nno scenery except the horizon line and the converging parallel lines of the highway . \nno matter what i did , the view didn't change : travelling but not getting anywhere . \neach time i awoke in a sweat , terrified . \nyou don't have to be carl jung to understand that dream . \npowerless to make changes , trapped in a boring situation with no hope of rescue , this is the stuff of nightmares whether we are asleep or awake . \nthis is exactly how you will feel 15 minutes after \" battlefield earth \" begins . \nfor all of its flash and style , l . ron hubbard's science fiction epic is the earliest and best entry for the dullest summer film of 2000 . \ndull \" and \" stupid . \nin the year 3000 , the psychlo aliens have ruled our planet for 1 , 000 years . \nhumans either work as slave labor in mining operations or live as barbarians . \nthere's no hope . \nthe future is bleak . \nthen the psychlo make a mistake and capture feisty jonnie goodboy tyler ( barry pepper ) who organizes a revolution against chief of security terl ( john travolta ) and the alien race . \nit's an archetypal post-apocalyptic plot full of promise . \nconsidering some of the talent involved and all the millions thrown at the screen , it's difficult to see how it could have failed so miserably . \nbut it does . \nthe story is so full of holes that it falls apart within minutes of the opening credits . \nare we really supposed to believe that after a millennium of looking for gold , the psychlo never discovered fort knox ? \nor that fighter planes are still in pristine condition after all that time -- and gassed up ? \nor that the cavemen become such expert pilots in seven days that they can easily down the advanced alien ships ? \nor that the psychlo spy cameras somehow don't notice that their slaves are missing for days ? \ntravolta prances across the screen hamming it up for all he's worth and is almost entertaining . \nalmost . \nthe rest of the actors are wooden mannequins trying not to laugh while delivering lines that no person -- \" man-animal \" or not -- would ever utter . \nsome of the film _looks_ good , but it also looks so familiar . \na race of large hulking ape-like creatures has taken over the world while our cities lie in ruin . \nsound like something charlton heston might be in ? \nthe psychlo look like overweight klingons in gear from \" dune \" . \nthe final air battle between the air force fighters and the psychlo ships in their high-tech city is something george lucas might have been associated with . \nit's too loud . \nit's too oppressive . \nit's too slow . \nit's too long . . . far \ntoo long . \nand on it goes . \nthe list of the problems with \" battlefield earth \" is endless . \nit's difficult to find anything in the film that does work . \noh yeah . \nthe color scheme is nice . \nthe real question is how this movie ever got made . \ncould it have something to do with the fact that l . ron hubbard was the founder of scientology ? \nand that john travolta is a member of the church . \nthat might explain why travolta bought the rights to the novel years ago . \nbut it doesn't give us a clue as to why first-time screenwriter corey mandell's atrocious script was used . \nor why the high-profile project was entrusted with roger christian who had never before directed a major film . \nor why no one looked at this thing before it was released and realized there might be problems . \nthe one bright spot is that no longer will kevin costner's \" the postman \" ( which i begrudgingly admit as a guilty pleasure ) be \" the \" big budget science fiction failure . \n \" battlefield earth \" has the honor sewed up . \noften reviewers will recommend that you skip mediocre films and wait for the video . \nthat's not the case here . \nyou can act now and make the decision to not see it on the big screen or on the small one . \ndon't hesitate . \nstrike now while the iron is cold . \n", "hey , i've got a great idea for a movie ! \nok , here it is : we'll get tim allen to pull angry faces for about two hours or so ! \nwhat's that ? \nsounds too boring ? \nok , how about this then : we still have tim allen pull faces for about two hours , but half of them are angry looks and half of them are \" i'm in pain ! \" \nlooks ! \nwhat's that ? \nthat still doesn't sound funny to you ? \nhow about if we through in some \" ewwwww ! \" \nlooks ? \nstill not funny ? \nif you answered \" no , that doesn't sound funny \" , then ( ding ding ding ! ) \nyou're absolutely correct ! \nfor richer or poorer is a moronic farce about a rich married couple ( played by tim allen and kirstie alley ) who seek refuge in an amish community after their bumbling accountant ( wayne knight , best know as newman on tv's \" seinfeld \" ) gets them in trouble for tax evasion . \nwhat ensues is a badly scripted and horribly directed 114 minutes of cinema hell . \nwhat makes this all wrong is that nobody seems to have what the film needs . \n . \n . \nnamely , talent ! \nbacking up , the married couple is brad and caroline sexton ( allen and alley ) , a popular snobby duo who seem totally in love to everyone else , but in reality are on the brink of divorce . \njust as their marriage seems to be hanging from it's final thread , brad discovers that his accountant , bob lachman ( knight ) , has been engaging in illegitimate deals in the sexton's names . \nthe irs catches on , but since everything points back to the sexton's and not lachman , there is nothing much to do . \n . \n . \nexcept run away and join an amish community . \nfirst time screenwriters jana howington and steve lukanic give us a couple of chuckle-out-loud moments , and even some decent laughs here and * way * over there , but there is so much to cringe at in this horribly made film that you'll likely miss the laughs while regurgitating popcorn . \nalley is absolutely unwatchable , and the chemistry between her and allen is about as believable as my chemistry homework from tenth grade ( which , i inform you , was total b . s . ) . \nallen and alley are in no way convincing as tycoons , nor are they very convincing as an amish couple ! \nthis entire movie is one bad ill-conceived notion that should have been curtailed from the very beginning ! \nthe amish in this movie are also flimsy and unconvincing . \nit's such a trite , stereotypical script that i imagine the actors that were cast ( noticing that they're all predominantly tv figures ) were probably the only ones they could get ! \nbryan spicer's directing doesn't help one bit , either . \nin fact , listing spicer's filmography ( which includes the first \" power rangers \" movie and the big screen adaption of mchale's navy ) is more of an insult than a r ? sum ? ! \nnow that i've pretty much run for richer or poorer into the ground , i will let you in on the best thing about it . \nit bumped seven films up a notch on my \" worst of \" 1997 movie list . \nthat's right , thanks to this film ranking at number 3 for the year's worst , six films are now not seemingly as bad , and a smile like yours , previously inhabiting the number ten spot , now doesn't have to suffer the ridicule of making my bottom ten list . \nif you look at it in that respect , for richer or poorer will end up making someone happy after all ! \n", "even the best comic actor is at the mercy of his or her material , as this subpar submarine comedy proves . \ndown periscope stars kelsey \" frasier \" grammer as an inept navy captain who is given command of his own ship as part of a corrupt officer's ( james coburn ) plan to get him out of the navy . \nlike any lame emsemble comedy , the officer assigns him to a group of misfits like the guy who wants to be kicked out , the fat guy who eats all the time , the beautiful woman who doesn't belong there ( lauren holly ) , the second-in-command who does everything by the book ( rob schneider ) , the crazy old guy who freaks everyone out ( harry dean stanton ) and so on . \nthen comes the transparent plotline . \nfirst grammer has to fix up the delapidated korean war ship the navy has given him , and that comes courtesy a sad sight gag montage that includes a guy with a mop knocking schneider overboard . \nafter the ship is fixed up come the early drills , where everyone seems completely inept , like the electrician who can't connect wires so instead lets the current run through himself every time grammer gets on the phone . \nfinally , and this covers the final hour of the movie , grammer has to lead his men ( and holly ) to overcome the other ships in a wargames exercise . \nand he has to be a clever rebel to do it , in scenes that stretch all levels of believability . \nfirst they're singing \" louie louie \" like a bunch of drunk sailors to throw the radar of the other ship off , then thirty minutes later , they're making whale mating noises to throw the radar of the other ship off . \nthe whole while , evil captain coburn is overacting underwater , cursing grammer ( as most people watching the movie probably are too ) . \nit's all predictable without any original humor to redeem it . \nthe jokes are right out of \" mchale's navy \" and other cut-rate sitcoms of the past . \nthere's one scene where schneider looks through the ship's pantry in disgust , holds one food can up and announces , \" this expired in 1966 ! \" \ni yelled back at the screen , \" so did these jokes . \" \ni watched this movie with the whole family and everyone hated it . \nmy mom was so bored she brought out the coupon book midway through and , around the start of the second hour , i started writing my will . \nthe blame can't really be placed on the stars , though . \nkelsey grammer is good in this , he just doesn't have anything to work with . \nhis character is said to have gotten so drunk one night that he had \" welcome aboard \" tatooed on his penis . \ngrammer probably did something even worse -- got really drunk and agreed to appear in a movie he knew nothing about . \nsame for holley ( save the penis part ) , who is likeable in down periscope just because she's so gorgeous . \nas for schneider ( whose character is downright annoying ) , there was nowhere to go but up after surf ninjas , although he's still in the depths of the comedy ocean after jumping the \" snl \" ship . \nmy theory is that down periscope is one of those movies that got the green light before the script was even written as a formula comedy ( \" okay , it's police academy in the navy with frasier at the helm and the chick from dumb and dumber . \" ) and after everyone was signed on turned into a disaster . \njudging from the video box , most other movie critics agree with me . \nthe only quote the down periscope copy writers could dig up came from the prevue channel's jim ferguson . \ni guess even jeff craig from \" 60 second preview \" ( who said tank girl \" kicks butt ! \" \nwithout ever seeing it ) didn't like this . \n", "movies don't come much more ridiculously titled than \" i still know what you did last summer , \" but since the movie in question is best described as ridiculous , the title sort of works as a warning . \nmore than a silly-sounding mouthful to blurt out to the ticket vendor , this horror sequel's moniker also contains a grievous oversight that anyone who saw the original will be able to spot : what \" you \" did _last_ summer \" you \" actually did the summer _before_ last summer , and since \" i \" knew about it _this_ summer as well as _last_ summer , it's really illogical to say that \" i \" _still_ know what \" you \" did _last_ summer . \nthe filmmakers would have at least made sense with the shorter \" i still know , \" the longer \" i still know what you did two summers ago \" or the appropriate \" stupid people getting hacked to bits . \" \nthat last suggestion is the preferable one since the characters in this film do things that are the polar opposite of smart . \nfor example , if your roommate is plagued by terrible nightmares as a result of being stalked and nearly murdered not long ago , would you sneak into her room late at night and hide in the closet , even if it was just to locate and borrow a cute little dress ? \nprobably not , but that's precisely what college student karla ( pop diva brandy ) does to best friend julie ( jennifer love hewitt ) , resulting in the first in a long line of phony frights . \njulie , you'll recall , was one of the sole survivors at the end of 1997's surprise hit \" i know what you did last summer , \" after a slasher with a grudge to bear - it's a _long_ story - began trying to pick off her , her buddies and various others in their coastal carolina village . \nin this installment , the plot picks up as karla wins a trip to the bahamas , and julie , yet racked by guilt , decides that maybe a tropical getaway will help ease her mind . \nyeah , right . \ntheir island paradise has room , of course , for one more in the form of the still-alive killer ( muse watson ) from the first film . \nhe sports the same gorton's fisherman get-up , a heavy hat and rain slicker that mask his identity , but why he's still trying to stay anonymous is a mystery this movie never solves . . . \nthough i suppose his hook-hand would look funny protruding from the sleeve of a leisure suit . \nin a sense , that's the movie's glaring flaw - everybody knows who the bad guy is , thus evaporating the level of paranoid tension nicely sustained by its prequel . \nthe murders and attempted murders in that film were vivid and scary , but trey callaway's derivative \" i still know \" screenplay makes the fisherman just as dumb as his pretty potential victims . \nwhen julie lays blissfully unaware in a tanning bed , giving him a perfect chance to wreak vengeance once and for all , what does he do ? \nhe twist-ties the lid shut and cranks up the uv rays - you'd think he'd want her gutted now instead of a skin cancer victim later . \neven prequel \" summer \" lovers might balk at how little there is here beyond sporadically amusing absurdity and a few neat-o shots of blood flowing from toned teenage flesh . \nthe innovative gallows humor that scribe ( and \" scream \" wunderkind ) kevin williamson injected into \" i know \" 's unfolding story is sorely missed , replaced with the grating antics of a white rastafarian cabana boy who smokes weed and tosses off slang like \" yo \" ; you'll cheer - not shriek - when he ends up with a pair of hedgetrimmers firmly implanted in his chest . \nif \" i know what you did last summer , \" however effective , was just the kind of movie that those subversive \" scream \" flicks poked fun at , then the deadly \" i still know what you did last summer \" deserves a full-blown roasting on \" mystery science theatre 3000 . \" \n", "synopsis : a humorless police officer's life changes when he befriends a super-smart , super-adorable golden retriever named einstein and a cute , young blond scientist . \nunfortunately , einstein shares a psychic link with a bigfoot-sized ape-creature trained by the blond scientist to be an unstoppable killing machine , and this rogaine-nightmare is loose and after the dog and the girl . \nmeanwhile , a group of white , chain-smoking , gun-toting nsa agents in sunglasses and business suits tries to kill all the other characters in the movie . \ncomments : watchers reborn , a cheaply made direct-to-video turkey , is the fourth sequel to the first film version of dean koontz's bestselling novel watchers . \ntechnically , this should have been called watchers v , but it seems that this cycle of horror movies , much like many other sequel-crazy film series , has decided to drop the numbers from the titles . \n ( even the star trek movies dropped the numbers from their titles after star trek vi . ) \nthe makers of watchers reborn probably want to fool unsuspecting video rental customers into thinking this might be a good movie instead of a crappy fifth installment of a film series which should have died a long time ago . \nthis really isn't a good movie . \nhave you ever rented a movie and recieved a sinking feeling about it when you watched the previews preceding the feature presentation ? \nwell , any hope a viewer may have had , perhaps because he is a fan of novelist dean koontz or actor mark hamill , will be dashed by the time he's seen the trailers tagged on before the beginning of watchers reborn . \nthey're awful . \nthese commercials cover films like a strange stripper movie called shadow dancer , some weird crap about a dead indian , teens , and wolves , and an \" action \" movie called detonator starring scott baio . \nscott baio ! \nwhat idiot dreamed this movie up ? \nafter surviving these abysmal trailers , the person finally gets to watch the movie he rented : watchers reborn . \n \" maybe it won't be * that * bad \" he may say to himself . \n \" perhaps , just perhaps , the bottom-of-the-barrel film fluff advertised before it is greatly misleading . \nwatchers reborn , after all , is based on that cool book dean koontz wrote a decade ago . \nit stars mark hamill -- luke skywalker himself from that terrific star wars trilogy . \nlou rawls is even in the mix ! \" \nunfortunately , the force is certainly no longer with mark hamill ( he looks very sick here ) , and this movie shares only basic plot elements with watchers , the book . \nthe latter is really too bad . \nkoontz is a hack writer producing way too many thrillers for his own good , but he is still my favorite hack writer . \nkoontz has a writing style which is succinct and suspenseful . \npeople who read many of his books , however , often complain of repetitive plot devices . \nit's definately not a koontz book if there isn't ( 1 ) a psychic , ( 2 ) a super-intelligent dog , or ( 3 ) a psychotic killer who likes ripping out people's eyeballs . \nwatchers has all three devices , which may explain why it's arguably the most popular of koontz's books . \nthe idea behind koontz's novel , though highly implausible , is very interesting . \nbasically , a biological war machine is created : a smart dog can be released in battle , track down its target , and then relay the target's position , psychically , to a large creature designed to kill in hand-to-hand combat . \nsilly but kind of neat too . \ni'm sorry . \ni don't mean to ramble on about matters not directly linked to watchers reborn , the movie . \ni suppose i just don't want to talk about the movie itself . \nthis turkey is really cheesy . \nno one in this movie can act , including mark hamill , and it's difficult seeing the aged luke skywalker stumble around trying to be the hero . \nthe cheese factor is only increased when he's involved in an implied sex scene with the blond biologist / geneticist / zoologist / whatever-the-f * * k-she's-supposed-to-be whom he befriends . \nmercifully , the filmmakers opted not to do nudity . \nto be honest , the only half-convincing actor in the film is the golden retriever who plays einstein . \nyou know a movie is bad when a dog outacts all of its human counterparts . \ni find it difficult to relate how laughable the action sequences are in this movie . \nand the creature ! \nyes , the creature out after poor einstein is some guy in a furry suit and a mask which poorly imitates the werewolves in the howling . \nthis creature is shot about 500 , 000 times , but it's okay . \nthe creature has the ability to kill people by swinging his arms around and pushing . \noh , he can also rip body parts off , allowing for many scenes of fake hands and arms being thrown around . \ncheesy gore . \nthat's another main element of watchers reborn . \nit has many bloody scenes which are thoroughly unconvincing and only increase the film's campiness rather than its suspense . \nultimately , i gave watchers reborn a star and a half because bad horror / sci-fi film buffs may get a few kicks out of the film's silliness ( though this film will tax even their patience -- it's an 83 minute film , but it feels like four hours ) . \nalso , i hate to admit , i have survived far worse than this . \nanyone who has sat through the christopher lambert and natasha henstridge debacle known as adrenalin : fear the rush will know what i mean . \nfinally , i couldn't help but think that watchers reborn would work well as \" bot fodder \" for the creative folks behind one of my all-time favorite shows , \" mystery science theater 3000 . \" \nthis thought alone helped me survive watchers reborn with a smile on my face . \nrated r , watchers reborn contains dozens of blood-spattered bodies and unconvincing gore . \nit also has violence , obviously . \ni wouldn't recommend it for the little kids , but i'm sure even young teens would make it through this movie okay . \ninstead of watching this film , however , i recommend reading koontz's book . \ntrust me , it'll be time much , much better spent . \n", "you should have heard the old guys in the crowded bathroom following the \" odd couple ii \" sneak preview . \nthey were as happy a group of men as i've ever encountered . \n \" what a great movie , \" exclaimed one gent at the urinal , \" everything was so true ! \" \n \" yeah , \" laughed a man standing next to him , \" i drive as slow as that one guy did . \nmy kids give me holy hell for it ! \" \n \" and peeing is a big part of my day , just like with felix , \" chuckled another fellow , as he fastened his trousers up around his nipples and prepared to rejoin his wife . \nif you're over 60 and in the habit of driving at least 20 miles per hour below the posted speed limit , \" neil simon's the odd couple ii \" may be just the film for you . \nothers will likely be less charitable . \nwhile \" the odd couple ii \" is amiable enough , neil simon's shockingly lazy screenplay feels like a slapped-together tv reunion show , suffering from wheezing situation comedy set-ups and jokes straight out of the borscht-belt . \nsimon , once the toast of broadway , has apparently shifted his sights from the great white way to the neighborhood multiplex in branson , missouri . \nthe contrived story , involving the marriage of their kids , provides the excuse for a reunion between oscar madison and felix unger , who haven't seen each other in 17 years . \nthe former roommates fly into california from their respective homes for the wedding and , quite literally , run into one another at the airport . \nthey take off in a rental car for the ceremony in san molina , get lost and have a series of \" wacky \" adventures on the road . \njack lemmon and walter matthau reprise their roles as felix the neat freak and oscar the slob . \nwhile there is an undeniable chemistry between the pair , the impact of their reunion is lessened by the fact that they've headlined three films together since 1993 : \" grumpy old men , \" \" grumpier old men \" and \" out to sea . \" \nstill , the two veteran actors are fun to watch . \nmatthau , whose magnificently rumpled face looks like a big pile of laundry with eyes , has a field day as oscar , the crown prince of the curmudgeons . \nlemmon , looking pastier than usual , is fine as the ever- annoying felix , who still punctuates his chronic whining with occasional allergic honks of \" phnah ! \nphnah ! \" \ndespite their bickering , the characters have real affection for each other , providing a welcome respite from the non-stop barrage of insults that marked their previous three films together . \nunfortunately , matthau and lemmon's charm isn't enough to compensate for simon's hack script , which wouldn't pass muster even on a upn sitcom . \none contrived situation follows another , lathered with enough stale one- liners to supply a dozen would-be comics on open-mike night at the local comedy club . \nif someone drags you to this film and you find yourself as bored as i was , try entertaining yourself by counting the product placements . \nburger king gets one , as does the el pollo loco taco joint , but budget rent-a- car really hits the jackpot . \nbetween script references to their business and shots of signs and stickers bearing their company name , i couldn't keep count of all the plugs . \ni did , however , keep track of some of the swearing . \ni came up with four \" god-damns , \" three \" shitheads \" and two \" fucks . \" \nthe inclusion of those particular profanities seemed odd for a film aimed at an older audience , but the theater full of seniors appeared to have no problem with them , howling like crazy every time the boys let rip with a naughty word . \nit's sad that a writer of neil simon's stature has grown desperate enough to resort to swearing for cheap laughs , but not surprising when you look at what else gets passed off as humor in this tepid exercise . \none running gag involves oscar and felix's inability to remember the name of the town where the wedding is to be held . \nat one point , the men actually spend 30 seconds just free-associating , riffing off variants of the word \" san . \" \nthe sequence is so creatively bankrupt that it is simply embarrassing . \none of the oldest maxims of film-going is \" beware of movies that use the author's name in the title . \" \n \" neil simon's the odd couple ii \" is no exception to the rule . \nwhile the production has enough minor pleasures to warrant a tv viewing on some lazy sunday afternoon , it has no business playing in a movie theater . \nof course , there's a bathroom full of old guys who would strongly disagree with every word i've written , and would probably whip my \" young-whippersnapper \" ass to boot . \none thing's for sure , though . \nthey'll never catch me in a car chase . \n", "the army comedy genre has never turned out a truly good movie ( if you don't count neil simon's biloxi blues ) . \nyear after year , more predictably cliched military movies come out -- most recently sgt . \nbilko -- and none of them ever manage to be anything more than a rehash of the last . \ni thought stripes would be different . \nwith ivan reitman as director , bill murray as star and harold ramis as co-star and co-screenwriter , it seemed like it would be ghostbusters in the army . \ninstead , it was a bunch of unfunny crap in the army . \nmurray , about as funny and sophisticated here as he was in meatballs , plays a loser cab driver who sees the army as his only chance for success , and convinces his friend ramis to enlist with him . \nso he does , and we get the obligatory drill sergeant from hell , head-shaving and marching/singing sequences , more mind-numbingly stale here than ever . \nthe characters are even less original , ranging from underachieving slob john candy to incompetent captain john larroquette . \nall the big name stars in stripes ( and even larroquette ) fall victim to the lame , rehashed material and are never really likeable , murray in particular . \nhe only gets a few decent lines in , although those barely-funny one liners pale in comparison to the hilarious peter venkman character he played three years later in ghostbusters . \nhe was even better in caddyshack , for crying out loud . \nas with a lot of the late 70's / early 80's comedies , stripes is a completely juvenile movie only a child would like but is so sex- obsessed no child should be able to watch it . \ni'm sure it seems funny on paper to have candy pay over $400 to mud wrestle five beautiful women , but while watching it all that was coming out of my mouth was the admonition \" dear god ! \" \nevery few seconds . \nstripes isn't the playful kind of sex comedy , either . \nmost of the time it seems downright misogynistic , as when larroquette uses his telescope to peer into the women's showers or murray lifts a female m . p . \nonto the stove and , with an i-know-what-you-like look on his face , says he's going to give her the \" aunt jemima treatment , \" which means shoving a spatula under her butt repeatedly . \nyou don't want to stick around as the scene progresses and he uses an ice cream scoop on her genital region . \n \" i'm not enjoying this , \" the woman protests . \nmy sentiments exactly . \n", " \" mercury rising \" has numerous flaws , but there is one that really stands out : its central plot device is unnecessary . \nthat's right . \nthe major aspect of the film , that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy / action flicks could be dropped from the beginning , and the movie would turn out exactly the same , if not better . \nthis central device is the fact that a nine-year-old boy is autistic . \nhis name is simon , and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it . \nsimon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film , and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent , unfair world against his will , with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him . \nthe fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of \" mercury rising . \" \ni suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon's character and his relationship with willis , but here it is lost . \nmiko hughes , the young actor who plays simon , goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic : he walks slowly , drawls his words , kicks and screams when he's touched , and has a hard time looking at other people . \nit's a difficult role for an adult , much less a young child , to play , and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isn't playing like he's autistic . \nunlike dustin hoffman's performance in \" rain man \" or leonardo dicaprio's in \" what's eating gilbert grape , \" we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting . \nhowever , unlike \" rain man \" which used its character's autism in unique and interesting ways to build a credible and touching story , \" mercury rising \" could go right about its generic , predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart but really shy kid . \nhell , he doesn't even have to be shy . \nin fact , the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role , rather than just being carted around under willis' arm . \nwillis' character , art jeffries , is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything . \nhe becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simon's house , where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide . \nof course , we know that isn't the way it happened happen because we saw an evil , square-jawed government hitman with a mean-looking crew-cut knock off the parents . \nsimon was able to get away , and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet , which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked . \njeffries -- who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it -- knows there is something more , and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon . \nthis is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simon's parents is crawling everywhere , attempting to kill simon at the hospital , on the highway , and every other place he goes . \nlate in the movie , jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named stacey ( kim dickens ) who he meets at a coffee shop . \nof all the hard-to-believe aspects of the movie , this is the worst . \ni can believe in the decency of the human heart , but stacey's character is far too accommodating . \nnot only does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery , she lets him into her apartment at two o'clock in the morning when she knows the police is after him , and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent . \nthe grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point . \nthe movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences , but even here \" mercury rising \" doesn't rise to the challenge . \nthe movie was directed by harold becker , who has made some good suspense films including \" sea of love \" ( 1989 ) and \" malice \" ( 1993 ) , but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion . \nthere is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries and another hitman ( played by peter stormare ) that is so ineptly directed , shot and edited , that i had no idea 1 ) exactly where they were on the streetcar , 2 ) who was hitting who , and 3 ) where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were . \nthe grand finale takes place on the roof of a tall building , and features a harrowing ( yawn ) scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building , not because he has to , but because it's more suspenseful that way . \ntaken as a whole , \" mercury rising \" is an tepid , confused movie that lacks style , wit , and any traces of a sense of humor . \nusually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles , but here he is too straight and serious . \nthis is because the movie wants to be an action flick and a heartfelt drama at the same time , but it ends up failing on both fronts . \nmaybe the book was better , but the way it's handled here is a perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore . \n", "i have never been a \" star trek \" fan , and , to tell the truth , out of the five films in the series that i have seen ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 8 , 9 ) , i have disliked all of them . \ni do , however , always go into one of these with an open mind , and the ninth film in the series , \" star trek : insurrection , \" is no exception . \ndropping almost completely the hard-core sci-fi element of the previous one in the series , \" first contact , \" \" insurrection , \" tells the story of a planet that holds only 600 people , known as the ba'ku , as well as the fountain of youth . \nat the start of the picture , the villagers go under attack by a second alien species , known as the son'a , who want to push all of the ba'ku out so that their own race will not die out . \nalso attacking the ba'ku is data ( brent spiner ) , a robot from the star trek enterprise . \nafter returning to jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the gang on their space ship , no one can understand why data was somehow taken over by another force . \nso several of the star trek members travel down to the planet of the ba'ku , where picard meets up and starts to fall in love with one of the inhabitants , a sultry , kind alien woman ( donna murphy ) , who is over six-hundred-years-old , but looks to only be in her thirties . \n \" star trek : insurrection , \" is a completely unoriginal and cheap-looking installment in the series , and is a big step down from , 1996's \" first contact , \" which at least appeared to try to make something a bit different . \nin , \" insurrection , \" however , it plays like a low-rent episode of the television show , due to the small-scale , generic storyline , and an emphasis on one-liners rather than excitement . \nthe film was filled with nearly non-stop comedy , and worse yet , most of it fell flatter than a cartoon character that drops off a cliff . \nmeanwhile , when there were action sequences , they were not at all interesting or inventive , relying on that old reliable ticking timer that counts down very , very slowly . \nthis plot device , which is seen in just about every action film made nowadays , is getting old fast . \nare filmmakers so bankrupt of ingenuity and ideas that they must always have a timer ticking away during the climax ? \nanother element of , \" star trek , \" films in general is that picard seems to always have to have a love interest , but then she always miraculously disappears when the next film is made two or three years later . \nalthough donna murphy , who falls victim to this thankless love interest role here , is actually one of the few characters that we get to know in the 103-minute running time , alfre woodard was far superior in , \" first contact . \" \nshe should have returned for this one , but i don't blame her for not wanting to waste her time with this movie's disappointing and often lifeless screenplay , by michael piller . \n \" star trek : insurrection , \" is perhaps the weakest film in the \" star trek , \" series , although i have not seen what is widely considered the worst , \" star trek v : the final frontier . \" \n \" insurrection , \" is the type of \" safe \" sequel that will bewilder non-fans , since it is so low-tech compared to most of today's blockbuster action films ( although most of these are honestly not very good , either ) , and should disappoint the loyal trekkies , since it could have easily been better if the makers had realized that the screenplay needed to go through a few more drafts . \non second thought , they probably should have completely thrown the script out . \nthat way , they could have come up with a story that at least had a sign of intelligence and freshness . \n", "while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation , we had yet another shoddy , subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks . \nand , once again , we have one of the worst films of the year . \nthe trend of the moment-- and bear in mind it's a trend not a movie - is spawn , and if you've seen the animated series on hbo you'll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man , an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment : he's been sent to hell . \ntodd mcfarlane , the creator of the spawn comic book , must have had a tough time sitting through spawn , for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects , style over substance , ambience over anything else . \nnot only does spawn rely entirely on special effects , the story , about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of * bad guys * and * find himself * in the process is realized in such a sordid , incapable manner , it becomes indigestible after a while . \nevery character in this film is lifeless , vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student . \nthe story begins , like in every superhero movie in this age , with a man living an idyllic life . \nal simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government agent/assassin shares the love of his wife , wanda ( theresa russell ) and daughter , has a tongue-in-cheek , wiseass partner , terry ( d . b sweeney ) and is content with the job his boss , jason wynn ( martin sheen ) , provides him . \nthe next element in the film is the part when things go awry . \nand as expected , everyone turns the tables on poor al . \nas the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant , al is befriended by jason , and dies in a gory and truly sickening scene . \ninevitably , it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away . \nhence , jason's mischievous master-mind plan , to ` conquer the world \" is just commencing its initial stages , when al makes a pact with satan himself , agreeing to command the devil's army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again . \nso , our pal al has been uplifted to hell , and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place , his ol' partner terry forms a relationship with his wife . \ntime passes . \nand now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city , the ghetto where cog ( nicol williamson ) teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts , his motorbike , armor , etc . . . \nthis character is merely a poor man's obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla . \nnow the stage is set spawn , the new `enemy of evil' vs evil . \nand evil takes the cake , doubtlessly . \njohn leguizamo's deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the film's relief point . \nall this anguish , pain , half-baked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo , who steals the show and derives joy from his character , which is basically a compilation of so-so one liners . \nand then there's martin sheen . \nwhichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years . \nhis selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent . \nas the megalomaniac boss , his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a b-movie , scrambled , and left in the shelf to rot . \nthis is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street . \ni'd never thought i'd be saying this , but at this juncture , charlie sheen's career is in better shape . \nspawn is a movie in which realism , or even an attempt to draw a parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable . \nfor most of the film the vapid michael jai white consumes his time ogling , jumping through roofs , and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman and robin accomplished better . \nit constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie-- a very bad superhero movie . \ncontinually the film kept on depending on special effects , and sadly , this is how pictures are being made . \nperhaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry . \nthe filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible . \nthe quality of this film is abysmal and insulting . \nit is perceptible that director mark dippe , attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burton's batman did touch , the desperation of a man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act . \nbut bruce wayne had human elements to him . \nhe was pensive , resourceful and had relationships , which made our perspective on him equally human . \nthe character of al simmons seems to be longing for a drastic change , as if he's fatigued about being normal . \nand as all superheroes , batman , superman , the phantom , they must possess an element of normal civilians to make us think they are extraordinary . \nnone of this is present in spawn . \nthe fighting sequences are weakly executed , the dialogue is penny-dreadful and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runner's . \nas an example of this film's vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn decided to include a poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten , and then rescued by spawn , so our emotions tend to be a little more sympathetic . \nadmittedly , i did laugh once in the film , and that's when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum . \nit is no wonder why so american children grow up with no engrossment for art or literature . \nbesides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system , i condemn the other part to garbage like spawn . \nmovies that present no admiration , no captivation , no richness and vague interest in what children are being subjected to . \nand kids will continue to see films like spawn , simply because they are unable to differentiate what makes an imaginative , wondrous film from an insipid and wasteful one . \nchildren are not muppets . \nand spawn unapologetically targets children . \n", "it's not a bad thing to update old stories . \nit's done all the time in the oral tradition . \nthe difficulty with this film is not that the tale has changed , it's that it's dry . \nthe new cinderella , danielle ( drew barrymore ) is not sitting around waiting for her prince to come . \nshe's a woman of the late twentieth century albeit situated in sixteenth century france . \nwhen her father dies , she stays on in his house even though she is mistreated by her wicked stepmother rodmilla ( anjelica huston ) . \nshe works by day , but reads sir thomas more by firelight at night . \nalthough the story is updated , you know the plot . \ndanielle meets prince henry ( dougray scott ) , goes to a ball disguised , is later found out and they live happily ever after . \nthe movie is often like watching a filmed play . \ntheater in real life is engrossing . \ntheater on the screen is usually lifeless . \nthere doesn't seem to be much going on . \nthe camera can be a star of films . \nhere it's a co-conspirator . \ndanielle's convictions are compromised . \na socialist and a feminist , she pretends to be royalty to get her man . \na kind woman , her last act in the movie is one of revenge . \nthe most enjoyable characters are the most cartoonish . \nthe fairy godmother stand-in , leonardo da vinci ( patrick godfrey ) is fun to watch as the eccentric old man who advises danielle . \nhuston is enjoyable in her over-the-top wickedness . \nin all fairness , my companion loved the film . \nmaybe it's one of those \" chick flicks \" that men don't like . \nit is certainly a date film . \nnearly the entire audience was couples . \noh well , maybe it's good for something . \n", "i suppose it's unfair to criticize a movie like hudson hawk , which has been panned by reviewers and moviegoers alike since it's 1991 release . \nmichael lehmann's action-comedy was quick to win the title `biggest box office flop of all time' , or close thereof . \nthe movie stars bruce willis as renowned cat burglar hudson hawk , who's just been released from sing sing prison after many years in isolation ( `let me put it this way , ' he explains , `i never saw et' ) . \ngreeting him is his old friend and partner in crime ( played by danny aiello ) , who becomes the subject of many amusing fat jokes . \nthese are rather welcome in a movie filled with so many completely unfunny sight gags , cartoonish villains and unbelievable coincidences . \nit appears as if director lehmann didn't know when to stop all the absurd silliness , and he piles on layer after layer of utter ridiculousness as the movie propels itself toward the finish line . \nif at some point during hudson hawk you make the assumption that things couldn't get goofier , you'll soon be eating your words . \nbut , i'm inclined to say that this film is not quite as terrible as it's box office numbers suggest . \nit's fast-paced and entertaining , if you've got incredible patience and a warped sense of humor . \nfor the first portion of this review , i'm going to try and center on the positive aspects of hudson hawk . \nwish me luck . \nfirst and foremost : bruce willis is a good sport . \nwhile i'm not entirely sure what he was smoking when he co-wrote this script , willis is quite aware that the entire project is a big , fat , ugly joke . \nhe constantly gives deadpan reactions to things that are very silly and out-of-place , which means he has more than his share of deadpan reactions . \nanother plus is the appearance of andie macdowell as a schizophrenic nun and love interest for the title character . \nthey meet when hudson goes on a mission to steal a priceless book from the vatican , and their relationship escalates in interest from there . \nit's unfortunate that mcdowell's one-note character is used just as an excuse for there to be a predictable plot-twist , and she offers absolutely no encouraging chemistry with willis . \nbut now i'm rambling on again about the negative things , aren't i ? \nenough of the charade - for the most part , hudson hawk is an excruciating experience . \nit's stupid , pointless and repetitive . \ni can only wonder what bruce willis fans thought after exiting the theater , because this film really doesn't have the potential to please anyone . \naction fans should take note that hudson hawk is composed of 90% comedy , and even the action sequences are skittery , rushed and poorly edited . \nand those expecting a hearty laugh or two will find it difficult even to smirk during all of the headache-inducing hi-jinks . \ndon't get me wrong , this film is not devoid of laughs . \nit's too bad most of them are unintentional , or just plain forced . \nthe impressive cast looks suitably embarrassed . \nit's understandable to see willis and aiello in a movie of this caliber , but as for the presence of future academy award winner james coburn i'm not entirely sure . \ncoburn plays a former nemesis of the hawk who again comes into play , and he looks unsure of his place the entire movie . \nespecially when he resorts to martial arts during the final showdown , and has a fight with willis that would look right at home in a jackie chan film . \nthings get more bizarre when we're introduced to his team of rejects named after chocolate bars , including future nypd blue star david caruso as the speechless , card-flipping kit-kat . \nif that's not enough for you , there's richard e . grant and sandra bernhard hamming it up as a deranged couple on the brink of a convoluted economic takeover . \ntheir crotch-biting pooch provides a couple of the big laughs here . \nwait , maybe the only big laughs . . . \ni'm not sure what kind of movie everyone had in mind when filming hudson hawk . \ni can't even begin to start about the film's absurd plot ; but let's not get into that . \ni suppose there's some amusement viewers could derive from the ridiculous premise , if they were that desperate . \nbut hudson hawk never even has a clue of where it's going from minute one , and from there it's 90 minutes of pure cinematic muck . \n", "if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film , it was studio 54 , the late steve rubell's infamous new york discotheque , which came to symbolize the taboo-smashing excesses of the disco era's heyday : easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone , all set to a thumping dance beat . \nso when miramax started production on _54_ last year , the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began : an edgy film as down-and-dirty as the club itself , written and directed by a promising first-timer ( mark christopher ) and starring some hot young talent ( salma hayek , neve campbell , newcomer ryan phillippe , and mike myers in his dramatic debut ) . \nmy , how easily does the worm turn . \nhype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th-hour reshoots ( wrapped only a month ago ) , a rash of studio-imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew ( especially christopher ) unhappy , and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics . \nat the last minute , though , miramax did decide to screen the film ( so hastily scheduled was the screening that myers's last name was misspelled on the invitation , not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes ) for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed , myself included . \nand with good reason--somehow , some way , the supremely disappointing _54_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism . . . \nboring . \nalthough christopher has distanced himself from the finished film , he still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_'s lifelessness . \n_54_ focuses , for the most part , on a tight-knit trio of employees at the club : coat check girl/aspiring disco diva anita ( a wasted hayek ) ; her busboy husband , greg ( breckin meyer ) ; and , most prominently , the fresh-from-jersey shane o'shea ( phillippe ) , who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender . \nthese characters are about as generic as those descriptions . \nin focusing on the hired help , christopher really missed the boat . \nwith the exception of the flamboyant , always-woozy rubell ( myers , in a well-modulated turn ) , the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers' but those of the people who went there to party ; not necessarily the numerous vip guests , but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club's famously hard-ass doormen and dance ( among other things ) the night away with the rich , famous , and infamous ( the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow's feisty dottie , a disco- and drug-crazed granny , but she's a peripheral character at best ) . \nas such , aside from the expected overhead crowd shots , there is precious little actual _dancing_ in _54_ . \nwhat is a disco film--especially one about the pinnacle of the movement--without the dancing ? \neven whit stillman's _the_last_days_of_disco_ , which wasn't so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hip-to-only-themselves club-hopping preppies , featured at least one extended dance scene . \ndancing isn't the only thing glazed over in _54_--so is the sex , but that may not be entirely christopher's fault . \nfrom what i've heard , his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring , starting with the shane character : he was conceived ( and actually filmed ) as a wild , morally ambiguous bisexual , which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54's legend . \nbut somewhere between principal photography and the final cut , shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out ; consequently , so was the film . \naside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film , shane's fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie ( sela ward ) , and an abbreviated bedhopping montage , the sexual dimension is just about ignored . \nshane , in this incarnation , is sanitized to the point of blandness , an idealistic do-gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club , julie black ( campbell ) , a worldly soap star with , yes , a heart of gold . \nthis tacked-on \" romance \" would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience . \nthey fail on both counts . \nultimately , _54_'s failure comes down to three letters : f-u-n . \nas in , there isn't any to be had for the audience . \ntoo much time is spent with the boring shane , and too little is spent on the club floor , where all the action took place . \nanyhow , though , whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively . \nwhen anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club , it should be a euphoric height , for her , the crowd , and the audience ; however , the moment doesn't get a chance to reach that level , for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality , which also mars the film's conclusion ( one of the last-minute reshoots ) . \nstrangely upbeat and wistful , the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying . \nthere is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there--two of them , in fact--but _54_ is not one of them . \nthey're on cable tv : a couple of documentaries produced by e ! and vh1 . \nthese two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goings-on within it show that there's still a great disco movie to be made . \nthe problem is , after the critical and certain box office failure of _54_ , the subject may have run its hollywood course . \n", "a hotshot lawyer gets an obviously guilty child molester acquitted , and shortly after during the victory celebration gets offered an opportunity to show his prowess in new york city . \nthe lawyer , kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is not offered a job yet , he is asked to simply pick a jury . \nhe accepts . \nthe jury he selects work out well and before long he is offered a job with the firm . \nmaking his decision easy is the fact that not only is he offered big money , but a gorgeous apartment . \nhe convinces his wife , mary ann ( charlize theron ) to make the move to new york . \nthe first case given to him is a big test ; a \" winless \" case concerning a man who sacrifices animals in his basement . \nthe charge was health code violations and kevin once again shows his skill and earns an acquittal . \nhis new boss and partner in the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) is quite impressed and takes kevin under his wing , explaining many of his philosophies on law , women and sex , and angles the promise of a blissful , wealthy life . \nkevin's next case is a dream case , given to him by milton himself ( much to the chagrin to his colleagues ) , defending a triple murder suspect who has had a history of problems with the law . \nalthough kevin's career is taking off , his home life is not doing very well . \nmary ann is starting to have numerous problems . \nshe is experiencing severe depression over kevin's long hours , and before long is having horrible dreams and hallucinations of people turning into ghouls , their faces becoming horribly disfigured . \nkevin does not help matters by dismissing his wife . \nhe does not spend more time with her as he explains to milton that he needs to spend as much time on the case as possible to get it over with , then focus all of his attention on his wife . \nnot helping matters is the fact that kevin is having ideas about a possible affair with a sexy lawyer ( connie nielson ) also working with the firm . \nmary ann falls deeper into her madness as kevin spends more time away from home . \nkevin eventually looses control of his life and has to institutionalize his wife , and gets disturbing news from his mother ( judith ivey ) about the mystery concerning the identity of his father . \nhe also starts to lose control of his case . \nkevin learns that all of his problems have been caused by the work of one man . \nthat man is his boss , mr . milton , a truly evil character who just may be the devil himself . \nkevin must somehow confront milton and thwart whatever diabolical plan he has in store . \nbut how do you defeat the devil ? \nwhy is it that most courtroom scenes in the movies are absurd ? \ndo filmmakers really believe that \" normal \" courtroom drama doesn't fit the bill and they have to juice them up ? \nthe courtroom scenes in this movie would never happen in a real courtroom , which wouldn't have been too bad if it weren't keanu reeves trying to pull it off . \ni give reeves credit for trying hard , but throughout the movie i never saw the kevin lomax character , just an actor trying very hard to play kevin lomax and coming up short . \ncharlize theron defines the term \" over-the-top \" in her performance as mary ann lomax , a disappointment in contrast to her good performance in \" 2 days in the valley \" . \nthe only good performance in the movie is by al pacino , but i kept asking myself what the heck he was doing in this mess ? \nmaybe he felt it would be interesting playing the devil , and you can tell he is having fun doing so , but his skill as an actor cannot save the poor performances and lackluster script that surround him . \nit's pretty standard stuff , including the fact that the hotshot lawyer appears to be the only competent person on the planet who can do anything right in the courtroom . \nplease read no further if you do not want the ending spoiled , but i have to get something off of my chest . \nin 1986 i remember watching a movie called \" wisdom \" with emilio estevez and demi moore , and the ending of that film did the worst possible thing that a movie could do . \nwhat i like to call \" guess what , it was all a dream \" scenario . \nin \" wisdom \" the two lead characters are killed at the end , only to have one of the characters \" wake up \" from an apparent and say \" gosh , i'm glad that didn't really happen ! \" . \ni considered it inexcusable the way the audience was toyed with . \nwell , the same thing happens in \" the devils advocate \" , and although arguments could be made surrounding whether it was actually a dream ( perhaps milton went back in time to try a different route for his plan , since it failed and he is the devil ) , but the point is that the last 90% of the film didn't happen . \ni know it's a stretch , after all it is a movie and nothing really happened , but i just get annoyed to get toyed with like that . \nof course , the dream ending could almost be forgiven if the story that precedes it was at least an interesting one . \nas i recall , \" wisdom \" was a decent film . \n \" the devil's advocate \" is not . \nthe devils advocate

the movie comprises a revenge arc , enough costume changes to fill three productions of les miserables , carbon-copy fight sequences that would lend credible evidence to a jackie chan and the wachowski brothers lawsuit for intellectual property theft , and the strange transformation of sam rockwell into mickey rourke's long-lost brother . \ncharlie's angels starts off with a bang and ends up being a soggy burrito left out overnight . \nnothing is difficult , plausible , or believable in any of the angels' actions . \nit feels like the matrix , mission : impossible 2 , and cleopatra jones and the casino of gold all rolled into one . \ndiaz is a knucklehead . \nbarrymore is the \" dangerous one , \" mean and tough and about as believable as katie holmes in the role . \nliu is just . . . \nlucy liu , looking good in a skin-tight black leather suit . \nthe list of movies from which charlie's angels is directly lifted is equally astonishing . \nthe writers apparently ran the copier all night stealing scenes from armageddon , lethal weapon ii , all of jackie chan's movies , the great escape , saturday night fever , revenge of the nerds , payback , darkman , dr . no , the matrix ( as mentioned ) , and even tv's friends . \nit's a shame , too , because one of the many screenwriters , john august , was at the helm of last year's favorite , go . \nthen again , what can you expect from a director known solely as \" mcg . \" \nthere is no camp value in the film , no interesting main characters , no invigorating action scenes , no reason at all to waste your time except to ogle the hot chicks and enjoy the performances of a few supporting players . \nnote to hollywood : next time , let's leave the tv shows on the tv . \n", "i have always been a fan of director neil jordan , from his early work , such as 1984's \" the company of wolves , \" to 1992's \" the crying game , \" and 1994's \" interview with a vampire . \" \nhis latest film , \" the butcher boy , \" is a return to his roots in ireland , but unfortunately , it is not a successful homecoming . \ntold through the eyes of a 12-year-old irish boy , francis ( newcomer eomann owens ) , this peculiar film follows him as we learn a little about his decidedly unstable life . \nhis father ( stephen rea ) is an indifferent alcoholic , his mother ( fiona shaw ) is mentally ill and always in and out of hospitals , and francis himself delights in terrorizing the mother of one of his friends after he is forbidden to see him anymore . \nfrancis is the type of boy who always has a lot to say , but mostly fluctuates between sarcasm and frightening honesty , and it quickly becomes apparent that he may very well be a little psychotic , even capable of brutal murder . \nthe premise of , \" the butcher boy , \" is one that could have very well been turned into a thought-provoking , disturbing motion picture , but somehow nothing works . \nfrancis is in almost every scene , but we learn very little about him , as if the film was distancing itself away from him when , i suspect , we were actually supposed to sympathize with him . \nthis is definately not young owens fault , however , because he gives a brilliantly accurate performance , and is able to also seem menacing as well . \nthe fact that we don't get close to his character is because of the sloppy screenplay . \nthe supporting characters are no help , though . \nrea is wasted , and has practically no scenes where he actually talks to his son , or to anyone else for that matter . \nhe usually seems to just be sitting watching the television throughout . \nshaw has a little bit more to work with , since she has one touching scene in which she talks to francis in a time of despair , but is out of the picture just as we are beginning to know her . \nand singer sinead o'connor appears rather effectively as the virgin mary who occasionally gives francis advice . \nthe pacing is all off in , \" the butcher boy . \" \nalthough the story could have been dynamite , it moves at a deadeningly slow rate , and i found my mind wandering every once in a while . \nit is also very episodic , because the developments in the story fly by with no satisfying payoffs . \nat one point , francis is sent away to a juvenile prison , and an odd , possibly sexual relationship begins to develop between a priest and himself , but nothing comes of it . \ni'd rather think of , \" the butcher boy , \" as a brief diversion for director jordan , rather than a total misfire . \nhe has already proven to be a strong director , but he lucked out with this latest film . \nwhat could have been a courageous , unsettling character study of an emotionally disturbed young boy , only manages to be an ineffective , uninvolivng bore . \n", "as you should know , this summer has been less than memorable . \nwith a total of 4 decent films , it's not a surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing . \nwith that said , you can pretty much predict what my opinion on \" the 13th warrior \" will be . \nthe film is based on the michael crichton \" eaters of the dead \" , in which ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished from his country for looking at a wife of a king . \nafter tarveling for many months , he comes across a gang of norsemen , who are forced to pick 13 men to protect a town from mythical monsters who travel in the fog . \nso , they start picking men , and are left without 1 , thus ahmed is choosen . \nso far it sounds interesting right ? \nnot when all of this takes place in 15 minutes . \nafter that , they basically run around killing . \nthat alone shows how much a script is needed for a film , because once your story is introduced , you have the rest of the film to start developing it . \nobviously that's not the case here . \neven if you are going into the film expecting an action packed adventure , you will be disappointed . \nsince all the action takes place in fog , it is constantly hard to see a scene clearly due to those circumstances , and to poor camera work . \ncan't the camera men sit still ? \ni'd like to actually watch a film in focus , but again , they failed to deliver that as well . \nthe film moves on and on until the point , where you can care less about anything but the popcorn you're eating . \nwith corny dialogue , that the characters laugh at for some odd reason , a script that goes nowhere , dull action sequences , a predictable ending , and worst of all weak characters , there's basically nothing to like here , except for maybe the set designs . \nthat's the only thing that honestly caught my interest . \nwhen i heard that john mctiernan , the director , wanted his name kept out of the project , that made me wonder why ? \nwell now i know . \ncrichton's greed forced mctiernan to edit his finished product , which led to a big arguement . \nwhat's there to argue about anyway ? \nthe film couldn't be saved , no matter how much they spent or casted . \nseeing films like the haunting and big daddy making money , i wouldn't be surprised to see \" the 13th warrior \" become a hit . \nplease do me a favor and save your money at all costs , or else you will be lost in the fog , like the film itself . \n", "if i were one of those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact on the success or failure of certain films , i might say that i review movies that don't look particularly good because i'm doing a service to my readers by warning them against seeing it . \nif that were true , i could put a banner at the top of my site that reads : \" shay casey : seeing bad movies so you don't have to . \" \nbut i know that's bunk-you're going to see whatever movies you want to no matter what i say . \nso i have to tell the truth : every once in a while i get a nasty , masochistic urge to see a bad movie . \nyou know the feeling , when you're sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want to see something you can have a ball trashing mercilessly . \nsometimes i think that's why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies , ever . \nadmit it : sometimes you like seeing bad movies . \nso do i . \nso i saw \" supernova . \" \ntruth be told , \" supernova \" wasn't quite as bad as i thought it might be . \nmaybe i just felt sorry for the actors , or maybe i thought it could have been decent if the studio hadn't started tinkering with the director's ( walter hill ) final cut , causing him to want his name removed . \nmaybe i'm becoming a softy . \nin any case , i didn't find \" supernova \" as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe . \nbut it's still bad . \nthe film takes place aboard the medical space vessel \" nightingale . \" \nthe crew includes captain a . j . \nmarley ( robert forster ) , his new second officer nick vanzant ( james spader ) , head medical officer kaela evers ( angela bassett ) , medical technicians yerzy penalosa ( lou diamond phillips ) and danika lund ( robin tunney ) , and computer technician benj sotomejor ( wilson cruz ) . \nthere are some attempts at \" characterization , \" but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction , which puts kaela on edge , yerzy and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissy-faces at each other every five minutes , and benj ( apparently gay ) is in love with the computer ( apparently female ) . \ndon't expect any more explanation , because you won't get it . \nanyway , the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent . \nduring the dimension jump ( i think that's what it's called , but don't hold me to it ) , the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal ( peter facinelli ) is brought on board . \nhe calls himself troy larson , making him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with . \nthen a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening . \nhave you seen \" alien ? \" \nhave you seen \" event horizon \" ( a lame movie in its own right ) ? \ngood . \nthen you've seen \" supernova . \" \npost-production cuts or not , there is nothing original about this screenplay , and nothing unpredictable either . \nafter all , no one's going to think for a second that troy won't turn out to be a villain . \nbut the bigger problem with \" supernova \" is that it can' t just stick to the simple plot it's afforded . \nnumerous re-writes ( the script may be credited to three people , but it's a gross underestimate ) have crammed this lean 90-minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped . \nwas there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot ? \ndid the ship's computer learn something about humanity ? \nwhat was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him ? \nand just what does the film's title signify , if anything ? \nas far as i can tell , it refers to a very small plot detail that isn't developed , just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements . \ncharacter relationships in this film also make very little sense . \nfor some reason , every person in this film keeps having sex . \nwe get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes . \nbassett and spader's characters start off hating each other . \nfifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later , they're engaging in some hanky-panky . \nwhen troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship , of course both female crew members will fall in love with him . \nevery single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly , which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut . \nthe most prominent example , however , may be the fact that when the film starts , there are no opening credits ! \nfurthermore , the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits . \nmaybe that's why the film's title is mentioned twice during the end credits , right between james spader and robert forster . \nright after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you're seeing ( lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery ) , you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene , with little-to-no introduction to any of the characters or situations . \nthe rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes ( you know , where they explain things ) and just went from point a to point b . point a : danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby . \npoint b : tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing . \ndoesn't make sense . \nsince i didn't understand anything about these characters' motivations , did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one-by-one ( and he does , knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes ) ? \nnot a whit . \nit's a shame , because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do . \nthey don't find it . \nbassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces . \nsexual tension ? \nmore like constipation . \nmaybe they're just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as \" this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and a whole lot less nice . \" \nnot that we ever find out who that is , mind you . \nthe climax of their relationship ( taking place in a transport pod ) is probably the film's biggest forehead-slapper . \nas troy , peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected . \nhe' s awfully one-note , but it's not as if he's given any more notes to work with . \nthe rest of the cast does even less . \ntunney stands around looking cute , then scared . \nphillips broods . \ncruz flirts with the computer . \nthen they all die and a star blows up or something , but i really wasn't paying much attention by then . \n \" supernova \" is pretty awful , but i'm cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got . \nthat's it . \nif you expect it to be good ( for whatever reasons you may have ) , you'll probably hate it more than i will . \neven the special effects are fairly unimpressive , nothing you haven' t seen before , and suffice to say the script isn't going to save the film . \nhonestly , though , what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym ? \nit usually results in a bad movie , and that's what \" supernova \" is . \n", "for timing reasons having to do with baby sitters , we recently went to a multiplex and saw undercover blues . \ni would give it one half of a star for guts . \nanyone in a movie this bad would have to

had characters who talked with funny accents in an attempt to make you laugh . \nthey had lots of \" great \" sight gags like two people trying to go in a door together and therefore bumping shoulders

1993 \nopinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's . \n", "the obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits . \nthe rationale is sound , but in many cases of this and recent years , the sequel is a shoddy product that's exposed for the cash-milking vehicle it really is . \nlast year's speed 2 and scream 2 , as well as this year's species ii have all been products that have been decisively less than satisfactory . \nin some cases , a sequel can even discredit its predecessor , as with the latest neo-slasher flick , i still know what you did last summer . \nwhatever uniqueness the original might've had now seems trite and overplayed when paired with this abominable thriller . \njulie james ( jennifer love hewitt ) and ray bronson ( freddie prinze jr . ) are back from the original to star in i still know , reprising their roles in typical fashion . \njulie and ray experience a rather predictable falling-out at the beginning of the movie , leaving the door wide open for newcomer will benson ( matthew settle ) . \nwill and julie hit it off , and along with friends karla ( brandy norwood ) and tyrell ( mekhi phifer ) , the foursome heads off to a radio station-giveaway vacation in the tropics . \nunfortunately , things aren't so peachy once they arrive , and with a regularity you could set your watch by , the infamous fisherman ( muse watson ) is back with his hook . \nit's another bloody showdown , complete with cliffhanger ending . \nthere's not much that's original about i still know , and with the market saturated by gen-x thrillers like this one , it's unlikely that i still know will get any recognition other than that of a bad sequel . \nfor die-hard fans of the genre , this will be required viewing material , but the bottom line is that the material here is just recycled from the original i know what you did last summer . \nthe aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot isn't heightened by skillful scripting or camera work , but rather a tense , string-based score and manipulative editing . \nthe man with the hook ends up becoming very belittled this time around when the script gives him too many lines of dialogue -- he goes from being a scary figure to a nutcase in a few short and painful moments . \nmuch of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point . \nthe whole reason the plot exists - julie and karla must guess the capital of brazil in order to win the trip from the radio station - is a dead giveaway , lessening suspense and creating a hurry-up-and-wait timing problem . \nand , whereas the killer's identity might've been a question in the first movie , it's almost a given here , which changes the dynamic of the movie drastically . \nthree or four teens run automatically from a man in a rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as \" the killer . \" \nthey're almost used to it , and the performances show it - not hewitt , nor prinze , nor brandy , nor phifer give a decent show . \nand so , in the end , it's left wide open for a third movie and - most likely - a brand new supporting cast . \ngod help us . \n", "i'm a dedicated fan of writer kevin williamson's work . \nhe always finds a clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain . \nwith teaching mrs . tingle , his directorial debut , williamson has reached the end of his rope . \nwhat used to be intelligent about his films is hopelessly stale here . \nthe components are all there , including an encouraging premise that all high school students can relate to . \nbut where are the thrills ? \nthe laughs ? \nboth are supposedly absent from this draggy exercise in elaborate revenge . \nand what a shame that is . \ni loved the scream films - heck , i even enjoyed the sci-fi goofiness of the faculty . \nkevin williamson was the reason horror films were such a big draw at the box office . \nteaching mrs . tingle , a black comedy that will leave a gaping void in his optimistic followers , may put an end to his reign . \nor perhaps it will encourage him to spend more time perfecting a script than to worry about his directing duties . \ni still have my faith , but i fear the name of kevin williamson may soon be a forgotten echo of the past . \nthe title character of his pet project is a vicious , uncaring history teacher who is played deliciously over-the-top by british actress helen mirren . \nmrs . tingle is basically every student's worst nightmare : a heartless human being bent on distributing poor marks to even the most hard-working of her pupils . \nthe principal ( michael mckean ) is horrified of her , and she is unanimously despised among her fellow staff members . \ni enjoyed the fact that everyone in the hallway quickly steers out of her way . \nmirren's performance is one of the very few delights in this distressingly hollow black comedy that goes down like a flat soft drink . \nin other words , it's a poor substitute for williamson's best work . \nthe plot is a big problem here . \nmaterial that could have been enjoyable is rendered totally ridiculous by poor handling on the part of the director . \nthe likable katie holmes plays leigh ann , an over-achiever hoping to get a college scholarship . \nbut typical mrs . tingle says her history project , which she worked on for countless hours , is laughable . \nlater on while studying in the gymnasium , a classmate ( barry watson ) offers her a photo-copied duplicate of mrs . tingle's final exam . \nleigh ann's best friend ( marisa coughlan ) encourages her to use it . \nalas , the old hag herself finds the three scheming , and snatches the test , and prepares to talk to the principal in the morning . \nin the morning . . . \nhow convenient ! \nthe three students head to mrs . tingle's house , attempting to set the facts straight and clear leigh ann's name . \nthings get out of hand , and the teacher gets knocked unconscious in a tussle . \nthe plan is to tie her to a bed and try to get some reasoning out of her . \nof course , not everything goes entirely to plan . \nbesides pointless sub-plots involving the football coach ( jeffrey tambor , horribly wasted ) , there is little by way of actual progress . \nthere is no urgency to the situation ; little tension or laughs are involved . \nthe humor is completely inconsistent . \nafter many of the jokes , the theater was so silent i could have heard a fly sneeze . \nyou continue to await some momentum in the story , something that could possibly revive the slow pace . \na moment like that never arises . \nwilliamson also does a handsome job of wasting some of the key supporting players , including the talented mckean and larry sanders' vet tambor . \nand the beautiful vivica a . fox has one lifeless scene as a caring guidance counselor , and then williamson disposes of her character entirely . \non the plus side , holmes and coughlan are admirable ( with the latter giving a frighteningly believable exorcism impression ) , and molly ringwald has an amusing cameo appearance as a substitute teacher . \nwhile everything is pretty lifeless , teaching mrs . tingle remains watchable . \nthere are a few promising ideas that pop up now and again , but anything remotely interesting is squandered by the inane script . \nmirren is easily the best reason to keep watching . \nshe is convincingly evil and fun to watch , but even her gifted delivery can't save individual scenes that flounder in boredom . \nif there is one word for the movie surrounding her , it would be `disappointing' . \nbasically , kevin williamson is his worst enemy here . \nhis uneventful direction prevents any aspects of his screenplay to be appreciated ( not that his writing here is especially good ) . \nwe will see , when rookie screenwriter ehren kruger writes the third installment in the scream franchise this christmas , whether williamson is for real . \n", "a film that means well , but is too pushy in promoting its belabored point and too sentimental to be compelling as a drama . \nit's jeroen krabb ? 's melodrama about a community of jews in antwerp in 1972 who can't forget their bitter past . \nthe heroine is an attractive , carefree , nonreligious 20-year-old , chaja ( fraser ) , who wants to forget her jewish roots by getting involved in student demonstrations , screwing a student rebel leader , and living with her gentile friends away from her nagging mother ( s ? gebrecht ) and her self-absorbed , eccentric father ( schell ) . \nher parents are survivors of the holocaust concentration camps , and her home life is filled with angst . \nher mother is in denial about the past always busying herself by cooking soup and baking cakes and complaining about everything , while her father is more openly loving but has recently been absorbed in searching for two suitcases filled with mementos , a family album , silverware , and his old violin . \nhe buried them in a garden during the war while fleeing the nazis , but can't locate them now due to all the changes in the city . \nout of frustration after quitting her job as a dishwasher and facing eviction from her apartment , she reluctantly accepts a job as a nanny with an hasidic couple that an old man in her parents' apartment building , mr . apfelschnitt ( topol ) , tells her about . \nthe hasidics are ultra-orthodox : they don't go to the cinema or watch tv , adhere to strict dress codes , and strictly observe their religious laws . \nchaja is at first put off by the way they expect her to follow their rules , but soon finds the wife , mrs . kalman ( rossellini ) , to be kind and she becomes attached to one of her 5 children , a 4-year-old named simcha ( monty ) who doesn't talk . \nthe stern mr . kalman ( krabb ? ) is not friendly to her and considers her to be a whore because of the way she dresses . \nto hammer home the point of how anti-semitism hasn't gone away there's a barrage of overdone and uninvolving scenes with a sneering concierge ( bradley ) , who keeps making nasty remarks about jews and tries to make things inconvenient for them by preventing the jewish family from using the elevator . \nthe film is done in by its ham-fisted script as the story , adapted from carl friedman's book \" the shovel and the loom , \" goes from one false note to another until it gets lost in all the goo of its sentimentality . \nit starts off telling chaja's story of how she's a lost jewess trying to find her identity , then to her nanny role as she loves a mute child stuck in an insulated environment , and then it makes it a story about the lingering effects of the bitter past that can't be forgotten . \nthe effort seemed heavy-handed , as the film kept delivering too many obvious messages that it ponderously kept delivering through the stock characters . \nthe supporting cast consists of all wooden characters who give their roles a cartoonish flavoring : chaja's parents are given no human shades , while the janitor villain was a particularly annoying role that was one-dimensional and falsely acted . \nthe only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were fraser , whose effervescent face was expressive of both the trying times she was going through and the joys she felt -- but most admirably showing how she could be so mistaken as to think that she could forget her roots ; while rossellini gave a warm performance of a woman suffering in silence , but is strong in accepting her faith . \ntopol's reassuring performance as the wise man who says all the right things to fraser , acts as the true voice of the filmmaker in explaining all the sufferings with common sense . \nthe film brazenly uses little simcha to get across its agenda of pointing out how the patriarchal world can be cruel when it can't love : it starts out by showing how under chaja's loving care he's taken to the duck pond and soon starts jabbering away , beginning by saying 'quack , quack' and then going on to ask the four questions during a passover seder . \nbut by showing how the boy is so terrified of his strict father that he wets his pants in his presence , refuses to speak because of his stern dad , and eventually becomes the victim of a tragic accident , the film thereby exploits the boy's sufferings and his story just becomes tiresome and not sincerely done . \ni felt i didn't just see a movie , but i attended a lecture for the whole 100 minutes of this serious but unappetizing story . \nit was the kind of movie that you hoped would somehow end soon , as it seemed to be in the habit of rehashing its same viewpoint unnecessarily--the message it keeps sending was already received . \nin the last shot where father and daughter are hopelessly digging for the lost luggage , one has the impression that no one in the film learned anything about themselves or the past . \nthat seems strange , since i thought that was what this film was supposed to be about . \nunless i was mistaken and the film's real aim was to make us cry over simcha . \n", "the tagline for this film is : \" some houses are just born bad \" . \nso i didn't expect too much from this . \nbut i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre . \ni thought : liam neeson , cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont . \ni thought , mabe it will be fun ? \nand in fact the beginning was rather intriguing . \nbut by the end of it i thought : why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones , jan de bont ? . \nthese great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality . \nhere is the story : in the monstrously over-decorated mansion known as hill house , visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor ( liam neeson ) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation . \namong them is a sophisticated bisexual ( cathrine zeta jones ) , a cynical dope ( owen wilson ) and a gentle and emotional lady ( lily taylor ) . \nactually , the doctor is researching the \" primordial fear reaction \" and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens . \nbut he gets unexpected help from the house itself . \nit rumbles , hums and belches forth remarkable sights . \nportals become veiny stained-glass eyeballs . \na fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth . \nfilmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains . \nbut the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real , placing an emotional wall between audience and screen . \nthe second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture . \nis that exciting or what ? \nthe worst thing about it is that it didn't have to be bad . \nit's based on a great book , ``the haunting of hill house , '' by shirley jackson . \na 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent . \nit played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience . \n \" the blair witch project \" , that cost less than an old car , managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses . \nand with a $70 mill . \nbudget , de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror . \nde bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is , in itself , frightening . \nhe is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush . \nbut why give him a more serious material ? \nin the end \" haunting \" will only haunt its fledgling studio ( dream works skg ) and de bont's career as a director . \nyet it wouldn't be fair to say that everything is bad . \nthe effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated -- beautiful , mysterious , magical and spooky . \nbut this is where the good things end . \nthe music is blaring , the floors moving , the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming -- and all of this , every second , every moment of screen time , is absolutely without life . \nit's nothing more than a special effects-extravaganza ; visually impressive , but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn't engage . \nat first you do not know what's going on . \nis this part of the experiment ? \nare these hallucinations ? \nprojections of the subconscience ? \nparanoia ? \nbut in the end it shows out that this is actually happening . \nthe house is actually possessed . \nit is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window . \nfor ever , i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and that's what i got ? \ni believe hichock once said that \" it's better to wait for a climax , than to see one \" . \nthis may be true , and it might actually work , but there is only one problem -- jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary , only stupid . \nthey are impossible to take seriously . \nany paralells that you might have heard before , linking this picture to kubrick's \" the shining \" , are absolutely baseless . \n \" shining \" had class , style , story , acting , but most of all talent and originality . \n \" haunting \" has only special effects and art direction to boast of . \nand those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film . \ncasting good actors for small , pale parts only makes things worse . \nbut i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write , most of you will see this film anyway , even if the tagline would say : \" some films are just born stupid \" . \n", "porter stoddard ( warren beatty ) is a successful architect married to successful

for its torturous path to the screen , \" town and country . \" \n \" town and country \" has a pedigree befitting it's title with an all star cast photographed by oscar nominated cinematographer william fraker and mouthing the words of screenwriter buck henry ( \" the graduate \" ) under the direction of peter chelsom ( \" funny bones \" ) . \nafter years of reports of budget overruns and reshoots and the racking up twelve different release dates , the media has been prepped for beatty's next \" ishtar . \" \nso , is it that bad ? \nthe answer is no . \nbut it's not very good either . \nthe major problem with \" town and country \" is that it's unstructured and random . \nstoddard is immediately established as a philanderer , having just bedded a flaky cellist ( nastassja kinski ) . \nnext scene finds him and ellie celebrating their anniversary in paris with mona and griffin . \nthen mona spies griffin hustling a redhead into a motel and begins divorce proceedings ( buck henry cameos as both couples' divorce lawyer ) . \nellie thinks she's overeacting , but sends porter to support mona on a trip to check out her family's mississippi manse . \nthe two childhood friends end up in bed together , making us wonder why they'd never become a couple to begin with . \nback home , their second coupling is interrupted by ellie bursting in to tell mona she thinks porter's cheating on her . \nporter goes off on a trip with griffin to sun valley , idaho to have more comic misadventures with wacky women as griffin attempts to tell him that he's gay . \nthe four friends , along with every woman porter's dallied with , all end up back in new york city somewhat happily ever after . \nalthough the film begins promisingly , resembling a woody allen take on new york city wasps , too many strands drift off into nowhere . \nthe stoddard household is huge , containing two adult children ( josh hartnett , \" the virgin suicides \" and tricia vessey , \" kiss the girls \" ) , their colorful bedmates and a maid who's just imported her shirtless boyfriend from the rainforest back home . \nafter an amusing early scene that has porter overhearing three bouts of lovemaking while in search of a nocturnal snack , the six supporting players are dropped except for an out-of-nowhere appearance by the formerly forgotten son . \nporter's romantic misadventures with women ( other than mona ) are equally mishandled . \nonce the marital discord begins , the film seems as if it was editted with a machete , stopping and starting , never regaining its rhythm . \nwhile beatty gets off a few tart observations , his character is mostly passive and bemused . \nmaybe we're supposed to feel sympathy for an adulterer who doesn't initiate his own sex romps ? \nkeaton's ellie has a trusting nature that's a result of her own self involvement resulting in an unlikeable character . \nhawn smartly recycles her mature sex kitten wives of \" the out of towners \" and \" the first wives' club \" while shandling's relegated to true second banana status . \nkinski is bland and unmotivated . \nandie macdowell takes a weirdly unappealing role and does what she can with the screenplay's most bizarre subplot , which finds charlton heston as her rifle toting , billionaire daddy and marian seldes as her alcoholic , wheelchair-bound , foul-mouthed mother . \nheston and seldes are fun , as is jenna elfman as a sun valley bait and tackle salesgirl who brings porter and griffin to a halloween party . \noscar nominatored cinematographer william fraker gives the film a nice look , but director chelsom shows none of the quirkily and blackly humorous depth he brought to films like \" hear my song \" and \" funny bones . \" \nthe script is this film's weakest link - it's telling that most of the ( few ) laughs come from old-fashioned physical slapstick and the sight of beatty in a bear suit . \nwhile \" town and country \" isn't exactly painful to sit through , it mostly just lays there . \n", " * * the following review contains spoilers * * \n \" please someone stop joel schumacher before he vomits into a film canister again and tries to pass it off as a movie . \" \n-- chuck dowling , the jacksonville film journal \ni wrote the above sentence in my review for 1997's batman and robin . \napparently , no one heard my words . \noh , how i wish you had heard them . \noh how i wish someone had stopped him . . . \nbecause he's done it again . \nthe plot of 8mm is similar to the 1977 paul schrader film hardcore , a surprisingly decent and engrossing tale . \nin fact , it was everything that 8mm is not . \nin the opening minutes of 8mm , we see private detective tom welles ( nicolas cage ) working on a case for a prestigious member of the u . s . government . \nkeep this fact in mind , cage is trusted with an important case , which he solves . \nhe returns home to his wife and new daughter , and even finds time to rake his yard ( keep that in mind too , it's important as well ) . \nhe's hired by a rich elderly woman to solve a mystery . \nafter her husband's death she comes across a film in his private safe . \nit appears to be snuff film , a sort of urban legend of the pornography industry in which someone is actually brutally murdered for the camera . \nthe woman wants welles to locate the young girl in the film , hopefully to disprove that it is in fact a snuff film . \nso he sets off on a journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to discover the truth about the film . \nthe main problem with 8mm is that the whole film is completely pointless . \nwelles is actually selected for the case by the old woman's lawyer ( anthony heald , an actor who always plays the same type of character , that being a bad guy ) . \nwhen you first see him , your first instinct is that he's behind the whole thing . \nthe choice of casting does the film in . \nthen , as welles begins his investigation , at times we will see a shadowy figure following him . \nthe only person it could possibly be is the lawyer ( or someone sent by the lawyer ) because no one knows welles is even investigating anything yet . \nso your first instinct has now been confirmed . \nthen , when it is in fact revealed that the lawyer is a part of the whole thing , he tells welles that he was chosen for the case because he was young and inexperienced ( in one of those ridiculous \" since we're going to kill you anyway , why not tell you the whole thing \" moments ) . \nbut earlier when we see welles being hired for the case he's told that he was hired because he comes highly recommended . \nhuh ? \nalso , when the lawyer reveals himself to be a part of the whole thing , his main goal is to get the film back . \nso why did he give it up in the first place ? ! \nthe lawyer had the film the whole time , then gave it away to the private detective thinking that he would just give up on the case and return the film ? ! \nit's totally absurd . . . \nand this is the screenwriter of seven ? \nlate in the film there's a confrontation between all the main characters , and after a struggle one of the character's guns ends up underneath a car . \ncage , who has been handcuffed to a bed , is rapidly trying to get to his gun , which is on a table . \njames gandolfini's character goes for the gun under the car in what is supposed to be a scene of \" suspense \" . \nyou see , the gun is just slightly out of reach from the side of the car he's trying to reach it from , and so instead of going around the car to the other side ( where he can easily reach it ) he just keeps stretching . \ngo around to the other side of the car ! ! \nthis goes on for minutes . \nthen , after cage gets his gun , gandolfini then decides it would be best to go around to the other side of the car . \nboy , schumacher is really really getting on my nerves . \ni think the final straw would be when cage returns home , devastated by everything that he's seen on this case , and then is no longer able to rake his lawn ! \nwe actually see a shot of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard . \nother things that bugged me about 8mm : one would be the music , if you can call it that . \nwhenever the score starts up , it sounds like techno music , and then this awful indian or middle eastern type music will accompany it . \nawful decision there joel . \nanother is cage's performance . \nat this point he's capable of a wide range of performances , either good or bad . \nfor 8mm , he delivers a very wooden one , and only shines when he's interacting with joaquin phoenix ( who gives a great performance as a porn shop clerk with a heart of gold who helps cage with his case ) . \nyou're capable of much better mr . cage . \nnow as for you mr . schumacher . . . \ni'm starting to doubt if you're capable of anything else besides urinating onto the institution of american cinema . \n[r] \n", "there have been bad films in recent years : 'mr . \nmagoo' was by far the worst ever made , the spectacularly bad 'blue in the face' , the horrible 'baby genuises' and now 'i woke up early the day i died' . \nit may not however be the worst movie made but it certainly ranks as one bad movie . \nthe film's acting ( if that's what you want to call it ) is well mediocre to me . \nloaded with a sensational cast you would think that the cast would at least save the film a bit , boy was i wrong . \nafter escaping from a mental institution 'the thief' played by billy zane goes out in the real world and finds that it is pretty harsh and gritty . \nhe turns to burglary to survive , robs a loan back , kills the loan officer and runs with thousands . \na country-wide man hunt is on for him to catch him and bring him down . \nhe ends up in a cemetery where he puts his money in a coffin to keep it for later , comes back and realizes that someone took it and put it somewhere . \nnow he is determined to kill all the visitors at the funeral earlier that day until he gets his money back , ultimately leading to a finale that is less that satisfying . \na film which was based on a 'long-lost' script by ed wood , i have only one question : no dialogue , only music and movement where exactly is the point ? \nthe film moves along at a rather slow pace , but does have one advantage : the soundtrack which is catchy and vibrant except the first song which can be offensive to some . \nit opens with a fun , innovative opening credits sequence and quickly goes downhill after that . \nsome of the low points are when 'the thief' steals a woman's purse , and then she faints , sandra bernhard as a dancer and tippi hendren as a deaf woman whom 'the thief' kills to the music of 'psycho' . \ncome on people get some new ideas already ! \nwhat's even worse is that the film has no plot at all . \nwell to a certain extent it does , but who cares by the time the middle of the film arrives we're bored out of our mind and ready for something fun and exciting to happen . \n'i woke up early the day i died' is a perfectly bad film . \nit shows us how low filmmakers get sometimes just when desperate to make a movie . \neven with the huge cast talent , the film is a waste of my time and certainly a waste of yours . \n", "it would be hard to choose the best american political thriller . \nsome people would probably pick the manchurian candidate and others ( myself included ) would pick seven days in may . \nboth those films were tense exercises in chills . \nthe two films came out within two years of each other and both were directed by the same man , john frankenheimer . \nbut that was 1962 and 1964 respectively . \nfor most of the rest of his career frankenheimer has turned out some decent films , but has shown little of the promise that those two thrillers showed . \neach of those films had memorable characters and a tense plot . \nthey had almost nothing in the way of chases or gunplay . \nthe thrills all came from the plot . \nronin is like a film made by another man . \nsomewhere behind all the shooting and explosions and car chases there are the rudiments ofa plot , but we see only tiny pieces of it . \nwe get a clue here and one there as to what is going on but j . d . zeik's screenplay is a bit obscure . \nthe film begins explaining that a ronin is a masterless samurai . \nwhen a samurai has failed in the job of protecting his master from death , he becomes a ronin , much like a gunfighter in the american west . \nif you miss the opening , do not worry . \nthis film will explain again what a ronin is . \nsam ( played by robert de niro ) is the modern equivalent of a ronin . \nhe is a free agent who seems to have really good instincts about how to stay alive the world of a professional killer . \nhe clearly was in a dangerous business at one time and now he seems to be drifting around on his own somewhere in france . \nsam is recruited from a montmartre bar by dierdre ( natascha mcelhone of the truman show ) , an irish woman , to be part of an action to steal a mysterious metal case . \ndierdre is very tight-lipped about what is in the case . \nsam joins a team of four others : vincent ( jean reno of the professional/leon and mission impossible ) , spence ( sean bean , tv's richard sharpe , and also patriot games and goldeneye ) , and gregor ( stellan skarsgard of breaking the waves and good will hunting ) . \nalso along is larry ( skipp suddeth ) . \nthe group seems to know their business , particularly sam , but each is in his own way cold and professional with his own field of expertise . \ntheir only human side seems to be in tensions among the members of the team . \nthe story is not very easy to follow . \nit is never clear who is double-crossing whom and who is working for whom . \nsomehow russians ( who may or may not be the russian mafia ) and irish radicals are involved trying to get their hands on a certain metal case . \nsome very good actors are involved in this film . \none wonders what they saw in the script . \nthe characters are mostly one-dimensional professional killers . \nthey know their work , and seeing their thought patterns adds some interest to the film , but for this group deep feeling between two people is teaming up with another killer so that neither is killed . \nby the end of the film we never really got to know anybody . \nmaybe that is the secret of why such good actors took parts , since these are not very demanding characters to create . \nin addition to the above characters the film also features jonathan pryce and michael lonsdale ( the latter of moonraker and of the superior thriller the day of the jackal ) . \nas a revival of a sort of action film that was popular in the 1960s , i was hoping that there would be something here to grab onto and enjoy . \nunfortunately there are no deep characters , and little to make us care who eventually ends up with the metal case or why they want it . \ni rate ronin a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \nnon-spoiler : incidentally , the tale of the 47 ronin has been filmed multiple times , usually under the title chushingura or as the 47 ronin . \nalso one frequently sees in japanese art the image of a man breaking down a door with a huge mallet . \nthis is the first blow of the 47 ronin . \n", "the main problem with martin lawrence's pet project , a thin line between love and hate , like any fatal attraction variation where the protagonist is a man , is that his character is an irresponsible jerk , and if that is the case , it doesn't seem to do anything except justify the woman's actions . \nthat is especially the case in lawrence's darnell wright . \nhe is one of those macho guys with women lined up a mile long . \nnow don't think i condone this just because i'm male . \nmy philosophy is , if you are one of the few heterosexual males lucky enough to get your hands on a beautiful , kind girl , you should treat her like a princess and respect her . \ndarnell doesn't think like this . \nhe sleeps with these girls once and dumps them . \nand by the period in the film he discovered that his newest target , beautiful , wealthy brandi web ( played nicely by whitfield ) who runs a successful real estate business , is out to kill him for dumping her for his childdhood friend mia ( king ) , i found myself thinking , \" i'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy ? \" \nafter all , it is largely darnell's fault . \nif he is lining up all these women , you'd think he'd have enough common sense to think it would backfire on him one day , as his mother says it does . \nbut he doesn't , so you get the sense that he's not only irresponsible , but also pretty dumb . \nyou especially get this sense that he's dumb after brandi tells him she killed her husband for allegedly abusing her . \n ( i'd put my pants on in two seconds after that ! ) \nnow , brandi is a psycho bitch , but it's hard not to agree with what she says to darnell during the finale about guys like him treating her like garbage . \none final flaw , though , is letting brandi fall for darnell to begin with . \nbrandi is a classy , intelligent woman with an mba from harvard , who initally resists darnell's \" immature play \" as she calls it , as any woman like her would in real life . \nbut all of a sudden she says yes . \nbut when you listen to darnell's four letter word vocabulary watch his actions , you wonder why such an intelligent woman would fall for a guy like darnell period , much less have such an unhealthy obsession for him ! \nlawrence can be good when he wants to , but in order to prove it , he needs to let other people write and direct his movies . \nlook at this movie . \nfour writers , as a result it's too long ( two hours , when it could've easily worked at ninety minutes ! ) and it has a lot of subplots and characters that appear and disappear as quickly as they came ( which makes me think the writers didn't get along ) , all of which isn't necessary . \nthere are some bright spots , though . \nwhitfield , regina king , della reese , and bobby brown all do what they can with lazily written parts , and they help it out a lot . \nand there are some funny parts ( like , for example , the scene where reese attempts to fight whitfeld for harrassing her son and damaging her property ) , but they're just not enough to sustain the film . \n", "capsule : lesbianism examined in the same hushed and reverential tones reserved for a terminal illness . \npotentially interesting idea made stagy and boring . \nclaire of the moon is such an impossibly serious and sober movie that i was waiting for someone to sneeze , just to break the ice . \nit's a perfect example of what my wife calls an s . f . e . \nmovie , where s . f . e . \nmeans so f * * * ing earnest . \nmovies like this need wit and brashness to be absorbing . \nclaire is one strained speech after another , written delivered with all of the energy and spontenaity of a dmv clerk . \nclaire takes two women , claire and noel , both writers , and throws them together in the same cabin at a women-only writer's retreat . \nclaire wrights light comedy , while noel is a scholarly authority on porn and sexual behavior . \nobviously , the two of them are going to have plenty to talk about , and for the entire one hundred and twelve insufferable minutes of this movie , that's all they do : talk . \nthe movie sets up its ( microscopic ) plot with beat-a-dead-horse-into-glue obviousness . \nthe evening talks at the camp are chaired by a motherly type named maggie , a self-professed lesbian , and when noel owns up to also being a lesbian , claire looks like she's been hit with a sockful of wet sand . \nthe movie then quickly degenerates into lots of scenes where noel glances at claire with significance , and claire looks out over the water reflectively . \n ( ugh ! ) \nthe most amazing thing about the movie is how people so intelligent can talk so much and yet get so little through their thick heads . \nall of this , of course , leads up to a scene of complete inevitability : claire and noel , in a scene that should have come an hour earlier , because then the movie ends without even the benefit of reflection about what's just happened . \nwe never get a hint about how any of this has changed anyone , only how they felt about things that didn't even happen yet . \nthe problem with claire . . . \nis not lesbianism as such , but the leaden way it's handled . \nwhy is it that any \" serious \" ( a better word would be adult or at least thoughtful ) examination of sex in a movie almost always winds up producing a movie that's unwatchably boring ? \nthe way this movie deals with lesbianism , we might as well be watching an overheated docudrama about aids . \nmany other movies have used the same subject in ways that are a thousand times better -- more engaging , more creative , more intellectually and artistically interesting . \nlook at john sayles' lianna , or the interesting and little-seen desert bloom ; both of them have more life and vibrancy than claire . \nwhat this movie needed was a good swift kick in the pants . \n", "the great actor james woods once said ( and i'm paraphrasing ) , \" if sex isn't messy , then you're not doing it right \" . \na truly profound statement , and one that could be made for the entire mad slasher genre ( just replace \" sex \" with \" your mad slasher film \" ) . \nfor those uninformed souls , the mad slasher genre ( or sub-genre ) is a melding of horror and exploitation elements put to the service of a plot that follows an identical outline : a usually masked but always crazed killer stalks and kills attractive teens a la halloween . \nurban legend is a mad slasher flick , but one that is so sanitary , bloodless , and nudity free , that with its irony laden dialogue and beautiful ( though not overly talented ) cast , it more closely resembles an overlong wb television special . \nfor film makers , gore is one of the two weapons they have at their disposal in a stale , fright-free horror movie , as stephen king once said ( again paraphrasing ) \" if you can't scare your audience , gross em' out , if you can't do that , make em' laugh \" . \nalas , urban legend succeeds only at the latter , though not by intention . \ni actually find the fact that this film became a minor success ( $40 million domestic box office gross ) more frightening than anything in it . \nit seems that audiences' tastes have been whittled down to such a degree that any movie even claiming to be scary is given the benefit of the doubt . \nthe promotion for urban legend sure promised thrills , but how can anyone with a three digit iq argue that it provides them . \nunfortunately , these kinds of flicks will continue to be produced because people no longer have expectations ; one idiotic super-hyped blockbuster flick after another has desensitized audiences to the point where films don't need to do anything more than promise a good time without the added pressure of delivering . \nif anyone disagrees i would love for them to explain the box office successes of shit like batman and robin , wild wild west , and godzilla . \nbut forget all that , it goes without saying that mad slasher films ( or any other exploitation off-shoot ) will be made without an ounce of craft ( especially considering the sheer volume that are produced ) . \nallow me to present you with the real fault of the mad slasher film : the lack of enthusiastic exploitation . \nthese flicks aren't harnessed with any lofty aspirations , so why not break free and give your audience a bloody good time ? \nsadly out of the literally hundreds made , i would estimate that maybe three are at all worth while . \nand urban legend would certainly not be included amongst those three . \ndespite its considerable production value and the absence of any boom mics slipping into frame , it is just as awful as any no budget entry in the slasher sweepstakes . \nas far as the possibility of some good natured exploitation urban legend's setting alone offers a myriad of promising possibilities : it takes place on a college campus , which is always an appropriate playground for the crazed killer . \nyou see , the campus is a community made up almost entirely of young people all in the midst of strange hormonal surges percolating beneath the surface . \nall those young people are growing up together , going through all kinds of inexplicable emotional highs and lows , so naturally some weirdness is expected . \nall the better for that elusive crazed killer . \ncoupled with the copious amounts of scantily clad coeds running around , and the introduction of a little exploitation into the proceedings should be a relatively easy task . \nbut alas , urban legend is not only idiotic and clich ? ? full ; it's way too clean , a slasher flick for the whole family with no nudity , little gore , and much stupidity . \nthis is the kind of movie where the killer drags dead victims from the scene of the crime for no reason other than , i dunno , exercise . \nit's the kind of movie where the villain calmly purses a running-like-the-wind-prey , yet still manages to catch that prey through some really awful editing techniques . \nit's the kind of movie where characters run into each other just as a loud clash reverberates on the soundtrack . \ni really wish filmmakers would just retire that whole loud-noise-jump-scare thing . \nyes the audience jumps , momentarily frightened , but wouldn't anyone if a loud sonic boom suddenly infiltrated a quiet room . \ni lost all hope for the possibility of any genuine scares in urban legend about ten minutes in when i caught a glimpse of the killer . \napparently filmmakers are running out of creative ways to disguise their mad slashers . \nin scream it was a ghost mask ( scary enough ) , in i know what you did last summer it was a fisher man's rain slicker ( in the middle of summer no less ) , and in urban legend the disguise sinks to the level of mel brooks parody : the villain wears an oversized parka with a fury hood ( ooh ? ? ? scary ) intended to conceal his/her identity . \nfor urban legend 2 i humbly suggest a donald duck costume . \nthough i must admit , urban legend does have a winning premise for what could have been a somewhat entertaining exploitation film . \nthe film's killer slices and dices comely college students to the tune of famous urban legends ( you know , like the babysitter gets threatening phone calls only to find that they're coming from inside the house ) . \ni won't spoil the surprise as to what urban legends are used , after all the film does offer fine 2 : 00 am cable viewing if you happen to be intoxicated enough . \nsad to say , it doesn't include my favorite urban legend : a fairly graphic antidote concerning richard gere and a very unhappy gerbil . \nnow that would be scary . \nbefore i leave you , i would like to bring to your attention the third most irritating thing about the film ( the first being the lack of craft , the second the lack of exploitation ) -- its characters , all of whom are just about the most annoying group of people i've ever spent an evening with . \nonly jared leto ( looking like a carbon copy of rob lowe from back in the day ) and alicia witt , as the resilient heroine , avoid vexatiousness . \nthe most annoying of the bunch is a tie between noxima girl rebecca gayheart and sitcom star michael rosenbaum , as a supremely irritating lout ( so irritating i actually cheered his painful death , and i am not a cruel person ) . \nironically those aggravating sacks of human waste provide the only entertainment in the film ; if viewed as a vicarious fantasy urban legend can be mildly entertaining . \nafter all this is a movie that features the kind of faux hipsters i can't stand getting slaughtered , which is at least better than watching an entire film about people i can't stand not getting slaughtered . \n", "the premise of turbulence is i'm sure very familiar to us all . \nwe've seen it before in passenger 57 , executive decision , and countless other flicks that are good in there own way . \nyou know , terrorists take over a plane , ask the police on the ground for what they what and so on . \nturbulence starts out with a \" convict \" ray liotta being accused of a crime . \nyou think there is no way he could have done it , he's so open and kind . \nhe is taken in and is subsequently transported on a commerical plane to la . \nthis is already a problem . \nthere is no way that convicts would be transported on the same commercial flight that normal passangers would be on . \nanyway , it is christmas eve and everyone is waiting to get to la and spend christmas eve there . \nwell , convict one manages to stop the flight in its proverbial \" tracks \" and liotta , still as calm as ever , takes the other convict out . \nhe also has eyes for lauren holly , a flight attendent , and seems to grow closer to her . \n \" the plot stops here \" \ni didn't like this movie because it seemed to be a rip off of every other airplane movie i've ever seen . \nat one point , mr . liotta looked exactly like jack nicholson in the shining ( i'm serious ! ) . \nit was like they stole for every other movie down to a \" t \" . \nthe only reason i did not give this 0 stars is because it had some okay stunts . \ndon't even bother ! \n", "a movie laced with a good blend of action , comedy , and a heavy dose of musical celebrity guest appearances sounds pretty gourmet , but even the best ingredients can be thrown together in the wrong way , creating a dismal and unsatisfactory product . \neighteen years after the blues brothers hit theaters , blues brothers 2000 is being unleashed , minus half of its original duo ( the late john belushi ) and nearly all of its original charm . \ndan aykroyd reprises his role ( as well as his co-writing credit ) as elwood blues , the sharp dressed con man who wreaked havoc on a self-proclaimed \" mission from god \" along with his brother jake and their blues brothers band nearly eighteen years ago . \nas we begin , elwood is being released from a state penitentiary along with the news of his brother's death in prison years ago . \ncompletely on his own , elwood decides to trace his roots back to the orphanage where he spent his childhood , only to discover that everyone he has ever known has passed away . \nbut elwood isn't completely without family . \nit seems he has a half-brother of sorts - not a real brother mind you , just the illegitimate child of his bluesman pseudo-father curtis ( cab calloway from the first film ) , who has also passed on . \ndespite inklings from mother superior mary stigmata ( kathleen freeman ) to do otherwise , elwood seeks out his only remaining family in an effort to start up an all new blues brothers band . \nworking as a police commander , cabel chamberlain ( joe morton ) , has an immediate disliking for elwood , who nonchalantly fills cab in on his mother's affair years ago and then goes on to steal his wallet . \nfollowing elwood around is the lonely orphan buster ( j . \nevan bonifant ) , who quickly learns to become a mini-elwood . \nwhen bartender mighty mack mcteer ( john goodman ) joins the group , the blues brothers band is complete , and once again , the group travels the country , crashing cars , blowing things up , and obstructing peace with more than just solid blues rock . \nmeanwhile , cab's personal vendetta against elwood leads him on an impassioned manhunt for his next-to-next-of-kin . \n>from this point , the movie turns into a series of music videos with a few bits of acting in between . \nthose hoping for an interesting and/or funny yarn are given too many musical interludes while those heavily interested in the music are given too much of a story . \nonly the extremely avid blues fans should attempt getting thru these two hours . \nfor those people , it may be worth it , for luckily there is much more music than shoddy attempts at acting , but when the story does intrude upon the festivities , the film is heavily bogged down with unfunny jokes , musicians turned stiff actors , and the pointless 10-year- old buster attempting to add some sort of home alone cuteness to the whole thing . \nappearances by musical legends such as aretha franklin , james brown , eric clapton , and a whole slew of others are the high points of the film , but they also confirm why these people are musicians and not actors . \nblues brothers 2000 is deserving of one whole star simply because if you really , really love this kind of music , you might kind of , sort of like this movie . \nmany , many scenes are nauseatingly unfunny , and if you don't have a passion for very deep blues/rock , you'll be bored out of your skull . \nmuch of this film seems nothing more than aykroyd's self-serving vanity project , but no matter how much fun aykroyd may be having with this , none of the excitement is passed on to the audience . \nand seeing three guys in three-piece suits goofily dancing around with poker faces can only be funny for so long . \nunfortunately , those two seconds are over about fifteen minutes into the film . \n", "if only austin powers : the spy who shagged me had been just half as original , zany , silly and totally enjoyable as its predecessor , it would have easily been one of this summer's biggest pleasures . \nif only . \nin fact , the spy who shagged me is the exact opposite of the original ; instead of refreshing the audience with one clever parody after another , the filmmakers bombard us with used-up , tired jokes taken directly from the first one . \ntake the scene where austin powers ( again played by mike myers , but with only a fraction of the giddy enthusiasm he displayed previously ) confronts a henchmen on the side of a cliff . \nafter being pushed off the ravine , the bad guy is of course assumed dead . \nbut suddenly , we hear a pleading voice coming from down below ; he's only injured . \na similar scene played very well in the original international man of mystery , but here i was insulted by it . \ndid the filmmakers really believe the audience would laugh at a rip-off ? \napparently i overestimated the intelligence of the average movie-goer , considering that the film has pulled in over $200 million in domestic theatrical grosses alone . \ndo i hear the sound of a franchise heading our way ? \nhaving said that , though , i still cannot deny the film its merits . \nthe basic plot was delightfully silly enough to sustain my interest somewhat ; dr . evil ( mike myers , in the second of his three roles ) , having constructed a time machine , goes back to the year 1969 in an attempt to snatch austin power's \" mojo \" ( don't you just love that word ? ) \nwhilst he is cryogenically frozen . \nwhen austin gets wind of this ( after a great intro explaining the absence of elizabeth hurley's vanessa kensington ) , he too travels back in time to re-claim his sexual drive , accompanied by the hot-to-trot felicity shagwell , played by heather graham . \nthis sounds stupid , i know , but in the movie it starts to make some kind of weird , off-the-wall sense , and it worked for me . \nthen there's mini-me ( verne troyer ) , a . . . \npetite clone of myer's dr . evil , exactly 1/8 in size . \ntroyer's persona alone gains the film an extra half-star , contributing to one particularly hilarious scene where he attempts to nibble on his own mini-mr . \nbigglesworth . \njust try to ignore the fact that , at 2'8'' , he would make dr . evil's height rise to just over 21 feet . \nno matter . \nhowever , there are only about four hearty laughs throughout the entire hour and a half ( the most notable being the now infamous tent scene ) , and that just isn't enough to warrant even a minor recommendation . \nif there is in fact an \" austin powers 3 \" , they should just kill off secret agent powers and put the emphasis on dr . evil and mini-me . \nunconventional , yes , but there's no denying that it'd make for a better movie . \n", "in the series of the erotic thrillers that flooded the videoshelves in the early 1990s came this french-canadian co-production by max fischer . \nthe movie is set in paris where its hero , struggling american author david mirkine ( judd nelson , at the time specialised in playing losers and people at the edge of sanity ) suffers a terrible writers bloc . \nhe manages to overcome crisis after beginning romantic relationship with beautiful model anabelle ( laurence treill ) . \nunfortunately , she hangs out in jet set circles , which gradually makes mirkine pathologically jealous . \nher connection with powerful david caravan ( pierce brosnan ) would make mirkine step the line between reason and sanity and put in motion whole series of violent and tragic events . \nalthough few pseudoerotic scenes and some elements of the plot do indeed make this film an erotic thriller , drama would probably be more appropriate genre label . \npacing of the film is simply too slow to thrill the viewers , and those patient enough to sit through its entirety have to wait a long time between any interesting or significant developments . \nlow budget also becomes painfully visible , and physical attributes of laurence treill are the only thing worth watching in this film . \nunfortunately , this film has too little of those supposedly erotic scenes , so those who wanted to watch erotic thriller have all the reasons to feel disappointed . \ninstead , they would have to settle with pointless , slow scenes involving nelson , brosnan and laurence treill's attempts of serious acting . \nall of those definitely not worth

. \" \nsarah michelle gellar , that never-ceasing crusader against never-ending evil every tuesday night on the wb network , here plays a down-on-her-luck chef suspected of dabbling in witchcraft after her flailing restaurant receives help in the form of magically scrumptious meals . \ntaste test results : some vampire slaying , though out of place , would have really livened this excruciating movie up . \n \" simply irresistible \" is actually quite easy to deny , a disaster of culinary and other proportions pretty much from the opening on . \ngellar's amanda finds herself falling for harried henri bendel exec tom ( sean patrick flannery of powder ) around the same time she discovers an uncanny ability to mystically manifest emotions in her cooking , a secret ingredient that arouses both his interest in her and the public's in her tiny tribeca eatery . \nall this love and sorcery have a lot to do with the telekinetic crab that also figures into the story , a tale that at times plays like an american spin on 1993's mexican classic \" like water for chocolate . \" \nseveral differences : one , \" like water \" didn't have a telekinetic crab , and two , \" like water \" was a good film . \n \" simply irresistible , \" on the other hand , is about as challenging as an easy-bake oven . \namateurishly staged scenes cancel each other out in their badness , from an embarrassing seduction in a literal vanilla fog to an impromptu dance sequence where tom and amanda do their best fred and ginger - though fred and ginger never took part in anything this garish . \nthe intrusive musical score distracts from the flat dialogue at regular intervals , but it's not like you're were going to miss much . \nin fact , take away the few instances of salty language and this has made-for-disney channel written all over it . \nbut a majority of \" simply irresistible \" 's resistibility factor has less to do with the afore-mentioned overkill than the bland leads - tom and amanda are so thin and ambiguously defined that there's just no fun rooting for their inevitable \" happily ever after . \" \nnor do the otherworldly powers that serve to bring them together make sense , so we're left with a ho-hum relationship based on enchanted eclairs ; it's not going to last long , people . \nperhaps sensing this , the filmmakers have piled on weird supporting characters for acting vets like betty buckley , dylan baker and patricia clarkson , but they don't go anywhere either . \nin fact , nothing in \" simply irresistible \" goes anywhere save for gellar , and she doesn't go somewhere so much as you wish she'd go _somewhere_ - like to a better movie . \nalready proving major talent with relatively few big- and small-screen roles , she's the sole reason this overcooked souffle isn't completely fit for the garbage disposal , looking smashing in her todd oldham-designed duds and investing much more in her perfunctory part than she ever gets in return . \nit's certainly a dish best not served in it's current condition , but one can only guess that , without gellar , \" simply irresistible \" would be strictly unwatchable . \n", "the 13th warrior reeks so badly of melodrama and poor acting that it carries a worst scent than a canine's least appetizing residue . \nthe best part of the film would be a close contest between the closing credits and a brief moment in the middle where the screen goes entirely white and you hope that the film has slipped and caught ablaze in the projector . \nmy vote goes for the ending credits , where you can start trying to put the awful experience behind you . \nibn fahdlan ( antonio banderas ) is an important official who is banished from his home for sleeping with another man's wife . \nhe encounters a group of norse warriors who convince him to join them on a mysterious journey to be taken by 13 men . \nfahdlan is chosen as the 13th and last warrior in a moment that is so desperately overacted and overdone that numerous persons at the screening i attended broke out into laughter . \nthe movie proves to be a new low point for banderas , who's acting seems closer to that of his role as the lover and caretaker for a dying gay man in 1993's philadelphia , than that of a warrior . \nin the film's supposed pay off scene , he exclaims \" i was wrong , these are not men ! \" , \na line intended to be the most memorable quote of the production . \nunfortunately , banderas delivers it in a fashion that makes chevy chase's career look like oscar material . \nthe film , based on michael crichton's best selling novel , eaters of the dead was shot under that name some three years ago , and after numerous rewrites not only does the dialogue seem completely phony , but the plot is incredibly difficult to follow . \nat the same time , the 13th warrior makes you think about numerous questions . \nquestions like \" why do the characters always have perfect lighting on them even when it is pitch dark ? \" , \n \" why does no one ever have blood cover both sides of their face , but rather just one side ? \" \nand finally , \" will the manager give me a refund ? \" \n90 minutes into the 103 minute film , a man invites of the warriors \" come with me , there is a woman who can help . \" \nunfortunately , there is nothing that could help this film . \nthe most appropriate ending would have been for the 13 men to join hands , form a chorus line , and break into a rendition of \" springtime for hitler . \" \n", "i've heard it called \" jaws with claws \" and that's a fair summation of the plot , though that tag line does little to quantify quality . \ndirector stephen hopkins ( blown away , predator 2 ) and screenwriter william goldman ( maverick , misery ) would have you believe that this is an epic historical drama about man against nature , based on what really happened in africa to the railroad workers trying to build a bridge to the 20th century . \nthey've stacked the deck with two big stars ( val kilmer , michael douglas ) , a bigger production design , beautiful photography ( by academy award winner vilmos zsigmond ) , and a score so overblown that it makes the lion king soundtrack sound like chamber music . \nthe movie doesn't make a lick of sense , though , either as an epic or as your basic boo-fest . \nin fact , some of the bits are so laughably ludicrous that you may think you've stumbled into the sequel to mystery science theater 3000 : the movie . \nhow about the three guys with rifles , who trap a lion and then can't even hit the damned thing ? \nor the ham-on-wry acting of michael douglas , who chews more scenery than the animals ever do ? ? \nor , my favorite , lions so agile that they can even climb onto rooftops ? ! ? \n", "billy crystal reappears in yet another high concept comedy . \nhe tries to infuse some life into it , but it gets bogged down with sentimentality and a lack of sophistication . \nsammy ( billy crystal ) is a struggling agent at the end of his ropes . \nhe's separated from his wife , serena ( kathleen quinlan ) , and down to his last serious client . . . in a low-budget film shooting in

world's greatest . \nmostly , it falls under the category of \" boy . . . he's \nso big ! \" , \nand that can only go so far , no matter how hard the talent tries . \nstill , its slightly amusing parts are longed for when the movie gets bogged down in sappy moments . \nthe film's best moment ( and that's not saying much ) is a bit part by steven seagal , playing himself . \nbetween executive decision and this , all of seagal's best roles have been cameos . \nmaybe he should consider a change of work : steven seagal , the character actor ! \ngheorghe muresan isn't a natural actor at all ,

the giant . \nandre also had a hefty accent , but he displayed a knack for comedy in the princess bride . . . something \nmuresan should have studied for some pointers . \nwhy does billy crystal

authority police . \nthey have a job which could actually be the core of a really interesting movie : one of them plays drunk possum to attract chain-snatchers and the other does lookout . \ni had a whole headful of legal and ethical questions surrounding this , raised by a documentary i'd seen on the subject once , but the movie does not waste any time with being intelligent or thought-provoking

subplot about a maniac who torches token book clerks , * and * a love story , * and * a holdup -- no , two holdups , sorry , easy to lose track in a movie this braindead -- * and * a mob boss who

. \na thriller ? \nthe subplot with the token booth killer is inept , a throwaway that should have been ditched in the rewrite . \na comedy ? \nthe few jokes that do work are wasted . \na drama ? \nall dramatic tension between both principals is freeze-dried and off-the-rack . \nthere's not a moment in the movie where i felt like i was listening to genuine human beings talk ; it's all screenwriterese , that bizarre analect where every sentence ends in a punchline and the primary mode of expression is the unique conjunctions of four-letter words . \n ( actual dialogue excerpt : \" fuck you . \" \n \" what ? \" \n \" you heard me : fuck * you * . \" \n \" no : fuck * you * ! \" ) \nlook . i'll be honest here . \ni've tried writing screenplays , and even * i * suspect that if i

\ni've weasted enough time on this piece of tripe . \n", "alexander dumas' the three musketeers is one of the most often-adapted literary works , and for good reason : the swashbuckler is a legend rather than just a story . \nperhaps the musketeer , a new film that \" reimagines \" the novel in the spirit and style of the matrix , is one adaptation too many . \nit's just awful : spiritless , silly and unforgivably boring , transforming the timeless classic into a mish-mash of old-as-time clich ? s and incoherent , repetitive action sequences . \nthis time , d'artagnan is played by calvin klein model justin chambers , who can't even pronounce his character's name . \nas a boy , he watched his father get killed by febre ( tim roth ) , a lackey of power-hungry cardinal richelieu . \nhe vowed to have vengeance . \nafter undergoing intense training under an expert swordsman , he goes looking for his enemy . \non his quest , he embroils himself in a struggle for control at the highest levels of the french government . \nthe royal musketeers have lost their gusto , what with their jobs being taken over by the cardinal's own guards . \nonly a few loyal swashbuckers remain , among them athos and portos ( who are only figureheads in this movie ) . \ntogether with d'artagnan , they fight to extricate the queen ( catherine deneuve ) from the traps that febre and richelieu are trying to plant . \noh , and as an afterthought , d'artagnan falls in love with the poor maid at the local inn ( mena suvari ) . \njust thought i'd mention that . \nnow , look : i don't know whose idea this was , but whoever is responsible deserves a severe tongue-lashing . \ni have nothing against \" modernizing \" classic works of literature - at the very least , they can inspire viewers to actually read the book - but films as dull as this have no positive side effects . \ndirector peter hyams , known for such masterpieces of modern cinema as timecop and end of days , has jettisoned everything that was great about dumas' masterwork : the sense of excitement , cause , and camaraderie . \ninstead , we get impressively choreographed but somehow vacuous , uninvolving action sequences that emerge from emptiness and lead to nothing . \nwhen the musketeers finally get to holler \" all for one , and one for all , \" i could have sworn that was dumas rolling in his grave that i felt . \nmaybe the reason for the utter lack of suspense here is the hyams's tone , which is unreasonably dark and brooding when you consider the reader's digest condensed version of the story that he gives us . \nit's as though anything that may have been construed as \" fun \" was purposely expunged from the production . \nthe joylessness of the proceedings , from the oppressively shady lighting to the mechanical fight scenes , can be felt in every frame . \nchambers can't act ; suvari , roth and deneuve can , but aren't given the chance . \nand when push comes to shove , the use of stunt doubles is distractingly obvious , though at least roth gets to play a villain without having to wear an ape suit . \nsome movies seem sloppy and careless , clearly made for a quick buck . \nwith the musketeer we get the sense that it was meticulously crafted to be awful . \nthe film is intricate , stylish and precise , hitting the wrong note every single time . \n", "in this re-make of the 1954 japanese monster film , godzilla is transformed into a \" jurassic park \" copy who swims from the south pacific to new york for no real reason and trashes the town . \nalthough some of the destruction is entertaining for a while , it gets old fast . \nthe film often makes no sense ( a several-hundred foot tall beast hides in subway tunnels ) , sports second-rate effects ( the baby godzillas seem to be one computer effect multiplied on the screen ) , lame jokes ( mayor ebert and his assistant gene are never funny ) , horrendous acting ( even matthew broderick is dull ) and an unbelievable love story ( why would anyone want to get back together with maria pitillo's character ? ) . \nthere are other elements of the film that fall flat , but going on would just be a waste of good words . \nonly for die-hard creature feature fans , this might be fun if you could check your brain at the door . \ni couldn't . \n ( michael redman has written this column for 23 years and has seldom had a more disorienting cinematic experience than seeing both \" fear and loathing \" and \" godzilla \" in the same evening . ) \n", "when i first saw the preview for cruel intentions , i turned to my friend and said , \" dangerous liaisons for kids ! \" \nit was clear to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense , owing everything it is to stephen frears' 1988 masterpiece . \nimagine my surprise to see that writer/director roger kumble has given credit to his source material : choderlos de laclos is recognized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses in the opening credits . \nand i was impressed . \nin fact , i was much more impressed with this recognition than with the actual film , which is an appalling excuse for a movie . \nit's kiddie-porn hackwork , complete with earthy sex-talk and fully-clothed hand-jobs . \ni suppose this kind of movie was inevitable ; with all the teen high-school angst movies coming out , there was certainly room for a pretentious and laughable movie about a bunch of teenagers who think they're smarter and more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined . \ncruel intentions is a mess in every possible way , and it fails primarily in the way i expected it to : i hated all the characters , and i hate everything they do . \ni also hate ryan phillippe , so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be . \nphillippe plays ( check out this name ) sebastian valmont . \nwow . \nisn't that a memorable name ? \ni could just say it over and over again . \nsebastian valmont . \nit kind of rolls off the tongue , in the spirit of phrases like sanguine vapors and velvet sandwich . \nsebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth ; there is no woman he can't have , no material object out of his reach . \nhe has all the money , all the sex -- all at his fingertips . \nand , luckily , his parents never enter into his life -- no , in the world of cruel intentions , adults don't really exist . \nthe ones who do are irritating . \nsebastian valmont lives with his stepsister , kathryn merteuil ( sarah michelle gellar ) , the bitch-queen of the universe , and also the woman every man wants . \nsince these two rich kids are so bored , they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaisons . \nkathryn wants sebastian valmont to de-virginize cecile caldwell ( selma blair ) , a naive dork-chick who has somehow wronged kathryn . \nbut it's too easy for sebastian valmont -- he wants to nail annette hargrove ( reese witherspoon ) , the \" paradigm of chastity and beauty . \" \nso , sebastian valmont and kathryn make a deal ( which is too explicit to state here ) . \nbut -- dear god ! \n-- sebastian valmont actually begins to fall for poor annette hargrove . \ndangerous liaisons is a great movie because the characters are all believable , and because of its masterful acting . \ncruel intentions is bad for many reasons , but it lacks both believable characters and masterful acting . \nkathryn merteuil is simply a hateful witch , a girl so loathsome that i would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her . \nshe is supposed to be mean , but glenn close gave the character some depth in dangerous liaisons . \ngellar , while aesthetically pleasing , is one-dimensional and utterly repulsive . \nwitherspoon has a truly beautiful face , but her character isn't the moral staple she's supposed to be : sure , she won't have sex until she's in love ( is this really a * moral * issue ? ) , but she does some things in the last few scenes that are more than a little reprehensible . \nbut i can't forget mr . phillippe , who continues to exceed my expectations with his impenetrable , invulnerable blandness . \ni have to give him credit and say that he did , in fact , manage to change his facial expression about three times during the course of cruel intentions . \nand there's one point in the film in which he shouts , thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone . \ntrue , he is bad , but it doesn't help that he has no character to work with . \nkumble has drained all the interesting aspects from this character , leaving us with a sex-crazed lunatic who is supposed to be sympathetic because he falls in love with a moral flower and shuns the wicked bitch . \nthe film fails in every other way , too . \nfirst of all , nobody talks like this . \neven the \" intellectuals \" i know don't bother with this kind of pointless and pretentious yammering . \nfor a while , the movie looks like it might play itself for laughs , but it ends up taking itself so seriously that there's no way we can join it . \ncruel intentions also manages to come off as soft-porn in more than one scene . \nearlier i mentioned a fully-clothed hand-job ; this occurs between kathryn and sebastian valmont , both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point in the movie . \nso , if we hate them , then what's the point of an extended sex scene ? \ntitillation , of course . \nit can't even work under the pretense of \" meaningful love scene , \" because we hate the characters . \nit's interesting to note some of the parallels between cruel intentions and dangerous liaisons . \nkumble is clearly familiar with the earlier film ; many of the scenes have a similar tone , and there are moments in frears' film that kumble imitates almost completely ( such as the last scene , in which [spoiler warning ! ] the antagonist is humiliated in front of her peers ) . \nbut kids don't act like this . \nnobody acts like this . \nin his translation , roger kumble forgot character development and sympathy -- some pretty crucial elements . \nthe result is a picture of confounding badness , a kiddie-porn mess that thinks it's really deep and profound . \ni'll give cruel intentions credit for realizing its influences , but that doesn't change the fact that it's awful . \n", "everyone knows that old rule , 'never work with children and animals . ' \nin this latest horror flick mimic case , it's 'never work with children and genetically enhanced killer animals' instead , as mimic features both of these and succeeds in doing nothing except mildly engaging the audience . \nthe film begins in new york , where we see children dying from a mysterious disease , which is being carried by cockroaches . \ndr . susan tyler ( sorvino ) creates a genetically enhanced bug ( the 'judas' breed ) , however , which is designed to kill all cockroaches . \nthe bug does it's job , the cockroaches all die , and the terror is gone . \n'three years later' appears on the screen , and we discover that the judas breed is back , bigger than ever , and ready to kill . \nthe spin on this bug , however , is that it can mimic it's predator , and in this case . . . . it's \nhumans . \nthat should teach us for squishing all those bugs . \nwhat should be a roller coaster ride with bugs everywhere , tons of gory deaths and some massive set pieces instead turns out to be a rather subdued , almost boring movie which plods along at a very slow pace . \nperhaps the movie was trying to be thought provoking , and trying to avoid the 'predator' type movie it could easily have become . \nif it is , then the director and writers have made the wrong move , because this is perfectly suited to be an all out action fest . \nthe director , who bought us cronos , a far superior film , directs the film in a calm , and frankly dull movie . \nthere are few exciting sequences , instead just a lot of people talking . \nif the dialogue was intelligent , then it would be all right , but it's sadly babbling nonsense . \nin fact , the script is embarrsingly weak , and the characterizations not much better . sorvino and company are as 2d as characters come , with the script not bothering to develop them . \nthere is some action in this film , but it's directed in such an annoying way , it's just infuriating to watch . \nthe camera cuts all over the place , disoreitating the audience , and instead of involving the audience in the action , it merely alienates them . \nthe peformances are o . k , if slightly below average . \nsorvino is o . k , although she's not very good at conveying terror , or anything emotion really . \nthe supporting cast are all sterotypes , with characters such as a big black security guard with a foul mouth , a geeky scientist with spectacles , and what could be the most stereotypical mexican 'old timer' ever . \ntheir reasonable good fun , however . \nmimic , then , may fail with it's story , pacing and characters , but the film does look good . \nlike dark city , mimic is a definite case of style of content . \nit may be a bit too gloomy for it's own good , but the sets look nice , and parts of the film are directed well . \nbut looks aren't good enough to save mimic from the depths of mediocre , somewhere where it shouldn't really belong . \na good opportunity , then , wasted . \na shame . \noverall rating= review by david wilcock ? 1998 \n", "this movie tries to present itself as the sequel to jan de bont's debut as a director , 1994 surprise hit speed . \nbut the only thing the two movies have in common is sandra bullock as the female lead . \nannie ( sandra bullock ) is in the wrong place at the wrong time again . \nshe's going on a cruise with her new boy-friend alex ( jason patric ) , and of course it is her ship that is kidnapped by john geiger ( willem dafoe ) who has a bone to pick with the shipping line . \nthey sacked him after he got sick . \nnow he wants the diamonds stored in the ship's safe for compensation . \nthat actually is the whole storyline . \nspeed 2 could do without dialogues . \nthe movie is all about images and remarkable sound . \ni don't really know why this is called an action movie . \nexcept for a few scenes that are vaguely reminiscent of speed this goes along the lines of the desaster movies of the 70ies . \nfirst we are introduced to a number of people who are going to be important later on in the movie . \nthen desaster strikes . \nsandra bullock was said to have been glad that she could take action this time around . \ni looked for the \" action \" but couldn't find it . \nmost of the time she is part of the decoration . \nthe only time she is part of what happens is when she can have a shot at defusing a bomb and freeing some passengers trapped behind a fire door . \nnow we know that she can handle a chain saw . \nwe also know that fire doors on cruise ships can be cut apart in seconds . \nthe bomb defusal of course goes wrong , but only the furniture is damaged , not our heroes who still are needed . \njason patric alias alex spends most of his time flirting with annie , helping other passengers and frolicking in the water . \nhis initial sea-sickness is suddenly gone , because there are ship , crew and passengers to be saved from evil geiger . \nhe does a pretty good job but i can't blame keanu reeves for declining this part . \nthen there's willem dafoe , the villain , who desperately tries to look as frightening as frankenstein's monster . \nhe doesn't succeed , though . \nan untidy appearance isn't enough to convince the viewer of his psychopath potential . \nbefore he tries again to make us believe he is a dangerous man he should practise for a while in front of a mirror . \ni can't really recommend speed 2 . you will probably like the movie if you like funny situations that aren't meant to be funny . \nespecially the showdown , when the ship first runs into an oil tanker and then dissembles a whole village is a treat . \nthere you get to see the most superfluous scene in the movie . \nin keeping with last year's desaster movie tradition a dog is miraculously saved from certain death . \na really funny ( and meant to be funny ) scene takes place on the oil tanker right before the collision . \nsome crew members watch two ships colliding in an old movie . \nhad they looked out the window they wouldn't have missed the huge ship racing toward them . \nthose of you who still want to see the movie should pick a theater with a large screen and a good sound system to enjoy the visual effects and the phantastic surround sound effects . \nin an adequately equipped theater it's as if the explosion were going off all around you and you can feel the seats vibrate . \nbut the ilm special effects can't save the movie . \nfor all the money they could have done better . \n", "it's tough to be an aspiring superhero in champion city . \njust ask mr . furious ( ben stiller ) , the blue raja ( hank azaria ) , and the shoveler ( william h . macy ) . \nthey're trying to break into the biz , but captain amazing ( greg kinnear ) , the city's hero numero uno , hogs all the action . \nthe good captain has his own problems . \nbecause he's all but eliminated crime , amazing's endorsement deals are falling through . \nthe public craves a major slugfest , so amazing engineers the parole of his one-time arch enemy casanova frankenstein ( geoffrey rush ) . \nfrankenstein succeeds beyond expectations ; he captures capt . amazing before setting out on his scheme to destroy the city . \nso , no one is left to save the day but our would-be superheroes , but their abilities are more \" little league \" than \" justice league . \" \nthe raja hurls forks at foes , the shoveler hits them with a shovel , and mr . furious just yells at people ( stiller is doing essentially the same character he played in a guest appearance on \" friends \" ) . \nafter a painful first strike , the guys hold auditions for teammates and add the bowler ( janeane garofalo ) , who carries her dead father's skull in her bowling ball ; invisible boy ( kel mitchell ) , who can only use his powers when no one is looking at him ; the spleen ( paul reubens ) , who blows devastating winds from his rear ; and the sphinx ( wes studi ) , a mysterious figure who will teach them to fight . \n \" mystery men \" boasts one of the most talented and eclectic casts ever assembled . \nin addition to those already mentioned , the credits include lena olin as frankenstein's evil shrink , comedian eddie izzard and the fugees' prakazrel michel as disco-themed thugs , singer tom waits as an inventor of superhero weapons , artie lange ( from \" mad tv \" ) as another thug , claire forlani ( from \" meet joe black \" ) as a waitress mr . furious is pursuing , louise lasser ( from \" mary hartman , mary hartman \" ) as the blue raja's mother , and actor/magician ricky jay as capt . amazing's manager . \nthe cast includes four oscar-nominated actors ! \nwhen i saw the list of players early last year , i figured the result would be a can't-miss comedy . \nyet , i must report disappointment . \nthe script is probably the worst of 1999 . \nnearly every joke misfires . \nthe stabs at comic books are too obvious to be funny . \n ( for example , no one can recognize capt . amazing in his secret identity because he's wearing glasses . ) \nthe fart jokes surrounding the spleen are surprisingly the only gags that work . \nthe cast tries hard , especially hank azaria , whose character adopts an effete british accent while in costume , but the script is just too lame to run . \n", "8mm , written by seven scribe andrew kevin walker , has an interesting idea which is ruined by hollywood formula to become a bog standard murder mystery . \nnicolas cage plays family man detective tom welles , who is asked by upper class toff mrs . christian ( myra carter ) to investigate an movie found in her recently deceased husbands safe . \nthe movie happens to be an mythical 'snuff movie' , where the girl featured in the film appears to get brutally slashed . \nall mrs . christian wants to know if the girl in the film was killed or not . \nwelles agrees , and soon gets pulled into the seedy underworld of porn movies , with video clerk max california ( phoenix ) as his guide . \nalthough the 'snuff' industry hasn't really been examined in mainstream cinema , 8mm still makes a rather plodding thriller which just seems to be a bit sicker than most . \nthe snuff movie within the movie is certainly disturbing , although the jerky camera angles and grainy image takes some of the shock away . \n8mm has the problem of not wanting to shock too much , and apart from a few moments , most of the action in the film is nothing you haven't seen from another standard thriller . \nthe cast help towards the entertainment , apart from an hideous performance by the increasingly lazy nicolas cage . \nwhile he was fun and breezy in earlier films such as raising arizona ( 1987 ) , ever since leaving las vegas ( 1995 ) , cage has lost much of his acting talent and appears to be on autopilot , such as in the terrible snake eyes ( 1998 . ) \nhere , in 8mm , he's boring , uninteresting and has a dull monotonous voice . \nand in this overlong thriller , these virtues do not help keep the suspense up . \nonly when cage is onscreen with the excellent phoenix does the film start moving , as phoenix is a true talent . \nhis performance is a great break away from the gloom , and he's just purely enjoyable to watch . \ncatherine keener is completely wasted as cage's wife , although she delivers a far better performance than her character deserves . \nher character , though , is hugely underwritten , one of the most wasted characters of the year . \nalso fun is fargo's peter stormare as the wildly over the top snuff film director . \nas this film is written by the person behind seven , 8mm is filled with doom and gloom , and no-one appears to know how to use an light switch . \nunlike seven , 8mm isn't too clever , and the twist is pathetic and startlingly obvious when it arrives . \nlacking the strong characters seven featured , 8mm ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise , and relies on the graphic scenes to provide any entertainment . \nbut director joel schumacher , the completely wrong guy for the job , puts style over content , and while the direction and look are good , it's just not very disturbing . \nschumacher also has no idea how to shock and audience , and though we are meant to be looking at the 'dark belly' of the porn industry , it doesn't exactly leave an haunting impression on the viewers mind , which misses the point . \nalso , the last 20 minutes are so hackneyed , so cliched , it's amazing to think it's the same film you're watching . \n8mm is far from an success , a 'snuffed' opportunity . \nwith a boring lead character , 'controversial' scenes that manage not to be controversial , and a director obsessed with looks , what could have been one of the most shocking films of the year is a dumb thriller . \nultimately , 8mm is probably worth renting on home video , unless your desperate to see what the snuff film within the film looks like . \nand trust me , the rest of the 2 hours are not worth it .

tremors ; i even giggled at last year's critically-savaged big-underwater-snake yarn anaconda . \nsomething about these films causes me to lower my inhibitions and return to the saturday afternoons of my youth , spent in the company of ghidrah , the creature from the black lagoon and the blob . \ndeep rising , a big-undersea-serpent yarn , doesn't quite pass the test . \nsure enough , all the modern monster movie ingredients are in place : a conspicuously multi-ethnic/multi-national collection of bait . . . excuse \nme , characters ; an isolated location , here a derelict cruise ship in the south china sea ; some comic relief ; a few cgi-enhanced gross-outs ; and at least one big explosion . \nthere are too-cheesy-to-be-accidental elements , like a sleazy shipping magnate ( anthony heald ) who also appears to have a doctorate in marine biology , or a slinky international jewel thief ( famke janssen ) whose white cotton tank top hides a heart of gold . \nas it happens , deep rising is noteworthy primarily for the mechanical manner in which it spits out all those ingredients . \na terrorist crew , led by squinty-eyed mercenary hanover ( wes studi ) and piloted by squinty-eyed boat captain finnegan ( treat williams ) , shows up to loot the cruise ship ; the sea monsters show up to eat the mercenary crew ; a few survivors make it to the closing credits . \nand up go the lights . \nit's hard to work up much enthusiasm for this sort of joyless film-making , especially when a monster moview should make you laugh every time it makes you scream . \nhere , the laughs are provided almost entirely by kevin j . o'connor , generally amusing as the crew's fraidy-cat mechanic . \nwriter/director stephen sommers seems most concerned with creating a tone of action-horror menace -- something over-populated with gore-drenched skeletons , something where the gunfire and special effects are taken a bit too seriously . \ndeep rising is missing that one unmistakable cue that we're expected to have a ridiculous good time , not hide our eyes . \ncase it point , comparing deep rising to its recent cousin anaconda . \nin deep rising , one of the creature's victims is regurgitated back into view , partially digested and still alive . \nhe shrieks in horror at his freakish appearance and pain , in a moment a bit too disturbing to be laughable . \nin anaconda , we also see a regurgitated victim , partially digested and still alive . \nhe looks at another character . . . and \nwinks . \nmake no mistake , deep rising has anaconda beat all to heck when it comes to technical proficiency and pacing . \nit's also gloomy , uninspired and not nearly enough fun . \ni don't ask much of my monster movies , but i do ask that they act like monster movies . \nyou don't have to show me a fantastically impressive , massive beast with tentacles a-flailing . \njust show me the massive beast burping , and i'll figure you get the point . \n", "renee

whom discovered the comet ) , and a team of astronauts on the ship `messiah' to save the world . \nfirstly , there is nothing outstandingly inferior about the making of the film ( nor is there anything outstandingly good about it ) , but the plot holes make the film corny and stupid . \nto be honest , i was more moved by the trailer than the film itself ( which isn't saying much ) . \nmimi leder's follow-up to `the peacemaker' is equally incompetent , with all the big stars wasted . \n ( perhaps i'm just annoyed that the release of `the peacemaker' in the us overshadowed a far superior thriller , `the assignment' . ) \nit is very obvious that the title not only represents the big boom that will result from the collision , but also connotes the heavy impact on human lives . \nhowever , the film simply fails on that note . \nthe effects are worn-out , the substandard screenplay limited the acting , and the director continued her sad run in terms of good-film-making credentials . \nshe's still making good money though . \nt ? a leoni's unfortunate character , the news reporter , is the foundation of the story and of the cast . \nbut the film suffers from too many characters that do not need to be explored . \nrobert duvall's aging astronaut is lifeless , and morgan freeman's president is restricted to , well , a righteous president ( which means he's not interesting at all ) . \nleoni's character is the only appealing one , and is played with reasonable conviction ( but a rather peculiar showing when reporting for msnbc ) , but was definitely undervalued by the director and screenwriters . \nwarning : spoilers included ( but a lot of it is irrelevant and predictable anyway ) . \nplot holes , plot holes , plot holes . \nnow , e . l . e . \nis threatening to

out that only a few percent of the world population actually perish , and those less selfish ones ( the ones that stayed at home ) were the victims . \nthe film was almost mocking them , telling them they had died for nothing . \ni also fail to see how two teenagers , carrying a baby , would be the first to climb up the mountain/hill , even with a motorbike for a head-start . \nit's unlikely that the dust will take just two years to settle , but that doesn't really matter . \nbuilding caves was a strategy mentioned in `dr . \nstrangelove' , which proposed that people lived underground for one hundred or so years . \nnow that is a more practical use for caves . \nwhat is the point of living in caves ? \nthere is no , unlike `dr . \nstrangelove' , any radioactivity outside to restrict exposure . \nhow do plants grow ? \nif humans have the technology to keep plants alive in caves , there's no reason why they can't do it in the open . \nthe president disclosed that other countries have been preparing their own caves . \nobviously this means that the other countries were informed a long time ago , and you can't be serious to say that nobody leaked the news to the media . \nin an important mission like that of the `messiah' , for that matter any mission , it is impossible that isn't sufficient fuel for an extra couple of hundred metres , needless to say tens of kilometres .

about his life , although well written , puts too much make-up on a man whose life was probably more pork and potatoes , rather than lobster and champagne . \noh well , let's fantasise onwards an assume that he was a bit of a flirtatious play-write , who falls in love with a beautiful woman ( gwyneth paltrow ) and from her inspiration , several plays develop - ? romeo and juliet' , and ? the

\ni think not . \nas for the oscars were they deserved by this movie ? \ni think not . \nin many aspects ? private ryan' and ? life is beautiful' were far superior movies , but one should never assume that this should be a criteria for winning an oscar , as time and again , for reasons unexplained , an undeserving movie will win the accolade . \nanother sore point is the fact that gwyneth won the

than you can shake a stick at . \nthere's so much pointless sci-fi banter it's too much to take . \nthe galaxy here is a total rip-off of the \" star wars \" universe the creators don't bother filling

' \ngeneral thade ( tim roth , \" lucky numbers \" ) is of the opposite opinion , wishing for declaration of martial law that will allow him to annihilate the race . \nhe's sweet on ari . \nit's relatively easy to see where this 'new' story is going from the onset , yet its ultimate revelation has gaping logic holes . \nthe much ballyhooed 'surprise' ending is a nonsensical let down . \nan attempt at a love triangle , conveyed by ari and the human daena ( estella warren , \" driven \" ) giving each other 'back off' looks over leo , fails because he never develops a relationship with either of them . \nthe lone sex scene is some hilarious foreplay between elder orangutan senator nado ( glenn shadix ) and his trophy wife nova ( burton's squeeze , lisa marie ) . \nguffaws will also likely greet charlton heston's cameo as thade's father , the one ape harboring a firearm ( ! ) who sputters some very familiar lines before dying . \nthe only real success of the 2001 \" planet of the apes \" is rick baker's makeup , and even that's an iffy affair . \nno attempt was made to change the human whiteness of the actors' eyes , a real distraction amidst some otherwise impressive work . \nroth , warner and michael clarke duncan ( as thade's right hand man attar ) are given the most impressive makeovers . \ngiamatti looks more like a skull than an ape and the female apes are too humanized to be given sexual appeal . \ntim roth delivers the most impressive acting job by getting the body language right - his nasty chimpanzee character leaps about , most spectacularly when mounting his steed , but even's he's undone by some obvious wire work . \nbonham carter delivers a goodly range of emotion from behind a stiff prosthetic , but is undone in turn by the silliness of the writing . \nmost of the film has a set bound look which no amount of mist can cover . \nthe ape's city resembles a dank complex of tree houses . \nthe apes' military costumes ( colleen atwood , \" sleepy hollow \" ) as well as their field tents are reminiscent of eiko ishioka's work on coppola's \" dracula . \" \nthat oriental flavor is also found in danny elfman's tribal , percussive score .

pouring concrete under the texas sun . \nharder than building a bridge over troubled waters . \nand incidentally , a whole heck of a lot harder than writing a movie review . \nthrillers are all variations on a theme . \nyou have a smart , resourceful , and powerful bad guy , who has a goal he has to meet . \nyou have a noble and brave good guy , who has to protect the innocent , kill the bad guy , and not get killed himself in the process . \nthe trick of thriller writing is doing all of this in an interesting and novel manner . \nthis simple formula can lead to classic movies like north by northwest , high noon , or silence of the lambs , or big summer blockbusters like men in black , the fugitive , or air force one , or it can lead to utter dreck like masterminds , event horizon , kull the conqueror . . . . \nis anyone else getting depressed here ? \npoint is , it's not enough to follow the formula . \nyou've got to throw in something extra , something good and new and better than the last version . \nsomething to surprise and move all of us people who buy the tickets and the popcorn and the happy meals . \nthis is a hard thing to do , but it is absolutely necessary in every way . \nwithout that something extra -- whether it's a great plot or a well-written screenplay , or great special effects or great locations or great casting or great performances or great big hungry dinosaurs -- the movie fails . \nthat's why the jackal , with all its starpower , with all its budget , with all its hype , gets a big fat f . \nbruce willis is the bad guy , the jackal , a

gere be able to stop the assassination in time and kill the jackal ? \n ( i'll give you three guesses , and the first two don't count . ) \nthere are no surprises awaiting the audience in the jackal , no moment when you say to yourself , \" i wonder what happens next ? \" \nthe script for the jackal isn't ripped straight from today's headlines . \nit's ripped off , straight from an episode of millennium . \nthroughout the movie , we learn what the jackal's plans are and how he intends to accomplish them . \nno surprise . \nthe fun of a movie like this should come from richard gere figuring out what the jackal's plan is and developing a clever plan to foil the bad guy . \ninstead , we get two ( count 'em , two ) scenes where gere is sitting in an fbi conference room somewhere and instantly divines the jackal's plan just as if he's frank black ( or more likely , just as if he's been handed a copy of the script ) . \nand we never get more than a superficial clue as to why gere has had this flash of insight . \nit's like gere's character is psychic , but neither he nor the fbi ( or the screenwriters ) seem to know it . \nand just like in millennium , the bad guy has an overwhelming need to go after the people the good guy cares about , whether or not they are important to what he's trying to do or not . \nwhat's more , in the last half of the movie , the jackal , supposedly a super-smart professional terrorist who never makes a mistake , comes down with a major case of the stupids . \nas for the performances . . . \nbruce willis manages to get through the whole movie without a wisecrack , which is a major achievement , but not enough reason to see the movie . \nhis disguises are good , but not as good or as interesting as val kilmer's in the saint . \nrichard gere is made to talk the entire movie in an irish accent , which detracts from his otherwise lifeless and dull performance . \nsidney poitier is probably the most disappointing element in a overwhelmingly disappointing movie -- not that his performance is bad or anything , it's not , but it is sad that hollywood won't use this talented actor in any part other than an fbi agent ( shoot to kill , sneakers ) . \nwriting a good plot and a good screenplay , like i said , is hard , but it can be done . \nit wasn't done here . \nit is our job as consumers to reward good screenplays and to denounce bad and uninteresting ones . \ndo not go see this movie . \nyou'll only encourage the producers to make more just like it . \ninstead , stay home and rent day of the jackal , or in the line of fire , or a fire safety video , for crying out loud . \nanything other than the jackal , which lives up to its name by gnawing the dead bones of other , better movies . \n", "all right , all right

writers , not campaign managers ; it's that carville and matalin's story is actually interesting . \nspeechless is a limp , poorly structured would-be romantic comedy . \nspeechless is set during a

including julia's stud-reporter fiance ( christopher reeve ) and a series of stunts which continue to prove that all's fair in love and politics . \nthe standard formula for a movie like speechless

kevin and julia into each other's arms in the first fifteen minutes , then developing the antagonism . \nit's a noble attempt to shake things up , but unfortunately it just doesn't work . \npart of the fun of watching sparring in a romantic comedy comes from recognizing the chemistry even before the characters do , but in speechless they already know they're attracted to each other , and we're left with waiting for the campaign to end so they'll admit that they love each other already . \nthere is such a herky-jerky feel to the constant bickering and making up that even king's sharp dialogue can't prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour . \ninconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the performances of geena davis and michael keaton , and with those performances most of their scenes together . \nthe problems begin with their initial courtship , which does virtually nothing to establish julia's character and merely establishes that kevin is a wise-ass . \ndavis is radiantly beautiful , and keaton is generally entertaining , but these characters are so plastic that nothing that happens to them seems to matter one bit . \nin a couple of scenes , like a quiet moment sitting at a fountain , they actually achieve some measure of connection . \nfor the most part , however , they're just actors spouting lines . \nyou keep waiting for a little spark , and it never happens . \nperhaps most disappointing is that king and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from speechless's politics . \nthe setting seems perfect for a high- energy battle of the sexes with partisanship thrown into the mix , but that's never the tone that underwood is going for . \nhe wants a warm , fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaiman's flute-and-wind musical score , and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between kevin and julia fades into the background . \nit might as well have been a story about rival grocers , and every single character is about as uninspired as he or she could possibly be . \ni was about the only reviewer in the civilized world who seemed to enjoy robert king's previous screenplay , the dana carvey flop clean slate , so i had some hopes for speechless . \nbut while there is wit in the words , this is a script which was probably much better on paper . \non screen , it's still paper thin . \n", "teenagers have a lot of power in hollywood . \nevery year countless films will be made targeting that audience in particular , and rely on the entire teenage population to turn out on friday and saturday nights , wallets in hand . \nthe formula is very simple , you make a film with a big name young actor or actress with sex appeal . \nyou add a high school environment that features everyone from prom queens to math club nerds , and then a very simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in 90 minutes , the typical teenage attention span . \nthe response is enormous as this part of the population will waste it92s money on almost any = film set in an environment they can relate to , and , most importantly , they don92t care to judge films=92 quality , so any piece of trash will = due . \nthat is just what never been kissed , the latest film from director raja gosnell , is ; trash . \njosie geller ( drew barrymore ) is the youngest copy editor in the history of the chicago sun times . \nshe has her own personal assistant , unlimited supplies , and her own office . \nbut she is very much dismayed with her position in life . \nthere is nothing she wants more than to be a reporter and go out into the field , where she can play a more active role in the chicago media . \nso when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her out of nowhere , she jumps at it with elation . \nconstantly smothering josie in the work place is her friend anita ( molly shannon ) and her amicable superior , gus ( john c . reilly ) . \nthe two of them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first assignment , as they both deem her to be an office worker and not a reporter . \nhowever , since this film is aimed at a teenage audience with little patience for character conflict , this otherwise interesting scenario is resolved within two minutes , and josie is headed for the field . \nobviously , the field assignment involves a high school . \nspecifically , she is to become an undercover reporter at a high school , by enrolling in the senior class and \" becoming one of them . \" \ni don92t think that i = need to even begin to explain all the impossibilities of this situation ever occurring , so i won92t . \nthe movie develops into josie trying to find the life that she never led in high school . \ninterwoven flashback scenes show us just how much of a dork she truly was , and she appears to be heading down that road again . \nfortunately for this lame production , other characters do appear that make some of these high school scenes both humorous and remotely interesting . \nthey include the predictable love stories , between both a student ( jeremy jordan ) and a teacher ( michael vartan ) , to show that josie is really two people in one body . \nalso , her younger brother and opposite , rob ( david arquette ) comes into her new found life and even causes a rare scene that is mildly provocative . \nthe humor found in this film is actually quite amusing . \ntypical for teenage films , it is chalk full of sexual innuendoes and condom humor . \none scene in particular features a certain classroom activity involving bananas and latex that is absolutely hysterical . \nmost of the other jokes are straight forward high school humor that anyone who has ever been to high school can appreciate and will enjoy . \nbut those still don92t = recover for the total lack of quality in this movie . \nfollowing this trend of high school movie rules , comes the general acting . \nit is even worse than the trend of overplaying a scenario from film to film . \nin this case , drew barrymore is absolutely painful to watch . \nshe is required to play her character on two levels , having some very black and white transitions . \nand although some scenes are written to be particular shades of gray , she seems to hold that color throughout all of her screen time . \nat one point she is alone with an obvious love interest on a ferris wheel , and is expected to him on an adult level , since he is one , her teacher . \nbut she never seems to get out of the gray area , and in doing so she makes a mockery out of his otherwise good performance . \nfollowing barrymore is the pitiful molly shannon ( saturday night live ) . \nshe seems to be limited to playing an ecstatic character that no one can relate to , and draws the attention of an audience as simply unrealistic . \nit is these \" qualities \" that prevent the aforementioned condom scene from being one of the few decent . \nluckily there is one great performance to emerge out of this otherwise bleak film . \ndavid arquette ( scream ) takes home the prize for being able to stand out in an ensemble performance that is absolutely pathetic , and not have his brilliant acting ruined . \nand as a central character he gets to take on his own mini-plot , which is one of the few well done parts of never been kissed . \nin a dazzling cherry-on-the-sundae type piece of work , he does an absolutely hilarious tom cruise impression from the 1983 hit , risky business . \nnever been kissed is a mediocre film at best . \nthe predictable plot has become so overplayed in hollywood , that it is sickening to watch time and again , and this film is no exception . \nthe acting is just as bad , but there is the one positive presence of david arquette to add some light . \nunfortunately , the bottom line is that the movie will be a success , because teenagers will pay to see any trash . \n", "walken stars as a mobster who is kidnapped and held for ransom by four bratty rich kids . \nit seems that a woman has also been kidnapped--she is the sister of one of them ( e . t . 's \nhenry thomas ) and the girlfriend of another ( flannery ) --and the asking price is $2 million , which said snots are unable to cough up alone . \nthey even cut off walken's finger to show they mean business , because they are desperate to save the woman's life . \nsuicide kings is a terrible film . \nwalken aside , there isn't a single appealing cast member . \no'fallon creates characters that are functional types without any resonance . \nin an amusingly unironic scene , walken plays poker with the foursome and describes each of their personalities to a tee--it's as if he was reading the summary sheet for a casting director . \nthe plot is another issue entirely . \no'fallon is someone whom i'm betting has seen reservoir dogs and the usual suspects too many times , for not only does his story veer off on bizarre tangents from whence they never return ( do we really need the scene where dennis leary beats up an abusive father with a toaster , which is entirely unrelated to both the story and leary's character , or the numerous anecdotal sequences ? ) , but the central plot itself is a serpentine mess , filled with crosses and double crosses and triple crosses . . . \nby the fourth big revelation/twist , i had completely tuned out , wondering what on earth attracted these actors to the material . \nrecently a peer , a fellow young filmmaker , informed me that he had an idea for a movie about four guys , the mob , and the fbi . \nit occurred to me then what's wrong with indies like suicide kings : i suspect o'fallon has never met a mobster , is not a rich man , doesn't deliver endless \" clever \" monologues to his friends about his favourite types of boots . . . \nin short , these guys are just riffing on other movies , and in doing that , making the same film over and over and over again . \ntarantino found his niche and now hundreds of genxers with movie cameras are trying to find tarantino's niche instead of carving their own . \n-reviewed at the toronto international film festival \n", ">from writer and director darren stein comes jawbreaker , the poorly told tale of what can happen when an innocent birthday prank goes wrong . \nat reagan high , four girls are sitting on top of the world . \ncourtney shane , played by rose mcgowan , holds the title of meanest , most disrespectful soul in the school . \neveryone hates her , but everyone envies her due to her popularity . \ncourtney is the \" leader \" of her clique , which also includes julie , played by rebecca gayheart , liz purr , played by charlotte roldan , and marcie , played by julie benz are the other three in the group . \nit is liz's seventeenth birthday , and julie , courtney , and marcie concur that they will play a seemingly innocent prank on her , but the prank results in the death of liz . \njust like stupid teens in any teen directed film such as this one , the foursome decide to cover up the death to make it look like a murder committed by someone else . \nand also just like in other teen directed movies , one of the four don't agree with hiding it , this time that character being julie . \nand finally , just like in other teen movies , there is a witness outside the group trying to hide the truth . \nthis time that character being fern mayo ( judy greer ) , who is subject to many cracks from courtney's group , as well as the entire school . \n>from here , jawbreaker turns into a predictable tale of revenge , bad morals , and at least trying to do the right thing . \nnot only is the script weak , on a whole the acting is horrid thanks to a large amount of the main cast . \njudy greer is undeniably awful as her one dimensional , annoying character , as she overacts every line she has . \nalso on the bad side of acting is julie benz , almost falling to the annoying factor that greer delivers . \non the positive side of acting , rose mcgowan performs well here , but doesn't match her wickedly clever performance as \" tatum \" , in 1996's scream . \nmcgowan's role is annoying , but this only adds to the film . \nshe is wickedly mean , and even though she a well-written character , you downright hate her . \nfaring even better than mcgowan is rebecca gayheart , who is always exceptionally believable as her roles . \nwhen the script feeds her a one or two dimensional character , she turns it into three , always putting strong emotion and power into her roles . \ngayheart isn't given as much to do here as she was in 1998's urban legend , but you can still get a strong taste of her acting skills in jawbreaker . \njawbreaker drifts and mianders different sub plots throughout , hardly throwing anything for the viewer to get absorbed in . \nwe get way off of the topic of the jawbreaker incident , and get into things that don't have anything to do with the actual film . \nthe beginning and ending are strong , it's just the middle that needs a lot of help . \nduring the body of the movie , it is undeniably repetitive , never progressing towards a conclusion . \nnothing to grab the viewer's interest is around , and the same , extremely annoying song plays over and over again . \njawbreaker tries to get off on the same time of humor used in the 1995 film clueless , but falls flat . \nthe few gags that actually work die off quickly and die off with a bang . \nall in all , a horrible disappointment . \nthe bottom line : the tagline reads , \" even the sweetest candies are sour as death inside . \" \nyes , that is too true . \nno matter how good this film may have looked , it fails to deliver . \n", "well there goes another one . \nsadly this like other movies this year wasn't good . \nthis one being almost as bad as 'the omega code' but not quite . \nfrom the opening credits i had a good feeling this would be bad , and well i guess i was right . \nwith bad excuses for acting , a horrible screenplay and straight-out bad direction 'the bachelor' is a terribly unfunny movie that doesn't work on any levels accept that fact that rene zellwegar who does give a good performance . \nthe two cameos by brooke shields and mariah carey are also good with brooke being the best . \nthe movie is troubled from the start because chris o'donnell is hugely miscast and gives one of the worst performances to date . \nhere is the stupid plot : chris o'donnell plays jimmie shelton a man who has just broken up with his girlfriend , he meets anne ( rene zellwegar ) they instantly hit it off and are together for three years . \njimmie decides that he wants to bring their relationship a little bit up . \nhe really doesn't realize that anne thinks he wants to marry her ( what he wants i never did catch ) . \nso he proposes in a really bad way , and she shoots him down and is very mad . \nhe of course tries to apologize but nothing seems to help any . \nthen his grandfather dies and he learns that he has left jimmie 100 million dollars . . . . as \nlong as he marries before the next day at 6 : 05 pm . \nnow jimmie must find anne and try to marry her to get the money and because he loves her , or get married to someone else to get the money itself , leading to an un-funny and predictable ending that leaves a bad taste in our mouths . \nok so maybe this could be one of the dumbest , cliched , silliest romantic comedy to date that has no real big laughs . \neven the supporting roles of artie lange , hal holbrook and ed anser aren't even good . \nthe plot was a good idea , but the script would have to have been written in less than five minutes and by a five year old . \nthe choppy dialogue and bad directing don't help things any . \neven though chris o'donnell gave an ok performance in the two batman movies , he does not give even a remotely good or funny performance here and i wanted to boo and throw my pop at the screen to get rid of him . \nrene zelweggar is a different story and gave a charming , sweet and likable performance ( as usual ) and really was the only thing that saved this confused movie from being a total huge washout . \nher sister played by marley shelton is also good and the two have good chemistry onscreen . \nbrooke shields showed up in a funny little performance as a big-headed mogul who after a while became routine and old . \none really can't help but think that we have seen this stuff before . \nit's not like this is an original idea and in the end , everyone knows what is going to happen due do its cliches and typicalness . \n'the bachelor' works on no good levels and in fact doesn't work at all . \ned anser and hal holbrook were wasted in terrible roles and mariah carey can not act to save her soul , and this could be the only film of her movie career dispite her terrific music career . \nchris o'donnell is not as bad an actor as casper van dien but that is not saying a great deal . \nhe seems held back and really doesn't get into his character much and after even the first 30 minutes gets annoying and old . \nartie lange just to me seems like he is trying to another chris farley and was completely unfunny and un-nerving . \nwhy the filmmakers would want to waste such a cast in such a bad movie , with such bad acting and dialogue is a question only they will know . \nmaybe they thought it would become a hit or a critical success , and sometimes i don't agree with other critics on movies , even from the trailers for this film they made it look bad and showed all the mildly funny parts . \nits based on the 1925 silent film 'seven chances' which i am sure is very better than this mess . \neven though some may think of this as a good date movie , most who see this will want to pull out thier hair and scream for thier money back . \nbesides being a terrible movie , 'the bachelor' is well a terrible movie . \nit has nothing worth recommending therefore i really can't recommend this movie . \ni did not have a good time and i laughed only three times . \nthe running time of the movie is 106 minutes which is wayyyy over time and needs to be shortened at least thirty minutes . \nparts of it seems to go on forever and parts of seem to not last enough time . \nbeing one of the worst movies of the year , we can be sure that i hope they will not make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedies , and if they do they i give up on filmmakers . \n", "my inner flag was at half-mast last year when nick at nite pulled \" dragnet \" reruns off the air . \nsure , i'd seen them all at least once , but i could always count on at least a few inadvertent laughs from ultra-serious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv . \neven though \" dragnet \" is out of circulation at the moment , we webb anti-fans still have the d . i . , a 50's propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous \" blue boy \" episode of \" dragnet . \" \nfor anyone like me who got laughs out of webb's rapid-fire speeches and straight-faced seriousness , think of the d . i . \nas what would happen if sgt . \njoe friday ever enlisted , because he plays exactly the same character here , a no-nonsense old fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation and loves to give long- winded , melodramatic speeches on any topic . \nin this election year , i'm more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth . \nthe movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webb's office door and enters . \nhe gives each one a different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up . \nthe \" produced and directed by jack webb \" card pretty much goes without saying . \nthis is his movie all the way , and after the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no reason , i was wondering if there would even be a plot . \ni certainly would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark webb rants , but the d . i . \ngives us more -- much more . \nwebb's mission is to make a man out of private owens , the local screw-up . \nthe captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or , the captain will \" personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself . \" \n ( whether the \" lace panties \" part refers to webb or owens remains unanswered . ) \nthis , of course , gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owens' life a living hell . \nfor those of you who haven't been indoctrinated into the pleasures of webb watching , here's a reprint of a typical monologue of his . \ni can't duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper , but the words should at least partially convey what i'm talking about . . . \n \" now you listen to me , youngster . \nsomeday you'll wake up fighting on a beach and you'll pray to god somebody doesn't get killed because of your foolishness . . . \ni've got a headline for you : every time you make one of those little mistakes of yours , you're gonna turn around and i'll be standing right there . \" \ni couldn't write down all the reprintable dialogue from the d . i . \n ( nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame ) , but i tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines , like one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard day's work by going to the local bar ( where he orders a tomato juice ) . \nhe meets a woman who , coincidentally , also orders tomato juice but walks away from a typically-stimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his arch-rival , another marine d . i . \nwebb marches over to the table , gets up in her face and says , \" just what kind of a dame do you think you are ? \" \nbogart he ain't . \nthe other d . i . \ngets one of the few memorable non-webb lines when he confesses to the girl , \" he's a damn good d . i . \n . . . \ni guess i'm just a little jealous . \" \njoin the club , we're all jealous of jack webb's way with women , which is showcased even more amusingly in a later scene , as webb finds his way to the woman's place of employment , a lingerie store , and stands around looking incredibly flustered at the negligees on display . \n \" you expect me to talk to you . . . \nin _here_ ? ! \" he exclaims , no doubt intimidated by the barrage of bras . \nthe woman goes off to help a customer , leaving webb to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen . \na little girl spots him in the store and demands , \" what are you doing in here . . . you're a man , aren't you ? \" \nhe doesn't reply , but you know he's thinking in his head , \" what an odd species of human -- so small . \nmust be one of those children everyone's been talking about . \" \nthis poor girl , scarred for life by her early encounter with jack webb , would later swear off the male gender entirely , just one of the many lesbian conversions he's responsible for . \nthe movie doesn't focus too closely on webb's romance , it also continues the owens subplot with probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie , where webb forces his platoon to spend the entire night searching the ground for a flea owens killed during one of their drills . \nafter two privates hatch a scheme to present webb with the wrong dead flea , webb asks owens , \" was that flea you killed a male or female ? \" \nowens replies , \" a male , sir . \" \nwebb yells to the platoon , \" this ain't the one ! \" \nthat such a scene ( along with the rest of the movie ) was intended to be taken seriously defies comment . \nbut we know it was all presented with the utmost seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the marines not only for their cooperation in the making of the d . i . , but for iwo jima , guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of the 20th century . \nwebb held the military in such high esteem that all the soldiers in the movie ( with the exception of owens ) were played by actual marines . \nsomeone wanting to parody this movie couldn't do a more comical job than webb did . \nit makes it all the more ironic ( like raeeyain on your wedding day ) that the man had no sense of humor himself . \nthere's a scene in the movie where the guys are on their break time discussing something and one of them breaks into laughter . \nwebb bursts in the room and shouts , \" what did i tell you about laughing ? ! \" \nto which the private replies , \" sir , only nine-year-old girls laugh , sir ! \" \nand let me tell you , i was as happy as a nine-year- old girl while watching this movie . \n", "frank detorri's ( bill murray ) a single dad who lives on beer and junk food with no apparent understanding of sanitation or hygiene , much to the dismay of his preteen daughter shane ( elena franklin ) . \nwhen he uses the '10 second rule' to retrieve a hard boiled egg from a chimp's cage at the zoo and downs it , he introduces a lethal bacteria into his system . \ninside his skin , the city of frank is in turmoil thanks to the vote-pandering of mayor phlegmming ( voice of william shatner ) , so it's up to one frank pd white blood cell ( voice of chris rock ) to save the day in peter and bobby farrelly's \" osmosis jones . \" \nthe city of frank is a brightly animated ( animation directed by piet kroon and tom sito ) cellular municipality where osmosis jones is a typical rogue cop looking for another chance . \nhe's inadvertently teamed up with drix ( voice of david hyde pierce , tv's \" frasier \" ) , a cold capsule with 12 hours worth of painkillers to dispense . \nthis quarrelling duo are about to go on a \" fantastic voyage \" in order to hunt down thrax ( voice of laurence fishburne ) , the virus intent on shutting down frank . \nwhile the animation is certainly colorful to look at , osmosis jones' story is a hackneyed one . \nthe story cries out for puny puns , but we only get occasional sprinklings of wit or bodily humor ( drix graduated phi beta capsule , he departs on a bus headed for bladder ) . \nneither the hero or villain is particularly interesting ( thrax looks like an animated \" predator \" ) , although hyde pierce is a delightful sidekick . \nadults can desperately keep their eyes peeled for small amusements the animators dot along the landscape . \nmeanwhile , back in live action land , bill murray is reduced to nothing more than a walking gross-out joke . \nthere's no particular enjoyment to be found watching him vomit on molly shannon ( she plays shane's teacher , mrs . boyd ) or hoisting his ingrown toenail onto a restaurant table . \none must wonder how the climatic flatlining of a child's father will play to the family audience as well . \nrest assured , the whole enchilada is wrapped up with a fart joke . \nwhile far less offensive than the farrelly's last effort \" me , myself and irene , \" that film at least spiked some comic highs with jim carrey's hijinx . \n \" osmosis jones \" will probably be ok for the kids , but the farrellys playing for the family audience is like watching marilyn manson croon a phil collins tune . \n", "woof ! too bad that leap of faith was the title of a 1992 comedy starring steve martin and debra winger , because that's what's required to watch this incredulous

\nstory opens with a campy kick--willis is treating a patient who abruptly steps out of the window to take the best flying leap since charles durning dove in the hudsucker proxy . \nshe goes splat ,

every few months we get another presidential conspiracy movie painted as _the_ thriller of the year . \nin 1997 , we've had absolute power , air force one , shadow conspiracy and murder at 1600 . \nthis one is about as lame duck as old gerald ford , trying to bring us a complex plot of cover-up and intrigue but copping out over and over again with rehashes of action flick standbys . \nhere's what happens this time . \nit's night at the white house . \na secretary is having sex with some unidentified guy with a cute butt . \nthe next day she's dead and hotshot detective wesley snipes is called in . \nhow do we know he's a hotshot ? \nwe've seen the traditional action flick opener -- the clever hostage negotiation scene . \nit's not so clever this time , consisting of snipes disarming a suicidal ex-government employee holding a gun to his head in the middle of the street . \nsnipes is off to the white house , where he finds the secret service head ( the shiny bald head of daniel benzali ) won't cooperate with him at all . \nin fact , if not for the intervention of national security adviser alan alda , snipes wouldn't have been allowed in the white house at all . \nalda helps snipes out further , assigning a sexy secret service agent ( diane lane ) to act as his liaison . . . \na very dangerous liaison . \nwell , not really , i just wanted to say that . \nalmost immediately , a suspect is found , an eccentric night janitor seen flirting with the deceased on one of the security videos . \nsnipes doesn't buy it , and launches into an independent investigation of his own , one that reveals planted evidence and romantic involvement by the president's son . \nsnipes' partner , an always- wisecracking dennis miller , calls him up every once in awhile with more news and lane , who at first doesn't believe snipes , eventually and predictably comes around , and risks her ass to break into social security storage and break out some classified information . \nfor the first hour or so , murder at 1600 looks like it could be going somewhere interesting . \nsure , we have to sit through the lame opening sequence and plenty more lame scenes after that , but the whole murder in the white house thing makes for an interesting premise that is never quite delivered upon . \nsnipes and lane don't make for a bad action team , but with nothing to work with , they're just cogs in the bad movie machine . \ndennis miller might as well not even be in the movie ; they waste his talents more in murder at 1600 than they did in bordello of blood , and that's saying a lot . \nwhen you get to the last half-hour , the movie has descended metaphorically and literally into a wet sewer , busting out the old break-into-the-building underground climax . \nand when they finally reveal who killed the woman and why , you'll wish you never sat through this movie at all . \nthe \" 1600 \" in the movie's title doesn't represent an address , it represents the

. \nof course , had the filmmakers attempted to try something new with this material , the well-worn storyline would have been a device to propell the movie forward . \nas it is , though , \" she's all that \" relies * completely * on the lame and overused formula to push it ahead . \nthere's not one original or interesting character in the film , either , and if that wasn't bad enough , there's not one good performance featured . \nthe star of the movie , rachel leigh cook , is simply horrible . \ni usually don't like to get so personal , but in this case , i think it needs to be said . \ncook wears the same expression throughout the flick and looks to be having as miserable a time as i was . \ni was never convinced that she was a \" nerd \" , and her transformation was unconvincing and unnecessary . \nthe movie seems to be saying it's better to be popular than to be who you are . \nas for freddie prinze jr . , an actor i ordinarily enjoy , he too is quite bad here . \nhe coasts through the film on so-called charm , and never establishes a real character . \nkieren culkin is here , too , as the brother of cook . \nand for some indiscernable reason , he's got hearing aids . \nno explanation is given and they're never brought up . \nwere we supposed to feel * sorry * for him just because he wore hearing aids ? \ni don't think so . \nthat single element of the film was one of the most offensive things i've seen in a movie in a long time . \n \" she's all that \" sucks . \nthat's what it boils down to . \nit's not entertaining , and it's not even a good time passer . \nthe hour and a half running time goes by slower than a 5 minute hair-removal system informercial . \nand what's worse , it sends out a bad message to teens . \nit appears to be telling them , \" hey , it doesn't matter if you're happy the way you are . \nthat's unimportant . \nif you want to * truly * be happy , dress in the latest fashions and act like a bubble-headed moron . \" \nugh . \n", "michael robbins' hardball is quite the cinematic achievement . \nin about two hours , we get a glancing examination of ghetto life , a funeral with a heartfelt eulogy , speeches about never giving up , a cache of cute kids ( including a fat one with asthma ) , a hard-luck gambler who finds salvation in a good woman and a climactic \" big game , \" where the underdogs prove to have a bigger bite than anyone ever imagined . \nall that's needed is a guy getting hit in the nuts and a food fight to have the first film solely based on cinematic clich ? s . \ni can't wait to see the deleted scenes when it comes out on dvd . \nobviously , hardball is a strikeout of a movie that never gets the bat anywhere near the ball . \nit stars keanu reeves as the aforementioned gambler , who seems to owe every bookie in chicago an amount of money that rivals the gross national product of guam . \nout of solutions , he begs his successful corporate friend ( the always welcome mike mcglone ) to lend him $5 , 000 . \ninstead , mcglone offers reeves the chance to help him coach a youth baseball team from the projects for a nice weekly stipend . \nreeves , who wants to keep his fingers , accepts the offer , but discovers mcglone is only too happy to let him handle the team entirely . \nthe drowsy-voiced protagonist must teach the sassy inner city kids the baseball basics in a life of absentee parents and merciless gangs . \nand maybe , just maybe , they'll play in the big championship game . \none of the glorious surprises in the screenplay by john gatins ( summer catch ) , adapted from daniel coyle's non-fiction book , is that there aren't any . \nthe movie coasts from heartfelt moment to heartfelt moment like a zombie . \nthat wouldn't be so bad , if the characters had an ounce of subtlety or humanity to them . \nmost of the kids' time is spent yelling at each other , talking in slang and acting surprised . \nthere's little that's naturally amusing about them , as they all seem to know the cameras are rolling . \nthe worst of the lot is a tough-talking younger player ( dewayne warren ) whose sole purpose , as the movie unfolds , is being an emotional pawn , a tactic so utterly despicable i can't find the right words to express myself . \nthe adults also don't fare well . \nreeves is impressively uninspiring as the down-on-his-luck loser . \nthe character is poorly written , but reeves gives another charisma-free performance . \nevery time he speaks , he sounds like he just got up from a long nap and is gradually waking up . \nkids are supposed to rally around this guy ? \ndiane lane , who co-stars as reeves' obligatory love interest , remains a glowing screen presence ( see my dog skip for better proof ) . \nit's too bad that her role here consists of uttering lines like , \" these kids trust you , and they don't trust anyone ! \" \nthen there's d . b . \nsweeney as an evil rival coach and john hawkes as reeves' scummy betting buddy and other unoriginal characters you've seen before and hope never to see again . \ni wanted hardball to be good . \nrobbins' varsity blues was a funny and alternately taut tale of texas high school football that had ali larter smothered in whipped cream and jon voight sneering at everything that moved . \ni haven't seen robbins' goofy ready to rumble in its entirety , but i am intrigued that \" macho man \" randy savage and martin landau can exist in the same movie without there being serious worldwide repercussions . \nrobbins obviously needs to go back to his forte -- making sports movies for guys and not cutesy , cuddly pap such as hardball , which also manages to annoy and insult the audience . \nhere's hoping that happens in the immediate future . \n", "you know something , christmas is not about presents . \nit's about over-hyped holiday films with lots of merchandising and product tie-ins . \nat least that would seem to be the message of \" the grinch , \" which has been advertised since last christmas and whose logo is currently plastered all over stores . \nhollywood expects us to ignore this cynical greed as the movie scolds us about losing the true spirit of the season . \nyou know the plot : there's this evil furry green guy called the grinch ( jim carrey ) who lives on a mountain overlooking whoville . \ndown below all the whos are preparing for their whobilation , but the grinch is determined to steal their christmas . \nthe movie is , of course , a live-action version of the beloved children's book , which was previously adapted into a 1966 tv special by looney tunes animator chuck jones . \nit's rare that a big budget hollywood release is shamed by a thirty-year-old half-hour cartoon , but that's the case when jones' version is compared to ron howard's . \nthe tv grinch hit all the right notes : boris karloff's soft , deep narration ; thurl ravenscroft singing \" mr . grinch \" ; max the dog weighed down by the gigantic antler tied to his head ; and the grinch's wide , toothless grin . \nby contrast , the movie hits one sour note after another . \nfirst , there are the numerous bad choices that jeffrey price and peter seaman made in padding out the short book into a 105-minute movie . \nyoung wide-eyed cindy lou who ( taylor momsen ) is depressed about the misplaced priorities of her parents ( bill irwin and molly shannon ) during the holiday season . \nshe begins to sympathize with the grinch , who turns out to be surprisingly sympathetic . \ncindy lou discovers that the grinch turned tearfully away from whoville in grammar school when he was publicly humiliated while expressing his love for the prettiest girl in the class , martha may whovier ( played as an adult by christine baranski ) . \nare we expected to like the grinch , hate the whos , and want him to steal christmas ? \nthe grinch isn't even the villain here ; that role is filled by the corrupt mayor of whoville ( jeffrey tambor ) who was the grinch's rival for martha's affection . \nnot only are the characters needlessly complex , but the once-simple plot becomes so convoluted that the actual theft of christmas seems like an afterthought . \nthe casting choices aren't any better than the screenwriting decisions . \njim carrey seems woefully miscast . \nwhile his face is so supple that the rubber make-up seems superfluous , carrey brings nothing else to the role . \nhis accent keeps changing ; i assume he was shooting for karloff , but he ends up sounding like a weird slurry of richard nixon , sean connery , and cartman from \" south park . \" \nnot knowing what else to do during his many scenes alone in the grinch's home , carrey falls back on his stand-up comedy and clowns around ace ventura-style . \nneedless to say , his wise-cracking antics don't quite fit the character of the grinch , who is an embittered loner filled with hate . \nlittle taylor momsen brings little to role of cindy lou except big eyes and a cute smile . \nshe would have been fine if cindy lou was limited to her original purpose in the seuss story ( finding \" santa \" in her living room stealing the tree ) . \nhowever , the expanded script makes cindy as important as the grinch , and momsen is not up to the challenge . \nbottom line : when you're stealing christmas ( movies ) , leave this one behind . \n", "in the mid-1980s , following the splendid debut in hugh hudson's greystoke and relative success of first highlander film , it looked like christopher lambert's acting career might go somewhere . \nbut , it wasn't meant to be , which became obvious following highlander ii . \nin this decade christopher lambert became associated with films with low budgets and even lower quality . \nvery often such films were science fiction , which meant that the fans of that genre learned the hard way what to evade anything starring christopher lambert . \nwhether it was because of real lack of talent , terrible miscasting or simple bad luck isn't important - the end result was almost always horrible . \nthe same can be said for fortress , 1993 science fiction film directed by stuart gordon , director who created cult following with his 1980s horror gorefests like reanimator and from beyond . \nthe movie is set in 2018 . \nfor some undisclosed reason , usa introduced strict population control and couples are barred from having more than one child . \njake ( christopher lambert ) and karen brennick ( lori laughlin ) broke that law and are caught by authorities on the border . \nsentenced to 31 years in prison , they are both thrown into fortress , privately owned correctional facility , equiped with state-of-the-art futuristic technology and run by computer called zed . \nalthough equiped with gismos that regulate every aspect of inmates' lives and make any escape impossible , prison authorities often use violence . \njake survives many ordeals and earns respect of some inmates which would help him when he begins planing the escape . \nsuch escape should become necessity , because the warden poe ( kurtwood smith ) begins showing unhealthy interest in karen . \nafter rather intriguing beginning and some interesting special effects that depict the futuristic settings of prison , this film soon starts sinking into mediocrity . \nthe reason is in the screenplay that quickly degenerates into whole series of prison movie clich ? s and situations that are painfully predictable . \nby the time brennick begins his escape from fortress , those situations not only begin to look predictable , but utterly implausible too . \nof course , film never tried to explain why the country that lacks resources to support its present population happens to spend bucketloads of money on ultra-expensive supertechnology with sole intention of keeping alive most useless and dangerous members of the society . \nthe initially interesting plot is done even more wrong by stereotyped characters , played by not too interested or talented actors . \nlori laughlin , although physically attractive , shows the acting ability of sequoia . \nkurtwood smith as prison warden is rather uninspired , capable of solid , yet forgettable performance . \nlambert's performance is also good , but even the bigger talent couldn't help this film , destined to end in oblivion . \n", "susan granger's review of \" the musketeer \" ( universal pictures ) \nhollywood launches another assault on classic literature with this $50 million adaptation of alexandre dumas's novel that's strong on action but weak on drama , fusing hong kong martial arts with 17th century swordplay . \nthe story chronicles the adventures of the dashing d'artagnan ( justin chambers ) as he leaves his village of gascogne , headed for paris , to join king louis xiii's elite guard , the royal musketeers , and to search for the man who killed his parents 14 years earlier . \nthis puts him in conflict with the formidable febre ( tim roth ) , vicious henchman for conniving cardinal richelieu ( stephen rea ) . \nthe traditional musketeer trio - aramis ( nick moran ) , athos ( jan gregor kremp ) and porthos ( steve speirs ) - don't offer much help so he turns to the feisty francesca ( mena suvari ) , chambermaid to the queen of france ( catherine deneuve ) . \nscripter gene quintano and director-cinematographer peter hyams are primarily interested in the derring-do , as evidenced by choreographer xin-xin xiong's elaborate - but not original - stunts , including a fast-paced stagecoach chase , a tavern brawl on rolling barrels , high-wire acrobatics with the combatants dangling from ropes , and a ladder-fight sequence . \nfilmed in southern france , the scenery , sets and costumes are spectacular , but the lighting is too dark and editing is filled with choppy , restless mtv'ish cuts . \nas the swashbuckling d'artagnan , bland calvin klein model justin chambers buckles where he should be swashing , totally lacking on-screen charisma , not to mention acting skill . \nmena suvari , so impressive in \" american beauty , \" seems like a contemporary interloper in the royal court . \non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" the musketeer \" is a cinematic but shallow 3 . \n \" all for one and one for all \" ? \nnot this time 'round . \n", "note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \nat the end of the day , those reflecting upon the debacle that is the avengers would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros . made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped plans for a gala premiere . \nthis highly-anticipated film rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june opening , where it would have gone head-to-head against the rival studios' heavy hitters ; its eventual demotion to a less potent mid-august opening was an obvious early indication of the studio's lack of confidence with the picture . \nand with good reason . \nthis is a joyless exercise of a film , held together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement , thrills or wit . \nremarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving , the avengers is a catastrophic mess which immediately invites comparisons to last year's case study in style over substance , joel schumacher's much-loathed batman & robin . \n ( indeed , both films even feature appalling , ridiculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes . ) \numa thurman , who takes on the salacious role of the catsuit-clad , karate-chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg , was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster , imbuing her poison ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage . \nunfortunately , the same can't be said here , where she and cohort ralph fiennes ( our new john steed , taking over for patrick macnee ) demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever , fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double-entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that they're on board a sinking ship . \nat this rate , usually-splendid actor mr . fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man -- his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably-neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days . \nthe duo * look * the part -- and admittedly the avengers is , more than most , heavily dependent upon style -- but they're no fun to watch , and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the picture's caper-esque plot . \nwhen not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat , i began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma as our mrs . peel -- no , not kate beckinsale ( although the notion now intrigues me ) , but gwyneth paltrow , who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle a spot-on english accent . \nif nothing else , it'd at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt . \nthe story , such as it is , involves the ever-bemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) , an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climate-controlling contraption . \n ( they also sip a lot of tea . ) \noverlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists' superiors , it sounds far better than it plays , and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant post-production tinkering ; it's clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds . \nthe avengers was never about gripping drama , and our heroes accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously , but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac , it's all decidedly uncompelling . \nmr . connery , who's onscreen barely long enough to register an impression , approaches the role like a man fulfilling a contractual obligation , simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest . \nat least it all looks good . \nthis is a genuinely handsome production , with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt . \nin particular , the gleaming production design by stuart craig commands attention , adeptly drawing elements both old and new in order to depict this great britain . \nthere are a handful of striking visual moments in the film , including an attack by a swarm of giant robotic bees and a nice shot of steed and peel finding a way to walk on water , but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates . \nby the time the film's climax had arrived , my interest was not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing waves and thundering rain , but with the quickest escape route from the theatre . \nnot coincidentally , the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into the movie's remarkable trailer , a savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself ; the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year . \nit's everything that the avengers is not -- saucy , clever , engaging , and entertaining . \na crushing disappointment , the film is one of the worst outings of the year -- too drearily awful to be savoured as gleefully bad , too polished to overlook its deficiencies . \nthere may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than the avengers , but i sure hope not . \n", "stallone attempts to 'act' in this cop drama . \nthe film is set in a neighbourhood pratically built by kietal , who's nephew ( played by michael rappaport ) is involved in a car crash and killing of two black youths . \nkeital dosen't really want to get involved in anything , gets rid of rappaport , and stallone and de niro try to work out what the hell is going on . \nthis film should be brilliant . \nit sounds like a great plot , the actors are first grade , and the supporting cast is good aswell , and stallone is attempting to deliver a good performance . \nhowever , it can't hold up . \nalthough the acting is fantastic ( even stallone isn't bad ) the directing and story is dull and long winded \nsome scenes go on for too long , with nothing really happening in them . \nin fact , the only scenes that do work are action scenes , which i suspect stallone was trying to avoid . \nin this film , serious means dull . \nthe dialogue is warbling , and basically just repeats the same points over and over , no matter who is delivering them . \nthe plot , which has potential , is wasted , again just being cliched after a while . \nin fact , the only thing that does keep the film going is kietal and de niro , both delivering their usual good performances . \nhowever , stallone , although not given much to say , gives a good performance . \nhowever , it's not all that bad . \nas said above , the action scenes are well done . \ntheres also a very good ending , which uses the cinemas sound system well . \nin fact , the last 10 minutes of this 2 hour film are one of the best endings of 1997 . \nif only the rest of the film was as good as the ending . \ncop land , then , turns out not to be a power house film , but a rather dull , and not every exciting film . \nhugely disappointing , and i can't really recommend it . \n", "the first species was a moderately-successful science fiction yarn that diverted audiences with some nifty special effects , a few well- paced action sequences , and frequent views of model-turned-actress natasha henstridge sans clothing . \nhowever , it was definitely not a movie that cried out for a sequel . \nand , considering the quality of species 2 , it's obvious that mgm should have stopped while they were ahead . \nthe only thing that distinguishes species 2 is how awful it is . \nif you throw away the plot , which is characterized by a blatant disregard for intelligence , logic , coherence , and consistency , species 2 actually has a few things to recommend it to a select audience . \nof course , that audience is primarily comprised of teenage boys ( who , at least in theory , shouldn't be able to get into an \" r \" -rated film ) and connoisseurs of bad movies . \nthere's enough blood , gore , simulated sex , and bare flesh in species 2 to prevent it from ever becoming boring . \nthis is a grade z exploitation flick that's ripe for the mystery science theater 3000 treatment . \nsomewhere , someplace , i recall hearing species 2 described as \" erotic . \" \ni would love to know who used with that adjective for this movie , because he ( or she ) has a peculiar notion of eroticism . \nsure , there's a lot of sex and nudity , but it's almost always accompanied by the ripping open of a woman's abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free , splattering blood and gore in all directions . \nanyone turned on by that is not someone i would care to be sitting next to in a theater . \ni suppose the main attraction in species 2 is natasha henstridge ( and , to get the obvious question out of the way -- yes , she does remove her top , but only once , and only briefly ) . \nalthough the character she played in the original species is dead , government scientists still have the dna , and , out of what can only be described as a suicidal impulse , they decide to create another clone . \nthis creature , dubbed \" eve \" by its creator , dr . laura baker ( played by marg helgenberger , reprising her role ) , is genetically engineered to be kinder and more docile . \nmeanwhile , man has finally set foot on mars . \na team of three , led by patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , has traveled to the red planet , but when they return to earth , they bring something with them . \nross has become a half-human/half-alien hybrid , and he's soon mating like crazy , collecting the blood-soaked children that are the result of each sex session . \nhis intention is obviously world domination . \nstanding in his way is that indomitable soldier of fortune from the first film , preston lennox ( michael madsen ) , and one of patrick's fellow astronauts , dennis gamble ( mykelti williamson ) . \nbut when patrick learns about eve , a female of his kind , there's no damping his ardor . \ni'm not sure what the budget for species 2 was , but a significant portion of it must have gone into paying handsome salaries to several recognizable actors ( as opposed to being diverted into the special effects ) . \nmichael madsen and marg helgenberger , both back for a second round , are clearly on hand to do as little as they can , grab the money , and run . \nditto for james cromwell , who plays patrick's father -- \" underused \" is too kind a word to describe his involvement ( \" invisible \" would be more like it ) . \ngeorge dzundza gets to do a little scenery- chewing as an angry-but-inept general . \nmeanwhile , justin lazard's performance as patrick is so flat that he makes natasha henstridge's limited abilities look good by comparison . \nthe only one in the whole production with any energy is mykelti williamson , who is cast in the part of the wisecracking black sidekick . \ncomplete with cheesy special effects , bare breasts around every narrative corner , and dialogue capable of producing howls of laughter , species 2 has been dumped into the marketplace without advance screenings for critics . \ndirector peter medak , a journeyman film maker with a significant list of mediocre movies on his resume , has added another forgettable title , but at least he appears to have had fun doing it , which is more than can be said of anyone trying to take this film with even a scintilla of seriousness . \ndo i recommend the movie ? \nabsolutely not , but i will admit that species 2 is dopey enough that it didn't try my patience to the degree that some pseudo-intellectual bad movies do . \nhere's hoping there's no species 3 . \n", "a number of critics have decided that it's open season on freddie prize jr . , slamming the young actor as an utterly talentless pretty boy on career cruise control in sound-alike , disposable teen fluff like \" head over heels , \" \" boys and girls , \" \" down to you \" and \" she's all that . \" \nwhile the prinze oeuvre is hard to defend , his talent is not . \ni first saw him in the independent dark comedy \" the house of yes , \" where he gave a subtle , impressive performance as the younger brother in one of america's freakiest families . \nprinze has the acting chops ; he just needs to take a few supporting roles in some grown-up movies to show the non-believers that he has what it takes . \n \" summer catch \" certainly won't help his case . \ninoffensive , but utterly generic , the baseball-related romantic comedy does little more than kill time . \nthe story deals with the love affair between tenley ( jessica biel ) , a wealthy cape cod girl and ryan ( prinze ) , a local boy from a working class family who dreams of becoming a big-time baseball star . \nryan's preoccupation with his new honey-bunny drives her elitist father ( bruce davison ) crazy and endangers his position as pitcher with a cape cod summer league team . \nit's a wonder the kid has any time to pitch , as his time is occupied with making out with tenley , fighting with her dad , bonding with his own dad ( fred ward , who deserves better than this ) , fighting with his brother ( jason gedrick ) and carousing at a neighborhood bar with his teammates . \nthe filmmakers desperately want to make a quirky , character-heavy baseball movie like \" bull durham , \" but haven't got a clue how to get there . \nand so they glide from one clich ? to the next for 108 minutes . \nthe only bit of originality comes from marc blucas in a minor role as a center-fielder from texas . \nin an early barroom scene , blucas , best known as demon-fighting riley finn from \" buffy the vampire slayer , \" hears a young woman compliment a guy on his ass , then turns to teammate matthew lillard and states , \" he does have a nice ass . \na bubble butt . \" \nwhen lillard gives him an \" are you insane ? \" \nlook , blucas calmly says , \" it's nothing sexual , \" then goes on to evaluate the hind-ends of some other players , including lillard's . \nspeaking of asses , prinze does not bare his in the movie . \nthe actor has a no nudity clause in his contract , so two stunt-butts were employed for a couple of semi-nude shots . \nblucas , whose character secretly dates a large woman throughout the story , gets another unique moment late in the film . \nsick of hearing teammates make \" fat chick \" jokes , he climbs on top of a table and loudly declares his love of amply-sized ladies . \nwhile his speech still ends up objectifying women , it remains a nice change of pace in a numbingly ordinary movie . \ntrivial tidbit : \" summer catch \" marks a scooby doo summit . \nmarc blucas appears in \" jay and silent bob strike back \" as fred from the scooby doo gang , while freddie prinze jr . plays the same character in the upcoming big budget film version of the old cartoon . \n", "everybody in this film's thinking of alicia . \nno , this is not a documentary on those of us after we first saw the \" cryin' \" video . \nthis is one

when the first previews were released last thanksgiving , i was ready to see the film . \nbut then there was the hype , the insane marketing campaign , and lucasfilm's secretive snobbery over the picture . \nin the last weeks before the picture opened , while multitudes of fans waited outside of theaters and stood in the boiling sun days in advance just to be the first ones in the theater , i was tired of hearing about it . \ni was tired of seeing cardboard cut-outs of the characters whenever i went to kfc or taco bell . \ni just wanted to see the movie . \nreader , do not misunderstand . \ni did not have an anti-hype reaction . \nthe hype was unavoidable . \ni understand and accept the hype -- it's just what happens when the prequel to the most widely beloved films of all time get released . \nfive minutes into the phantom menace , i knew there was a problem . \n \" who are these jedi knights ? \" \ni asked . \n \" why are they churning out stale dialogue with machine-gun rapidity ? \" \n \" why aren't these characters being developed before their adventures ? \" \n \" why is there a special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film ? \" \nthese were just some of my questions early on . \nlater , i asked , \" where's the magic of the first three films ? \" \nand \" why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minutes ? ' \nby the end of the film , i was tired , maddened , and depressed . \ngeorge lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless , mindless , summer blockbuster . \nthe phantom menace is no star wars film . \ntake away the title and the jedi talk and the force , and you're left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time . \nit's an embarrassment . \ni looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored , or a new theme is examined , or a special effects shot isn't used . \nthere are a few of each , but they're all token attempts . \nthe fact is , george lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie and a pretty good showcase for digital effects . \nthis is not what i wanted to see . \ni didn't want to leave the phantom menace with a headache and a bitter taste in my mouth , but i did . \nthe story centers mostly around qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson , looking lost and confused ) and his apprentice , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor , who scarcely has a line in the film ) and their attempts to liberate the people of the planet naboo . \nnaboo is the victim of a bureaucratic war with the trade federation ; their contact on naboo is queen amidala ( natalie portman ) , the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people . \nafter picking up jar jar binks ( a completely cgi character , voiced by ahmed best ) , they head to tatooine , where they meet young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his mother ( pernilla august ) . \nqui-gon knows that the force is strong with young anakin , and so the jedi knights take the boy with them on their journeys . \nthe bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious , neither of whom have enough lines to register as characters . \nthere isn't anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form . \nthe way lucas has handled it , however , it unsatisfactory . \nfirst of all , we don't learn one single thing about qui-gon jinn . \nnot one thing . \nwhat was his life like before this film ? \nwell , i imagine he didn't have one . \nthat's why he feels like a plot device . \nthis probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role , and why he's recently retired from film ( i don't blame him , honestly ) . \nobi-wan , a character i was really looking forward to learning more about , is even less interesting . \nmcgregor has just a few lines , so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere . \nsince these two men are the focus of the phantom menace , lucas has served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie . \nthings start to pick up when our characters reach tatooine ; young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshed-out character in the film , and lloyd does a thoughtful job with the role . \ni was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene ; rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting . \nand when anakin says goodbye to his mother , i found it moving . \nalso fairly good is portman , and she manages to give a little depth to a character where no depth has been written . \njar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters i've ever had to endure , but he's more interesting than most of the humans . \nas soon as the relatively-brief segment on tatooine is over , it's back to the mind-numbing special effects and depthless action scenes . \ni've seen many movies that qualify as \" special effects extravaganzas , \" but the phantom menace is the first one i've seen that had me sick of the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie . \nthe reason is obvious : george lucas has no restraint . \ni can't say that i didn't find the effects original , because i did -- the final battle between darth maul , obi-wan , and qui-gon is visually exceptional , as is most of the film . \nbut i also found the effects deadening and tiresome . \nmy breaking point was near the end of the picture , as anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi masters ; in the background , we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through a digital sky , and i wanted that to go away . \ncan't we have one stinking scene that isn't bursting at the seems with a special effects shot ? \ni got so sick of looking at the cgi characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that i really just wanted to go outside and look at a physical landscape for a few hours . \nand then there's the question of magic . \nwhat was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return of the jedi ? \ni have a feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel . \njohn williams' familiar score is no help , nor is lucas' direction . \ni think it comes right down to characters : there are none here . \ni longed for the magnetic presence of han , luke , and leia , but i got no such thing . \nand what about the ridiculous expectations ? \nmine weren't that high ; i simply wanted a film that showed me the roots of the films that i grew up loving , a story that had a few characters and a few great special effects . \ninstead , i got two hours and fifteen minutes of a lifeless and imaginative computer graphics show . \ni don't hate the phantom menace as much as i resent it : i'd like to forget that it exists , and yet i can't . \nit's here to stay . \ni can only hope that episodes ii and iii have something of substance in them , because if they don't , then lucas will have pulled off the impossible task of destroying his own indestructible series . \n", "the lives of older people in the twilight of their years attempting to come to grips with their shared histories and possible futures is a fascinating topic . \nfinding an all-star cast for such a film is a stroke of genius . \ncombining all that with a three-time oscar-winning director ( robert benton of \" kramer vs . \nkramer \" ) and creating a decidedly mediocre movie is the stuff of disappointment . \nin yet another noir mystery set in hollywood -- how many of these have we seen during the past few years ? \n-- the atmosphere is moody , the actors enjoyable to watch and the story goes nowhere . \nover-70 harry ross ( paul newman ) is a washed up cop-turned-private eye-turned man friday trying to figure out how to live what remains of his life . \nhe's screwed up things pretty well ( \" i had a wife and daughter . \nnow , i'm a drunk ) and is at a crossroads . \na couple of years ago , he traveled to mexico to bring back mel ( reese witherspoon ) , the under-age daughter of jack ( gene hackman ) and catherine ( susan sarandon ) ames and now lives with them . \nthe ames are former movie stars , past their prime and the three have become fast friends . \none gets the impression that ross is just hanging out waiting for something to wake him up . \nto fill his time , he does odd jobs for jack and falls in love with catherine . \njack is in even worse shape than harry . \nhe's dying of cancer with only a year to live . \nthings do turn more exciting when jack asks harry to drop off a sealed manila envelope for him . \ninstead of the routine errand that ross expects , he walks into a barrage of bullets from the gun of another ex-cop who is , himself , full of bloody holes . \nthis unsettling event gives the former detective a project to throw himself into and launches an investigation that revolves around the mysterious disappearance of catherine's first husband 20 years before . \nthrough a series of very complex and convoluted plot devices that involve murder ; blackmail ; guns ; mel's mexico traveling partner and his parole officer ; ross's former cop buddies , ex-lover and would-be sidekick , the tale finally ends up exactly where everyone expects it to . \nit's a film noir tradition that the story twists and turns down side roads for an unexpected finale , but here the journey meanders towards an ending that no one cares about . \nthe only surprises are exactly whose face fits which role in the scenario . \nby the time they show you , it doesn't matter . \nthe storyline gets goofier and goofier exemplified in ross's relationship with rubin ( giancarlo esposito ) , a partner wannabe . \nthese scenes are obviously designed to be comic relief , however they are neither . \nrubin and ross have some past relationship but either it's not explained or i didn't care enough at that point to remember . \na running joke about where harry was supposedly shot while in mexico is probably meant to mirror his questions about whether he is still able to perform . \nit's also not funny , doesn't connect and keeps on showing up long after it has run its course . \non the positive side , it's often enjoyable to watch the seasoned actors on the screen . \nthe three leads all have well-deserved academy awards and turn in accomplished , if not extraordinary jobs . \nnewman is a grand actor , but doesn't seem quite suited to the dark film style . \nhe is a bit too clean and understated to come across as desperate and down and out . \nhackman , also low-key , is believable but lacks sparkle . \nsarandon comes across well as an sultry older babe although she is one-dimensional . \nthe actors do what they can with lame dialog , but they can't pull the film out of the hole it's dug for itself . \njames garner who plays ross's old buddy ex-cop raymond hope is always a treat , but even he half-heartedly struggles through lines like \" i'm glad they didn't shoot your pecker off . \" \nthe best part of the film is the look at old friends , how their relationships change over the years and the difficult choices they must make . \nthe genuinely easy and casual interactions among the actors hint that being on the set was much more interesting than what ended up on the screen \nthe film doesn't run very long before the audience realizes that it's hopeless . \nthe only reason for watching is the actors . \nit reminds me of disaster movies such as \" towering inferno \" where the star power is supposed to make everyone ignore the film's problems . \nin a better world , there would have been second-rate actors in this second-rate movie and the ones here would have been saved for something better . \nof course , we don't live in that better world , but you could make yours a little nicer by choosing a different movie . \n", "martial arts master steven seagal ( not to mention director ! ) has built a career out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial arts superman who never gets hurt in fights , talks in a hushed tone , and squints at any sign of danger . \nhe's also the most consistent individual in hollywood today , since all his movies suck . \nthey basically represent his egotisitical tendencies about his art ( that is , martial art ) . \ni'm sure the guy's good , and he seems like a nice guy on talk shows , although a tad haughty , but these movies he makes are all the same : a guy who is basically indestructable , is maybe wounded supposedly mortally , then comes back with a vengeance and goes buddha on all the baddies asses ( although i kinda liked \" under siege \" ) . \nof course , this one , as a change , has a \" message \" that is drilled into our mind . . . of \ncourse , after he blows up a lot of stuff and kills a bunch of people . \nso why do i watch his crap ? \ni usually don't . \ni will never , and you can hold me to this , i will never pay to see this man's movies , unless , and only unless , he's in a supporting role ( i . e . \n \" executive decision \" ) and i'd definitely pay if he dies ( i . e . \n \" executive decision \" ) . \nbut this one has a special place in my heart . \nthis doesn't mean it's good or that i even liked it . \nthis was the last movie i watched with my deceased uncle , and we had one hell of a time ripping it apart a la \" mystery science theatre 3000 , \" and this was a couple years before i had heard of \" mystery science theatre 3000 . \" \nin this one , seagal plays a worker for a mining factory set in alaska and run by the greased-up typical shallow villain , this time played by an oscar-winner to give the movie some more clout - michael caine . \nit seems that caine wants to do something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land . \naround the 20-30 minute point , seagal speaks up to him in what seems to be the typical speech to all the vain entrepeneurs ( what with his new \" fire down below , \" another \" message film \" ) , and caine has him bumped off . . . or \ndoes he ? \nseagal is rescued by some inuits , and falls in love with one of them , played by joan chen , who can act , hypothetically , but , for some reason , not here . \none of caine's cliched henchmen ( played here with a lot of overacting by john c . mcginley ) shoots the cheif of the inuit clan , and chen and seagal go on a voyage to take down the oil factory . . . literally , \nof course . \nat one point , seagal gives a wonderfully hysterical speech about how he doesn't have any options but blow stuff up . \nhe even goes as far as to say , \" i don't want to kill someone , \" and in the same breath , he asks some guy where the arsenal is . \ni have no problem with violence . \ni'm a huge john woo fan , but he paints his films with suspense , skill , style , depth , characterization , and just plain cool violence . \nin the films of seagal , the suspense mainly consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly , and him either wounding or killing them . \nat some points , they use the cliche of the talking villain , where the villain has the advantage , can shoot seagal , but begins talking by either telling him his big secret plan , or saying a corny line , to which seagal says something hokey back , and has had enough time to devise of a way to do away with them , and does . \nthis would be okay if there were any suspense or if it didn't take itself seriously at all , like in the case of this summer's \" con air . \" \nbut seagal is serious about his skill , and of course , his message . \ni wouldn't mind if this was a message film in the way that they present it to you with evidence . \nbut seagal has no idea how to present a film where the message is subtle , not pounded into the viewer's mind . \nthe villain is totally shallow and cartoonish , thus we can't take him and his motives seriously , and while seagal talks about being kind to the environment , he also goes ahead and blows up a square mile of rig , and kills some workers who were just doing his job . \nthen at the end , he spends a good 10 minutes giving a speech , just in case you didn't get the message from the trailers . \nwhat seagal doesn't realize is that no one takes his films seriously ( although maybe a couple do ) and any message he has is no only redundant , but doesn't comfortably fit in his film , which is filled to the brim with hokey violence , crap suspense , stupid melodrama , and characters who have about as much emotional depth as a petri dish . \nas far as seagal and his acting , he's rather boring . \nhe squints , he kills . \nperiod . \nnothing else . \noh , yeah , there's corny one-liners ( \" i'm gonna reach out and touch someone ! \" ) . \nof course , he's the star , and we're supposed to root for him and all , so he makes all the villains unbelievably stupid and a bunch of jerks . \nmichael caine , who's a great actor , is just supposed to yell and look cold . \nhe does it well , i guess , but this is no \" alfie . \" \nof coure , no one was expecting that caliber of performance from him . \nhis big henchman , john c . mcginley is kinda boring as well , but is not horrible . \nand we even get a small performance from that god of drill sergeants on celluloid , r . lee ermey ( from \" full metal jacket \" ) as a hired assasin squad leader who gets to say the obligatory speech about how dangerous seagal is , just for the movie trailers and for seagal's ego . \nand also , look for billy bob thornton as one of ermey's assasins . \nanyway , to conclude this all , to judge one of seagal's movies is to judge all of them ( except for \" under siege \" and \" executive decision , \" though the latter is not really a \" seagal movie \" ) . \nthey all have this same formula , they all have the same action , same villain , same plot , but this one has that message , which makes it more excrucitating to watch . \ni mean , if you do rent it , and i don't reccomend you do , make sure you just skip the last 10 minutes . \nbut i have to put it to seagal for creating a film so bad , that the last film i viewed with my uncle was a pleasurable one . \nmy ( extra star for the fun it is to watch and mock ) \n", "arye cross and courteney cox star as a pair of bostonians who meet in a bar , go to the movies , fall in love , move in together , etc . \nreview ====== \nwell , if you haven't seen when harry met sally or he said , she said , or if you don't watch love & war on television , you might think this is the most inventive film to come along in ages . \nhowever , if you've seen any of these , than you have seen most of this film . \nthis of course doesn't mean its bad . \nsome of it is amusing , but overall , i just had to ask what's the point ? \narye cross is the stereotypical single male who falls in love . \nkevin pollack is the stereotypical female-fearing best friend who make a lot of rather sexist and vulgar jokes , most if which weren't very funny . \ncouteney cox is the stereotypical career-minded woman who falls in love . \njulie brown is the stereotypical bizarre best friend of said woman . \n ( notice the frequent use of the word stereotypical . \nthis film uses a lot of formula , the plot is basically known from the opening credits . ) \nso what is good about the movie ? \nwell as i said there are a few amusing moments . \nsurprisingly , julie brown , who i usually find just plain goofy , was the best thing in the film . \nalso there are several very funny sequences involving analysis of the human mating ritual . \ngee , this is really short . \nnot much to say about the film really . \nit is just kind of there . \nwatching it on video might not be a complete waste of time , but i wouldn't recommend hiring a baby sitter or spending a lot of money to see it at the theatre . \n", "_soldier_ is hands down one of the worst movies a person could ever have to sit through that doesn't have jean claude van damme in it . \ni could liken it to the sci-fi cheese that was the hollywood product-of-choice back in the early 80s , but that would be too much of a compliment . \nif there is a movie theater in hell , this film is playing there 24 hours a day . \nthe story , such that there is , revolves around todd ( kurt russell ) , an automaton of a man who has been raised from birth to be a merciless soldier in a not-too-distant ultra-conservative future ( is there any other kind ? ) \nafter years of desensitization at a military academy full of other boys just like him , todd becomes a ground fighter in a series of wars all over the galaxy . \nwho the enemies in these wars are is never revealed , but the few glimpses of todd in battle show that it doesn't matter , because innocent hostages are wiped out as indifferently as the bad guys . \nafter ten minutes of this nihilistic trash -- yes folks , there's more -- we see todd as a buff , scarred adult , now so accustomed to the carnage that no confrontation at all causes him to break a sweat . \nthere's a new wrinkle , though . \ntodd and his brethren are declared obsolete , and a new batch of soldiers takes their place . \nafter losing a sanctioned battle with _dragon_'s jason scott lee , the seemingly dead todd is dumped by a flying ice-cube tray ( well , that's what is looked like ) on a remote garbage planet . \nif you predict that todd meets a bunch of outcast settlers on this planet , and that they band together to fight a bunch of bad guys coming to destroy them , you're way ahead of the game . \nthe renegade society on this trash heap is so clich you half-expect tina turner and master blaster to come strolling into frame any minute . \nit's surprising that _soldier_ is the brain-child of _blade runner_ co-writer david webb peoples . \nunlike that mind-twisting classic , this film contains just barely enough dialogue to fill about three double-spaced pages . \nadd into the mix the _mortal kombat_'s paul anderson inept direction , and it's easy to see how _soldier_ turned out so bad . \nand the special effects ! \nremember the flying steam irons in hardware wars ? \ngary busey is in this movie . \n'nuff said . \n_soldier_ is proof that hollywood still has plenty of bad ideas sitting in its script vaults . \nthat this sad film made it to the silver screen should encourage plenty of aspiring screenwriters out there that there is hope after all . \nnow if you'll excuse me , i have to go weep for the future . \n", "it's a sad state of affairs when the back box blurb is more exciting than the movie contained within it . \nsuch is the case for the 1990 paul mayersberg film _the last samurai_ . \nthough the blurb alludes to \" a jungle filled with political intrigue , uneasy alliances , and murderous enemies at every turn , \" the story of the movie is actually quite simple ( and prosaic ) : a middle-aged japanese businessman named endo ( played by john fujioka ) and his assistant , both of whom have samurai aspirations , travel to africa in search of his ancestor , who went to bring buddhism to africa . \nhe hires the services of down-at-the-heels vietnam veteran pilot johnny congo ( the redoubtable lance henriksen ) and his girlfriend ( arabella holzbog ) , and travels to the camp of an arms-merchant-cum-safari-host- cum-islamic-missionary ( john saxon ) and his wife ( lisa eilbacher ) . \nthey are all kidnapped by an african revolutionary guerilla with witch-doctor aspirations to conceal a pre-arranged arms deal , which subsequently falls through . \ncongo escapes , finds endo's ancestor's sword , and comes back , guns blazing , to free the rest of them , and endo kills the revolutionary with the sword . \nthe end . \n_the last samurai_ is one of those movies that is neither bad enough nor good enough to be enjoyable . \nit is merely _there_ . \nthe murky plot is filled with subtexts that are never elaborated , subplots that are never explained , and many scenes that make very little sense at all . \nthe film is shot through with all the tired old \" inscrutable japanese samurai \" and zen stereotypes that are to be expected from an american movie . \nit is quite slow-paced , with only a bit of action near the end , and the final duel between endo and the terrorist is quite anticlimactic . \nmost of the acting is fair , with the possible exception of congo's girlfriend . \nlance henriksen is his usual scene-chewing self , and is one of few possible reasons anyone might conceivably have for seeing this movie . \nthe only other bright spot is the sweeping african scenery . \ni paid $3 for this film , from the discount rack at best buy , and halfway suspect i overpaid for it . \nif you are in the mood for samurai , read a clavell novel or watch a kurusawa movie . \nskip _the last samurai_ unless you are a die-hard henriksen fan . \n", "birthdays often cause individuals to access their lives . \nare we doing what we want to be doing ? \nwhat happened to our dreams ? \nwith the new millennium , our collective big birthday , just around the corner , some people are sensing a certain dissatisfaction with their existence . \nthe old standbys of traditional religion and science aren't doing it for many anymore and they're looking for something else . \nwe'll be seeing more and more films with a metaphysical theme over the next few years . \nricky hayman ( jeff goldblum ) is having a career crisis . \nthe programming director for the good buy home shopping network , he's going to be fired unless sales increase dramatically . \nnew producer kate newell ( kelly preston ) is supposed to whip things into shape . \nwhen the two are fixing a flat , they almost run down new age pilgrim \" g \" ( murphy ) . \ng wanders onto the television set and connects with the viewers by telling them that they don't really want all that commercial crap . \nin some unexplained manner , this causes sales to sour . \nricky is saved . \nthe movie tries to be too much at once and fails at it all . \nit's not an over-the-top comedy or a heart-warming message of humanity . \nit _is_ a mish-mosh of poorly directed scenes made even worse by insipid dialog . \ni am willing to put up with preaching from a film , but the messages here are old hat . \nyou should take time to smell the roses . \nselling your soul for cash is a bad idea . \ngolly . \ni'm glad i saw the movie . \ni never would have thought of these . \nthe opportunity to poke fun at the goofy products is mostly missed . \nwhen g takes a chainsaw to the set , there's an obvious chance for murphy to be hilarious . \nit doesn't happen . \nthe bits are so subdued and overly-long that there's only a hint of laughter from the audience . \nmurphy has changed his roles in recent years and not for the better . \nthere are hints of promise in this one . \nthe only time the film picks up even a little is when his shaved-headed character in the long flowing white caftan shows up on screen . \nthe others are horrendous . \ngoldblum has episodes of brilliance in his career , but here he seems to have been replaced with a lifeless pod from his \" invasion of the body snatchers \" . \nhis relationship with kate makes no sense . \nthey move from antagonism to love somewhere off screen . \npreston is as uninteresting as she could possibly be . \nsomewhere hidden deep inside of this film is about ten minutes of value . \nan attempt to satirize stupid television , we get a self-parody instead . \n", "m : i-2 , the sequel to mission impossible , is a james bond wannabe film , but it fails to even come close to that film in wit , humor , and entertainment value . \nit tries to be a spy/romance movie , but without any suspense the film just looks like it's an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses . \nit is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human . \nthe coolest thing about this movie , was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie , was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols . \nthe film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence . \nexcept for the choreographed action sequences , the film was dull for three-quarters of its time , filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed . \nas for the action scenes , they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films , but their advertisement for sadistic responses , is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence , which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen . \nm : i-2 opens and closes with fast-paced action scenes , but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue . \nthe film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus , at that point . \nthe only thing that kept me awake , was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the film's supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way . \nit's a mega-buck film adapted from a popular high-tech gadgetry tv series . \nbut its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it , and it failed to produce a story that had any substance . \njohn woo ( \" broken arrow \" / \" face/off \" ) is good at doing car chases , choreographed fights with midair flips and kung-fu kicks , slo-mo shots of two guns blazing , and of fire explosions , but he just can't seem to handle dialogue and suspense . \nthe star of the film and co-producer , tom cruise , and his romantic interest , thandie newton , are miscast . \ncruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile , as he tries to carry off this macho role , while thandie is not an action-film girl , and seems like a fish- out-of-water in this one . \ntheir romance didn't work , not only was it tepid and not sexy , but it wasn't convincing . \nthe film opens with dizzying speed , perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success . \nwe will be in three different locations instantaneously : sydney , the american southwest , and seville . \nfirst , we are in sydney , australia , where a scientist with a muffled russian accent , dr . nekhorvich ( rade ) , mentions that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it . \nhe also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain . \nwhich explains the film's mythic theme . . . as \nwe enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil . \nthe one who played the villain , dougray scott , does so in a one-dimensional gruff tone , which did not distinguish him in that role . \nat least , if the film got the villain part right , it might have had some fun with this nonsense . \nsoon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri , but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains . \nbefore they crash the plane and parachute out of it , the one who was posing as dimitri , turns out to be sean ambrose ( scott ) , a rogue member of the imf , which is a cia-like clone . \nhe steals the package with the antidote , peels off a latex mask , which is a replica of the hero of the story , ethan hunt ( cruise ) , who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust . \nsean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices . \nwe already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in face/off and in the original mission impossible , which as convoluted a plot as that film had , it was still a superior film to this sequel . \nwoo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground , as it is used so often in this film by both sides , so much so , that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain . \nit makes it seem as if anyone could be another character , which distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to make much sense . \nnext we are in a mountain range in the american southwest , and ethan is on vacation , hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool , when a helicopter with his boss anthony hopkins aboard , delivers via a rocket launcher , a pair of talking sunglasses . \nhunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agents to help , billy baird ( john polson ) and luther stickell ( ving rhames ) , with luther running a high-gadget computer , but he also must get a jewel thief named nyah hall ( thandie ) to join his team . \nhe is told , as an incentive to recruit her , all her criminal charges will be dropped . \nhopkins then signs off with the tag line : this message will self-destruct in five seconds . \nactually , with the departure of hopkins , it was this disposable film that actually self-destructed at this point . \nin seville , hunt recruits nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel heist and a subsequent car chase , where he nearly runs her audi sports car over the side of a mountain road . \nhe also falls for her when this was only supposed to be a business deal , and learns that she is valuable because her ex-boyfriend was sean ambrose and that he still wants to f * ck her . \nthe imf team then inject a location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go f * ck him , as she leads them to his hide-out in the seaside of australia in which he shares with his sneering villainous cohort , the south african , hugh stamp ( richard roxburgh ) . \nrobert towne , the screenwriter , who contributed to the first \" mission , \" who is noted for doing \" chinatown \" -- writes a colorless , pedestrian script , one that fails even to be funny in a camp way . \nthe terrorists , who aim to rule the world , are interested in owning 51 percent in a biotech company and in getting stock options , as they plan to infect sydney with the virus and have their company sell the antidote , insuring that they will make billions on the stock . \nethan comes to the rescue of the world and of nyah , with his only conflict being who is more important to save first . \nethan does this rescue against all odds , as he finds a way to penetrate a security tight biotech company , fight it out with sean and the other terrorists , and rescue nyah , who injected herself with the virus to hinder sean's getting it , as the only way to transport the virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle . \nethan rescues her by doing stunt riding on a motorcycle , using kick-boxing , winning a shootout , throwing a full john wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists , making some more use out of that peeling mask bit , and by being completely fearless and larger than life , while he kick's everyone's ass . \nif i was only entertained by this . . . i \ncould have lived with it . \nbut this film was so badly made , that it was like watching a highlight film of a basketball game , seeing only the slam-dunks , but with the game itself being excluded from the telecast . \nin any case , this is a critic-proof film , and will in all probability do well in the box office , as it was made to appeal to all the demographics who find commercial ventures like this one easy to buy into . \n", "ex-universal soldier luc has to battle a group of newer-model engineered fighters gone bad . \nthe review \njean-claude van damme has a one-liner early on in universal soldier : the return , his latest attempt to remain relevant , that sums up this entire movie ; he says \" been there , done that . \" \nno film critic could possibly sum up van damme's recent film choices any better . \nwhile other ageing action stars have wisely moved into other film genres ( schwarzenegger makes as many family comedies as he does action films ) , van damme stubbornly persists in sticking with what used to work for him : martial arts and guns . \nthis unwillingness or perhaps inability to move into new genres has caused van damme to enter the straight to video world , with legionnaire never seeing the inside of a multiplex . \nhe joins fellow martial artist/action star steven seagal as they watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away . \nuniversal soldier : the return is truly poor . \nthe plot is a complete copy of several action films from this decade , specifically terminator 2 : judgement day and the similarly named soldier . \nsoldier's kurt russell was an older model super-soldier sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors , for the good of a planet ; schwarzenegger's terminator in t2 tried to save john connor from a newer model killing machine , the t-1000 ; and jean-claude , a former universal soldier , has to save the planet from the rampage of a group of , you guessed it , newer model soldiers . \nconsidering the poor box office performance of soldier , it's amazing that this project was ever given the go-ahead . \nluc devereaux ( van damme ) was the sole remaining universal soldier ( or unisol for short ) , until he was returned to a normal , if muscular , human form . \nin this sequel ( technically the fourth film in the series , following two straight-to-video duds that were ignored here plot-wise ) , luc is now a human trainer/consultant of sorts for the unisol program . \nworking with dylan cotner ( xander berkeley , who interestingly also appeared in t2 ) , the unisol program has engineered a tougher , fiercer fighting force with the help of super-computer seth . \nunfortunately , upon hearing that the program has been axed by the government , seth takes control of his soldiers , killing everyone in the building except for luc , his partner maggie , his daughter hillary and erin , a reporter trapped inside . \nthe rest of the film involves luc trying to keep them all alive , while beating up a group of near-indestructible soldiers , most notably romeo ( popular wrestler goldberg ) . \nthere are lots of fights , gun battles , lame plot developments and a noticeable lack of plausibility . \nthere are so many clich ? s in this film that it is almost painful to watch . \nluc gets saddled with the task of saving erin the reporter early on , and in the course of a single night , they go from bickering to falling for each other , to kissing . \nerin is a pathetically-written character ; people are getting brutally gunned down all around her , and yet , not only does this not seem to frighten her , but she finds time to remind luc that she \" isn't leaving without her story \" . \nwhatever . \nother laughable moments include a ) luc going to a strip club to get internet access ( what ? ) and b ) a group of rangers , who after having been given good advice ( luc tells them that their weapons are useless , and shows them a specific gun which should work better ) , choose to go into battle with their useless weapons anyway ( guess who wins the battle ? ) . \nnot one single scene in universal soldier : the return has any originality to it . \nwhen fuelled by don davis' loud , driving music score , the film's many fights become almost passable , but mostly are full of the same ol' jean-claude moves . \ndirector mic rodgers ( a former stunt co-ordinator ) keeps the action coming at a rapid pace , with only a few token serious moments to be found . \nhis past work is evident in the many moments when characters are thrown through windows , tossed off of buildings or sent flying through the air thanks to an explosion . \nif only jean-claude weren't getting so old and slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like jet li , rodgers could probably have made a decent action film . \nto place the blame squarely at van damme's feet , however , is an injustice . \ni'm not sure that anyone , not even robert deniro or edward norton , could make writers william malone and john fasano's script sound good . \none particularly painful scene is when erin asks luc how he is so sure that the aforementioned strip club will have internet access . \nhe cringes , looks down and mutters \" uh . . . uhm . . . \nthey all do , i saw it on 60 minutes . \neh he he he \" the script's and indeed the entire film's only saving grace is goldberg . \nhe chews up every scene he is in , obviously enjoying his role immensely . \nhe even gives the film a few laughs , as he mutters things like \" i really don't like that guy \" every time he fails to kill luc . \nsadly , his presence is not enough to turn universal soldier : the return into anything better than a below-average action film that truly deserves to have joined its fellow sequels by going straight-to-video . \n", "the plot of big momma's house is martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress . \nthat's not just the high-concept premise ; it's the fully-realized , all-encompassing plot . \nsuch an emphasis is not unheard-of in the world of hollywood summer entertainment . \none need merely look back to last summer , when the plot of big daddy was adam sandler being an incompetent surrogate parent . \nthe trap inherent in such an approach is that the high-concept plot idea better be pretty well-realized , or rest on the shoulders of an extremely talented performer , because you can bet there will be nothing else worth a second of your time -- not a developed character , not a provocative theme , not a witty twist . \nyou will get 90-plus minutes of martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress -- nothing more , nothing less . \nthose who find martin lawrence more than an occasionally amusing screen presence may have a shot at enjoying the one-note dud that is big momma's house . \nothers will simply stare , mouth agape , at its sheer unapologetic laziness . \nlawrence plays fbi agent malcolm turner , an undercover expert on a stakeout assignment with his partner john ( paul giamatti ) . \ndangerous convicted bank robber and murderer lester vesco ( terrence howard ) has escaped from prison , and the feds think he's headed for his former girlfriend and presumed-but-never-proved accomplice sherry ( nia long ) . \nsherry , however , has fled with her son trent ( jascha washington ) , possibly to visit her grandmother hattie mae ( ella mitchell ) , better known as big momma . \nindeed , sherry appears to be on her way , but big momma is headed out of town without knowing sherry is coming . \nthat leaves master of disguise malcolm to go under very heavy cover as big momma and find out what sherry knows . \nbig momma's house's bloodlines are certainly traceable to mrs . \ndoubtfire -- director raja gosnell edited that film , and the makeup effects were similarly created by greg cannom -- but there's just as strong a whiff of tootsie in the main character's attempt to use his alternate identity to get closer to a woman . \nunfortunately , big momma's house makes a ridiculous decision neither of those other films made : instead of having the protagonist pose as a completely manufactured character unfamiliar to anyone elses , it places malcolm in the position of playing a friend and family member to several other characters . \nsuspension of disbelief in big momma's house requires you to believe every other person in the film is blind and/or stupid , since no one notices that one big momma looks or sounds absolutely nothing like the other . \nof course , laughs trumps logic every time , and big momma's house probably still would have worked in spite of its utter disdain for common sense if it had just managed to be funny . \nand it misses its best possible opportunity for some great farce by ignoring the simple fact that the real big momma is set up as a foul-tempered beast , while malcolm has to be nurturing in order to get the information he wants out of sherry . \nunfortunately , no one involved appears to have the faintest idea how to deal with the comic gold mine involved in one real person pretending to be another , very different real person , so they fall back on an endless parade of sight gags : malcolm reacting violently to big momma's explosive diarrhea attack ; malcolm-as-momma schooling a pair of cocky teens in basketball ; malcolm trying to avoid detection as various prostheses give way at inopportune moments ; malcolm delivering a baby because big momma is the town midwife ( one of the few sequences that works ) . \nmartin lawrence can be likeable enough at times , but there's no reason to care a whit about his budding romance with sherry because malcolm is never an independently significant character . \nhe's just big momma without the makeup on . \ni won't waste time commenting on how ineptly the set-up of the escaped convict is employed , since it was clearly a waste of time to the film-makers . \nthere are a few token scenes of lester looming as a threatening figure , but he's ultimately a distraction in a film that's really about its central visual incongruity ( and the accompanying lascivious glances at nia long's posterior ) . \ni'm never prepared to underestimate how appealing that idea may be to other people -- several million of them apparently found adam sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing -- but i know that when a film-maker tries to throw a concept at me and pretend that it's an entire film , i duck out of the way . \nthe gross implausibility of big momma's house might have been tolerable if it was seasoned with more big , cleverly-constructed laughs . \nits lack of big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all relevant . \nbig momma's house is ridiculous _and_ not funny . \nit's just a sad exercise in the jaded presumption that any scene should be considered wacky and hilarious if it involves martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress . \n", "starring william baldwin ; cindy crawford & steven berkoff all right , the first problem that fair game has is the casting of supermodel cindy crawford in the lead role . \nnot that cindy does that bad , it's just that anyone who watches this film knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was not done because of cindy's extraordinary acting skills , but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation . \nand in fair game most situations tend to find cindy either soaking wet or very hot and sweaty , but i'm sure that that is just a coincidence , no doubt that these situations were essential to the plot and the fact that cindy looks great wet , well , that's just a happy coincidence . \nsure . \nwilliam baldwin isn't a bad actor . \nunfortunately , he just doesn't demonstrate it at all in this movie . \ni'm not sure if that's because most of his lines were just so hokey , or if he was trying to make cindy's acting look good . \nif it was the latter , it worked . \ncindy does a surprisingly good job here in her first movie . \nwhich is not to say that she doesn't have room for improvement . \nalthough to be fair to cindy , her lines were kinda cheesy in places . \nso right about now you are no doubt asking yourself what sort of movie does cindy crawford , arguably the most beautiful woman on the planet , chose for her foray into the world of cinema ? \nwell , i'm glad you asked that question . \ncindy plays a lawyer who by some convoluted plot twists becomes a target for former elite kgb agents . \nwhy woud they target someone as likable as cindy , you ask ? \nby the end of the movie you won't care . \nthe story is so contrived it isn't funny . \nanyway after cindy gets blown out of the window of her house , without getting so much as a scratch i might add , she is placed into protective police custody under the watchful eve of william baldwin . \nwho's character , max kilpatric , a police detective , seems to possess the skills of some sort of fighting machine ( my guess is that the writers have seen way too many of steven seagal's early films ) . \nthe point is that the idea of the crawford and baldwin's characters of the run from these killer russians isn't all that bad of an idea , it's just everything around that basic idea which kinda stinks out loud . \nthe supporting cast members are nothing more that over acted stereotypes . \nif i was baldwin , i'd hope this film disappears . \nas for crawford , she may indeed have some acting ability . \nunfortunately , any she does have is obscured by writing that goes beyond bad . \nthis movie was obviously written with cindy in mind , since the writers spend most of their time finding ways to capitalize off of her looks . \nit's too bad they hadn't spent more time on a half decent plot , since ms . crawford is more than capable of looking just fine all by herself thank you very much . \nunless you are a huge fan of either baldwin or crawford this is a movie that will only disappoint you . \n", "take a look at the following equation . . . . \na christmas carol+ghostbusters=scrooged \nyes , scrooged is the odd mixture of sentiment , comedy and horror you would get if you mixed those two elements toghether . \nscrooged is alternatively sick , gross , funny , and then sickly soppy . \nbill murray plays frank cross , a t . v executive with a horrible personality . \nhe's evil to secretary , actors , crew , everyone , except the t . v's station's boss , of course ( played by the late robert mitchum ) however , he is then visited by a very dead exec , who warns cross that he will be visited by three ghosts , past , present and future ( who is called the ghost of yet to come , for some reason ) sure enough , they arrive , show cross how much of a s . o . b he is , and he changes his way . \nhowever , throughout this simple plot , we've got to suffer outlandish special effects , poor comedy , and an very , very mean performance from bill murray . \nfrank cross isn't 'funny' mean , he's just mean . \nhe also isn't very good at emotional scenes , and totally destroys the last ten minutes of the film , with an utterly desperate speech saying how great christmas is , and how he has changed . \nhowever , the supporting cast are ok , with good performances from mitchum , allen ( who plays his girlfriend ) and john glover ( who plays cross's 'partner' ) the ghost of christmas past isn't that bad either . \nsadly , though , the audience has to suffer 25 minutes of 'home alone' style violence from the ghost of christmas present , played by carol kane . \nwhoever thought smacking that kane smacking murray in the head with a toaster was funny , should be fired straight away . \nand the audience also has to suffer bobcat goldthwait ( the guy with the annoying voice in police academy 3 , if i remeber correctly . . . . ) \nwho , thankfully , dosen't say much . \nthe script is horrendous . \nmichael o'donaghue churns out terrible , bad taste jokes ( which i guess is the whole point really ) then changes direction completely to emotional scenes . \nand he must of been on some drug when he wrote the final ten minutes , which are awful . \nthe special effects look nice , but do nothing for the film . \nthere's some impressive make up effects also . \nthe music is also good , which is scored by danny elfman . \nbut great effects and make up don't make a great film . \nscrooged is an appaling attempt to inject some christmas spirit into the audience , seeing as the first 1 hour 20 minutes of the film are so depressing anyway , and the last ten minutes had to make up for it with an godawful speech . \nwhy didn't cross just look out his exec window , and ask a young boy to buy a goose for him ? \noverall , then , you'd have a much better christmas if you avoid this film like something that should be avoided ( perhaps a plague ) \n", "synopsis : a maniac , crazed by virulent microphage , slaughters more than twenty people , including a street gang and heavily-armed troops , with a small knife . \neven with a handgun , however , he can't take out the two cops who are after him , despite having shot one of them a total of seven times . \ncomments : the most notable aspect of adrenalin : fear the rush is that it marks a striking career move for natasha henstridge . \nnot only does she manage to keep all her clothes on ( her trademark in earlier films such as species and maximum risk was to strip naked as often as possible ) , but she actually puts on even more clothes as the film progresses . \nthis will probably disappoint many henstridge fans , but i welcome the change because henstridge is an attractive , capable actress who deserves less exploitative roles ( though , i admit , it doesn't show in this mess ) . \nhenstridge , just like every other actor in the film , delivers a wooden performance in this monumental turkey . \n ( the cast also includes christopher lambert , who has appeared in the highlander and mortal kombat films . ) \nhow on earth this movie got two big-name stars to appear in it is beyond me . \nadrenalin : fear the rush is set in boston ten years in the future ( 2007 ) . \nboston has changed dramatically in those ten years . \nit is now home to a bunch of interred foreigners and policed by cops who drive around in small cars with \" policia \" printed on their doors . \nsome guy has a really bad virus , and he's killing people because of it . \nso , the brave good guys ( lambert and henstridge ) go after him . \nthat's it . \n76 minutes never seemed so long . \nthis is a drawn-out chase scene through dimly-lit abandoned buildings turned into an entire movie . \nthe plot development is nil ; we learn absolutely nothing about lambert's character and very little about henstridge's character . \nthe dialogue is littered with unnecessary obscenities and concerns mindnumbingly idiotic arguments over who will go down the next dark corridor/tunnel/airduct next and who will carry the flashlight . \na subplot does exist involving henstridge's character's illegal attempt to get her son out of boston . \nin her opening monologue , a monologue which sounds as though henstridge was reading from cue cards , we learn that she has gone to great lengths to secure a fake passport for her son . \ntwenty minutes into the film , i wondered if the movie would have been better if it focused on this plot . \nin a defining scene of the movie , however , i changed my mind . \nthis fake passport drops to the ground . \nlambert's cop immediately recognizes it as a fraud from six feet away . \nmust not have been a good fake . \nthis emphasizes another fault with the film . \nthings just defy common sense . \nlambert's cop , for instance , is shot seven times , yet he is still able to talk and slide about . \nadrenalin : fear the rush ends in a trite manner that doesn't seem to even fit the mood that the filmmakers were trying for . \ni found myself rather bored with this film , which will disappoint both sci-fi/horror fans and fans of henstridge and lambert . \ndon't fear the rush . \nfear the movie . \nwatch something else . \n", "post-chasing amy , a slew of love-triangle movies : this month we have kissing a fool , co-starring amy's own lee , and april brings us the object of my affection , which may as well be titled chasing allan , for it is the story of a woman who falls in love with her gay roommate . \n ( to be absolutely six degrees of kevin bacon about it , that film stars schwimmer's friend jennifer aniston . ) \nif only kevin smith could write them all . . . \nschwimmer stars as womanizing chicago sportscaster max , who falls in love with his best friend jay ( lee ) 's book editor samantha ( avital ) a mere twenty-four hours after meeting her . \nthey are soon engaged , and max , because of his own raging libido , grows suspicious of samantha's fidelity . \nhe convinces jay to flirt with samantha during the development of his book , to \" test her \" . \nthe trouble is , jay might be secretly in love with her . \nto stretch this flat , sitcom premise to feature length , the plot is framed by a climactic wedding , at which bonnie hunt recounts the triangular tale--the events leading up to the nuptials--to an annoying fat man and his silly girlfriend . \nhunt has the best comic timing of anyone in the film ; schwimmer can spin bad dialogue into mildly humorous dialogue ; and lee , poor lee , is miscast . \nso hysterically funny in chasing amy , here he is forced to repress his comic instincts : to swear , to yell , to talk about oral sex . . . \nthe script's idea of a character trait is to stress that jay is a \" sensitive man \" , and then show him drinking pepto bismol when he's stewing over his girl trouble . \nas for avital , an israeli actress , she is warm and sweet , but we don't know anything about her character other than that it takes her an incredibly long time to realize the most obvious things . \nshe also too closely resembles the stunningly beautiful kari wuhrer , who plays schwimmer's assistant and personal temptress , turning that particular subplot into an unintentional riff on vertigo . \nthere are a handful , a smattering , of good scenes in kissing a fool . \ni enjoyed a moment in a comedy club , during which jay gets up and asks \" has anyone here ever hated their girlfriend so much you wanted to kill her ? \" \nover and over until he's booted off stage . \nthere are also a few obviously improvised lines that are fresher than anything that's on the page . \nkissing a fool is never as clever as the thursday night joke-machine friends that spawned schwimmer's movie career , so

despite its cast . \nthe \" surprise \" ending was sooo predictable . \nsince when is a male character's sudden outing of the closet considered a surprise in hollywood anymore ? ? \ngo is dawson's

, an illegal gambling lottery . \n \" runners \" take bets from potential lottery winners and deliver them to private locations for drawings . \nthe undisputed leader of the harlem numbers is the madame queen ( cicely tyson ) who is challenged by dutch schulz ( tim roth ) , a ruthless hoodlum . \nby turning against the queen , dutch defies his partner , the infamous lucky luciano ( andy garcia

a bodyguard for her . \nhe proves himself worthy in short time as he thwarts an assassination attempt ( on himself and the queen ) , and later takes control of the queens army when she is jailed for

new army questions his methods . \nhis girlfriend ( vanessa l . williams ) and the queen disagree with his violent solutions . \nmost importantly ( in his eyes ) , dutch has become a more formidable foe than he imagined , and seeks help from lucky luciano to assassinate him . \nthere have been so many movies dealing with organized crime that it must be hard to write an original story dealing with it . \nthis movie is not original at all . \nin fact , i was angered by how many similarities there was between this film and , arguably , the best gangster movie of all time , the godfather . \nif you are going to borrow ideas from another movie and not give credit , why not borrow from a lesser known movie ( say , millers crossing ? ) . \nhow could the credited screenwriter chris brancato not give credit to mario puzo himself ? \nhere are just some of the major similarities ( i stopped counting at 10 ) . \ncrooked cop assaults blood relative of the leader . \ngang extracts revenge on crooked cop . \nwife ( or girlfriend ) questions her partners' murderous activities and leaves him . \nhigh ranking \" officer \" betrays the leader . \nblood relative of the leader murdered . \nwar erupting between the \" families \" . \nhigh-ranking officer disapproves of the leader in front of other family members . \nnew leader runs family differently from previous leader . \nlarge meeting with all families involved . \nthe setup in this movie is done rather well . \ni enjoyed the portrayal of the network of \" runners \" sprinting through the streets collecting bets for the queens lottery . \nthis was the way of life in harlem , and most people involved with the queen did so because it was the only way to support their families and put food on the table . \nnumber running was the only way for the harlem population to find work . \ni also enjoyed the interaction between the angry , violent dutch and the calm , patient lucky . \nafter about the 30-40 minute mark all of the similarities with the godfather start appearing , one after the other ( and in short order ) . \nit was a huge distraction , and an insult to my intelligence . \nwho was the screenwriter kidding here ? \nsome of the individual performances were well done . \nandy garcia was very convincing as lucky , unfortunately his screen time is reduced to a supporting role . \ntim roth effectively plays the cocky villain , much like his roles in \" the cook , the thief , his wife and her lover \" and \" rob roy \" . \nthe good performances and convincing setup during the first third of the movie do not

\nits plotline goes like this : the evil king cromwell , desiring to take over the world , resurrects an evil , ancient sorceror , xusia for power . \nhe attacks the kingdom of eh-dan and kills young prince talon's parents . \ngiven a triple-bladed sword ( which can shoot bad guys , like a gun ) by his dying father , talon vows for revenge . \neleven years later , when he's established his own army , the mercaneries , he vows to take back his kingdom . \nalong the way , he meets up with alana , whose village is attacked by drunken guards and her brother is kidnapped by cromwell . \ntalon vows to help , and , after a series of minor escapades , eventually ends up rescuing alana's brother ( and several other prisoners ) , only to be captured himself ( in other words , put on a cross to be crucified ! ) . \nfortunately he frees himself , rescues alana from marrying cromwell , defeats xusia , and then cromwell , all with his triple bladed sword ( during the final battle , the blade breaks , but talon finishes cromwell off by using a hidden dagger in the blade ) . \nthen , everything ends happily . \nunfortunately , the sword and the sorcerer is not even half as good as it sounds . \nwhat would have been a great film is completely destroyed by uneven plot jumping , bad acting , and gruesomely gory , bloody scenes . \nnever once does the story seem to connect together , it just jumps around repeatedly . \nthis problem is extremely noticeable in the opening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia . \nafter telling him that he needs his help , he leads the warlock out into daylight , but then stabs him and sends him careening off a cliff afterwards . \nwait a minute , didn't the plotline say that he needs the help of xusia in order to invade eh-dan , which he cannot do by military force ? \nif that is the case , why does he dispose of xusia after resurrecting him ? \nand why does he manage to take over eh-dan anyway ? \nthese questions are just never - no , never - answered in the film . \nanother example is that one moment we see talon fighting for his life , another moment we see him just about to be crucified during alana's wedding to cromwell ( ! ) , and finally at the end , instead of settling down with alana , he just tells her to \" wait \" , and then he just rides off ! \nin addition to the extremely bloody scenes , this uneven plot jumping completely destroys what would have been a great fantasy adventure . \neven some attempts to make it exciting , a few fire scenes , battle scenes , don't work . \nit just completely fails altogether miserably . \nthe only good thing about this film is its musical score , contributed by david whittaker , who had an ( extremely ) short music composing career . \nthe score is boomy and adventurous , powerful , and a billion times better than this film is . \nmy suggestion : steer the hell away from this bloody mess and buy the soundtrack album instead ( if you can find it ) . \nironically , though , before the film's credits roll , there is a message indicating that a sequel , tales of the ancient empire , would follow . \nto my relief ( and delight ) , it never got into production , because the sword and the sorcerer laid an egg at the box office , grossing only $39 million . \ncritics were right on in slamming the sword and the sorcerer , all right . \nleonard maltin rightfully called it \" second rate in scripting , and acting \" and at-a-glance film reviews called it \" a confusing , stupid , unimaginative , unengaging , bloodfilled bore \" . \ni totally agree with these reviews , all right , and i hope that this piece of #$% ! \nwill be forgotten about . \nthere are far better fantasy movies than the sword and the sorcerer . \ni hope you get a good laugh out of this review , but i am not laughing . \nin fact , my insults don't even come close to the gruesome sickness that this film gave me throughout its 100 minute running time . \n", "this movie stinks ! \nalthough it is professionally crafted and there are some decent performances , the plot is so bad it drags the film into the abyss . \ni knew i was in for trouble when , during the opening establishment shots , we see a detailed close-up of warrant officer paul brenner's ( john travolta ) military identification card and it is the wrong color . \nthis might seem like a minor detail , but anyone who has spent anytime with the military knows that active duty identification cards are green and dependant cards are yellow . \nand what about the senior military officer whose uniform shirt is so wrinkled he looks like he is a recruit on his first day of training . \nor what about when brenner tells a suspect that , because he is in the military , he doesn't have the right not to answer his questions even though these rights were central to military law well before the miranda decision . \nhow hard is it to get someone familiar with the military to check these facts ? \nnow details like this could be overlooked if the underlying story held up , but this story is so full of holes it is painful to sit through . \nfor example , at the beginning of the film , paul brenner , an undercover army investigator , gets into a gun and knife battle at his off-post houseboat and winds-up killing an arms dealer he had been investigating . \nthe local police investigating the death are openly hostile to the military and they discover that brenner has been lying to them about the killing . \nbut instead of arresting him , or at least take him into custody for further questioning , they release him . \nduh ! \nultimately , brenner gets assigned to investigate the murder and possible rape of the commanding general's daughter , a young captain also assigned to the post . \nwhen brenner finds graphic sex tapes featuring the general's daughter , does he use them to generate a suspect list and begin grilling suspects . \nno , his instinct is to suppress them because they might be potentially embarrassing . \neventually , brenner discovers that this murder is related to a violent gang rape at west point eight years earlier . \ni won't even go into the totally unbelievable rationale for the army's suppression of this horrendous crime . \ni will just mention one final flaw . \nbrenner is investigating a crime that occurred in georgia . \nthe rape occurred in west point , which is in new york . \nhe is under a very tight ( and totally implausible ) 36-hour deadline to solve this case . \nhe needs to discuss the rape with a psychiatrist at west point . \ndoes he phone the doctor ? \nno , he travels ( via some unexplained very fast transport ) to new york to question the psychiatrist in person , and then he returns to georgia ( again by the miracle transport ) , without once worrying about the impact any of this will have on his deadline . \nyou have been warned , stay away from this one . \n", " \" it was not scary . \" \nthese are the first words that came to mind after it was over . \nwhen a movie is called _vampires_ , \" not scary \" aren't words that should be associated with it . \nbut that wasn't my only gripe . \njohn carpenter is a name associated with cutting-edge cinema , as in the intense scares of _halloween_ , _the thing_ and _the prince of darkness_ , or the offbeat action of _they live_ and _escape from new york_ . \nunfortunately , the only thing that is cutting edge about _vampires_ is the level of boredom the movie is able to reach . \nwith an anemic plot and not-quite-kosher special effects , _john carpenter's vampires_ has barely enough substance to slake the thirst of even the least discerning genre fan . \nthe film is at first concerned with a group of roaming vampire slayers , led by james woods , of all people . \nlike some sort of holy a-team ( they even have their own souped-up van ) , the bunch invade and wipe out a nest of vampires in a new mexico shack . \ntheir method is amusingly innovative : the blood-suckers are reeled out with harpoons so they can flare up in the sun like matchsticks . \nto commemorate their victory , the loutish band decorates a motel room with hookers and parties the night away . \ntheir celebration is short-lived , however , as a master vampire named valek ambushes and single-handedly destroys most of the team . \nwoods' jack crow and buddy montoya ( daniel baldwin ) escape with their lives , along with a woman named katrina ( sheryl lee ) . \nalthough the woman has been bitten , montoya and crow decide to keep katrina for her psychic link to the master vampire . \nthe rest of the movie is concerned with the boys' hunt for valek ( thomas ian griffith ) , a freaky marilyn manson-type who's on a mission that dates back 600 years . \nalong the way they pick up a priest named guiteau ( tim guinee ) , a character who serves pretty much the same purpose as the jittery cpl . \nupham in _saving private ryan_ . \nsome stuff happens in the middle of the movie , but i can't remember most of it , because i often found a twitching hair in the corner of the frame more interesting than what was happening on screen . \n_vampires_ finally starts to pick up about 90 minutes into the mix , as crow , guiteau , and montoya assault an abandoned prison-turned vampire nest . \nonly then does the film begin to even resemble a carpenter flick . \nbut it's too little too late . \nwe get the inevitable final confrontation , but it seems tacked on and rather anti-climactic ( come on , we're dealing with _the_ master vampire here ! ) \ninterestingly , last summer's vampire actioner _blade_ was derived from a comic book , and _vampires_ from a novel , yet the latter seems more steeped in campy cheesiness than the former , a more deliberate superhero flick . \nwoods' jack crow spouts glib off-the-cuff one-liners and strolls away from exploding buildings with that oh-so-cool stride . \nand his motive for killing vampires ? \ntake a wild guess . \n ( hint : a ______ killed his _____ when he was just a _____ . ) \nat least _blade_ had decent action and slick stylishness . \n_vampires_ lacks even cheap thrills to mask its gossamer-thin plot . \nto make up for this , the movie resorts to other \" shocks , \" such as its generally condescending attitude towards women ( crow slaps them around for the fun of it ) and an overplayed contempt for religion ( crow teases guiteau incessantly about whether his vow of celibacy has made him prone to \" getting woodies . \" ) \nit can be argued that maybe i wanted too much from this movie . \nif not scary and gory , i wanted tense , relentless , and exhausting . \n_john carpenter's vampires_ is none of these . \ni can only recommended it for the hardcore carpenter fan . \nfor the rest of you looking for a good scare , beware : _vampires_ is a film with no teeth . \n", "perhaps best remembered as the recently departed news anchor on saturday night live who always started the segment with \" . . . this is the fake news , \" norm macdonald , at times , could elicit some laughter by blurting out semi-offensive phrases in his raspy voice , coated with a condescending attitude . \nhis shtick was marked by crassness . \nin this movie , for example , when his girlfriend says that she's kicking him out because he's been fired from 14 different jobs over the last 3 months , he tries to calm the situation by saying , \" maybe you'll feel better after we have some dirty sex . \" \nthis kind of humor can only go so far , but certainly can't go the distance in a full-length feature . \n \" dirty work \" , is nothing more than a sophomoric comedy about two best friends who grow up only physically . \nemotionally , they've never outgrown their pubescent years , which is somewhat amusingly explored in a beginning flashback . \nalthough having no apparent real world skills , the one thing that these two have always been adept at is getting back at people . \nif the meter maid was unjust in giving you a ticket , then dump a bunch of unpopped kernels of corn onto the engine block and watch the car burst apart . \nmitch ( norm macdonald ) and sam ( artie lange ) need to come up with $50 , 000 in a period of two weeks so that sam's dad ( jack warden ) can have a heart operation . \ntheir idea is to start a revenge-for-hire business where they'll do your dirty work . \nin the funniest scene ( and possibly the only funny scene ) of the movie , they take advantage of a live television shoot at a nearby used car lot . \ntheir presence is established , but when a less-than-honorable real estate developer hires them and then reneges on the payment , the two go to work to exact their sordid brand of revenge . \nby default , dirty work should treat us to some outrageous revenge plots , but it delivers jerky boys level material . \nexcept for the bit at the used car lot ( and possibly another episode that involves frat brothers ) , the dirty work is uninspired and becomes about as funny as a prank phone call . \nalready weak on material , it further spirals itself towards the video store by having jack warden constantly blurt out that he has an unsatisfied libido and needs 'broads' and also includes a very unfunny chevy chase as a bumbling doctor with a gambling addiction . \nbut what's really painfully evident is that norm macdonald has no versatility as an actor . \nrelying on his trademark of speaking into his personal recorder and saying \" note to self \" ( \" note to self : learn to fight , \" he says after getting beat up ; \" note to self : there's always beer , \" he says after hitting rock bottom ; etc . ) , we feel like we're just watching an elongated rehash of his not-so-glorious days on saturday night live . \nmuch like the television show , for 90 minutes we get one or two funny bits . \nthe rest of the story is just dead space . \n", "summer movies are , by nature , dumb affairs that are usually made for some quick enjoyment and to make money . \nwild wild west , the latest will smith affair , follows much the same formula , except that it is dumber and less enjoying than most summer movies . \nwill smith plays jim west , a black sheriff with a nice line in sunglasses . \nhe is called by president grant ( kline ) to go on a mission to find out why top government scientists are disappearing . \nwest is paired up with scientist artemus gordon ( kline again ) and the two track the missing scientists to a legless mastermind , named dr . loveless ( branagh , with a zany moustache . ) \nbefore i pile on with the many negatives in this sorry affair , i'll give it a chance with the positives . \nthere's a nice credit sequence , the production design by bo welch is pleasing to the eye , and the special effects are decent enough . \nthere's also a pleasant soundtrack . \nburied deep in the dross are one or two amusing jokes . \nand salma hayek pops up as the female interest , which is always nice to see . \napart from these factors , though , nothing else in wild wild west works . \nfirstly , there's little chemistry between smith and kline , who appears to be in it purely for the money . \none would expect zingers passing between the two : none arise . \nboth of them plod through the below standard plot , knowing that there is a pay cheque waiting at the end . \nnot even kenneth branagh provides much entertainment : although he is over the top , the material doesn't present much opportunity for branagh to be truly crazy . \ntherefore , he just comes across as loud as obnoxious . \nthe only enjoyable performance comes from the sexy salma hayek , who is given so little screen time it's embarrassing . \nshe appears to be in the film to merely show off her body , and be ogled at by kline and smith . \nher character also changes at a whim to fit the mechanics of the script , and there is no sense of realism about the character . \nthe 'humour' in the film is also very off . \nwill smith put a little spin to his daft lines in men in black , here , not even smith could save the humour on display . \nthe script largely boils down to insults that aren't very funny , and one-liners that barely raise a smirk . \nit's also somewhat racist , although it doesn't intend to be , with one scene with jim west trying to wisecrack his way out of a lynching , and actually says slavery is good to save himself . \nit's not a funny scene , and the whole thing comes off rather uncomfortably . \nthe film also makes the tragic mistake that a man ( in this case kline ) in a dress is automatically unfunny , it isn't , but the wild wild west makes this joke even more painful to watch through pure ineptness . \nthere's also problems with the plot . \njim west and artemus gordon get caught up in all kinds of sticky situations , but the way they get out of them are always unsatisfying , and rely purely on luck , rather than audience pleasing skill . \nplot elements are introduced into the film , and then thrown away just as quickly . \nthe main piece of the story , a 80 foot mechanical , steam driven spider devised by loveless looks rather impressive , but there's no particular reason why it should be built . \nwhy not loveless build a great big tank , instead of an ungainly , fragile piece of machinery that's just begging to be blown up ? \ndirector barry sonnenfeld always has a breezy look to them , with some nice camera tricks , but even this is missing from this stilted affair . \nwild wild west could have benefited from sonnenfelds whacked out style of directing , but not much of it is evident , making this film drag out even more . \nit's a sad thing when _four_ ( credited ) screenwriters , a talented director and a willing star can't make a film work , and eventually wild wild west collapses under it's sexist , mildly racist , unfunny weight . \n", "what were they thinking ? \nnostalgia for the seventies is bad enough , but do we really need an eighties film ? \nrobbie hart ( adam sandler ) used to want to be a rock and roll star , but in 1985 he's singing at weddings and having a good time . \na romantic at heart , he loves weddings and is just about to get married to his high-school sweetie . \nwhen she leaves him waiting at the altar , his tune changes to \" love stinks \" . \nhe meets waitress julia ( drew barrymore ) who is engaged to a junk-bonds salesman and you know that they are going to get together . \nin fact you know everything that is going to happen during this movie . \nsandler is somewhat adequate in his leading man role , but there is no spark . \nbarrymore doesn't seem to be able to convey anything other than a pretty face with nothing behind it : beauty but no attitude . \nboth characters are just there . \nbit parts by steve buscemi and jon lovitz steal the show . \nthe eighties are shoved in our face . \nreferences to deloreans , madonna , \" dallas \" , ivana and donald , burt and loni and \" miami vice \" get old fast . \nthe filmmakers must have realized that there wasn't much entertainment to the story and thought they could dazzle the audience with humorous period allusions . \nthey're not funny and it doesn't work . \nwith change on all fronts accelerating more and more , nostalgia appears to have a great appeal , but don't you think we could have more than 14 years before we yearn for the past . \nmaybe we can look forward to a film next year waxing nostalgically about el nino . \n ( michael redman has written this column for over 23 years and he knows that nostalgia is not what it used to be . ) \n", "and just when you thought joblo was getting a little soft around the corners , not rating anything lower than your standard \" this movie sucks \" , along comes this cinematic atrocity and he's forced to take out his secret weapon and spray it with a stench so thick , even the bravest movie-goer would think twice about seeing this waste of time . \nyes , despite being a third sequel to a successful original movie , the latest highlander doesn't seem to have anything going for it . \noh stinky movie , let me count thee ways . . . \nplot : ( from what i understood ) a really bad highlander dude comes to the present looking to whack out the nice highlander dudes in order to gain their power and become the mightiest immortal . . . or \nsomething along those lines . \ncritique : a complete and utter mess . \ndisjointed , incoherent , boring , corny , filled with bad dialogue . . . and \nthat's just the first thirty minutes ! \nthis film doesn't seem to know what to do with itself . \nit's confusing to anyone who doesn't know the series ( i include myself in that group ) and apparently idiotic to those who do know the series ( i include die-hard highlander fan the arrow in that group ) . \nthe film doesn't explain anything about itself . . . it \njust goes from one inexplicable situation to another . \none moment they're in the present time , the next moment , they're in italy in the 1600s . \nwhy ? \nwho knows . \nwhat are they talking about ? \nno idea . \nflashbacks mixed in with the present , mixed in with a few spontaneously cheesy fight sequences every now and again , and i even remember seeing one flashback scene which went even further into its own flashback scene ! ! \nhullo . . . ? ! ? \nconfused yet ? \ni was and i basically stopped giving a crap about anyone in the film when i realized that neither the writer or director was interested in presenting me with any kind of semblance of a story . \nrandom swordplay , mad max-like dudes showing up in motorcycles in the 1800s ? \nor were they in the present at that time ? \nwho knows . . . and to be honest . . . who \nseriously cares ! \nthis series should have been shot in the head and put out of its own misery a long time ago , but sadly , someone at the studio decided that it still had a little life left in it . \nplease , please . . . for the love of god and all that is holy in the world of movie-making , and mostly out of respect for those who loved the original film , put this series to bed and end it ! \neven christopher lambert knew enough to play second fiddle to adrian paul in this one . \nthe director also tries to do the best he can with the muddled material , but all he could come up with is plenty of slo-mo action , some fast-motion fight scenes and lots of smoke everywhere . \nand is there anything spectacular about the sword-play or fight scenes ? \nnope . \nand i think we all could have done without all those zooming lambert face close-ups . . . yipes , \nthe man is not aging gracefully , is he ? \noh boy , and i haven't even gotten around to the greatest piece of over-acting that i've seen in years . \nthe man who plays kell in this movie , bruce payne , should get a ham trophy for literally chewing up every piece of scenery that he gets near . \noveracting is not a hobby for this guy . . . it's \na living ! \nhe's also very funny , not purposely though . \nall in all , the movie stinks . \nnuff said . \n", "`bats' is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror movie fan . \nto pull something like this off , you need to have a sense of wit and style , with a heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if the fright factor ever declines . \nsomething like the underground worm thriller `tremors' had just the perfect mixture of these elements , and in return , the film was tremendous fun . \nwith the notable exception of a wisecracking supporting player , `bats' mainly plays it's premise for straight-arrow horror . \njudging by the ridiculous premise , this was not exactly a wise move . \nthe movie attempts to capture the essence of alfred hitchcock's `the birds' , but fails miserably . \ndone right , it could have been adequately amusing halloween cinema . \nunfortunately , `bats' is a prime example of a formula movie done terribly , terribly wrong . \nthe only thing amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate their core audience to be . \ni will recite the following paragraph in a manner that will reach the audience of individuals to whom `bats' is aimed toward . \nthose guys in hollywood have made a movie about bats . \nthese bats are not very nice , because they eat a lot of people . \nboy , are these bats ugly . \nthey are infected with this bogus virus that makes them super-duper smart . \nthey've got big claws and red eyes and they are not very friendly at all . \na whole bunch of people in texas get killed , so a sheriff guy and a scientist lady are brought in to kill the bats . \nthey have big guns and other cool things to fight them with , but the bats are pretty smart , so it's sorta hard to do . \nthe bats swoop down and they shoot at them to make they go away for good . \nbut no , `bats' is probably too violent for pre-schoolers . \nthe film , directed by louis morneau , should have ventured straight into video stores . \non the small screen , perhaps more fun could have been derived with lower expectations . \nbut sitting through this crapper on the big screen is almost awkward ; although at a few moments it becomes a guilty pleasure , the film is poorly written , poorly acted and executed with glaring ineptitude . \neven the bats themselves are cheesy , and the attack sequences too rushed and jittery to be properly enjoyed . \nthe sheriff in the story is emmett kimsey ( lou diamond phillips ) , who embodies every pathetic stereotype a small-town authority figure usually portrays ( he chomps on a cigar , struts contentedly in his boots , etc . . . ) . \nthe scientist is dr . sheila casper ( dina meyer ) , who specializes in flying mammals and is classified as `the best in her field' . \nmeyer uses a lot of technical terms designed to make the movie seem more intellectually capable , but everything about dr . casper is recycled beyond recognition . \nher memories of how she became hooked on the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like oceanographic student matt hooper's tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in `jaws' . \neverything revolving around `bats' is tired drivel , which desperately requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up . \nthe supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw , with voices dubbed in later . \nin fact , that may have worked out better in the end . \ntake one glance at casper's bat-loathing sidekick jimmy ( leon ) , and you'll have immediate deja vu - he's the exact same humorous buddy caricature from every other movie , constructed specifically for timed comic relief . \nunfortunately , none of his comic interludes are funny . \nin the role of deranged mad scientist dr . mccabe , the reliable bob gunton gets cornered with the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch . \nmccabe `accidentally' released two experimental test subjects , and the virus spread to other bats . \nthe entire town of gallup , texas is under attack from an enormous swarm of the creatures , but gunton appears to be inconspicuously contemplating something else . \nsomething like : `when is the damn movie going to be over ? ? \ni just want my money . ' \nthe bats are ugly , i must say . \nthere's the occasional moment where they look moderately convincing , but mainly , the swarm is represented in cheesy digital imagery . \nonly bits of the bloody action even hint at the campy fun the film could have been , but by the absurdly stupid climax , it's way too late in the game for a decent recovery . \ncharacters experiment in slaughtering the bats with gunfire . \nlet's explore the logic there : is this really a very efficient way to decrease the bat population ? ? \nyou could empty an entire clip at the flying winged serpents and not even wound one , and after that there are only 18 , 000 more of them . \nthis kind of behavior represents the regular level of intelligence behind `bats' . \n", "the most interesting part of \" can't hardly wait \" just happens to be not only the most human , but for many of us , the one part that many of us can easily relate to . \nthat is the character of denise ( lauren ambrose ) , the film's sole sarcastic member who mocks everything that goes on in the film , and at one point sits down on a couch and looks totally bored . \nthe film wisely holds over this moment , nicely showing her alienation in the midst of a large high school party . . . almost \ntoo nicely . \nfor some members of the audience ( read : me ) , this is basically a mirror of what's going on with them watching this film . \nwe sit there wondering why we've even bothered to see a film about a long high school party we probably never felt the desire to go to in the first place . \ni would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this . \nafter all , this film is filled with a bunch of pathetic stereotypes much of which i went to high school with . \neveryone's here : the jock , the homecoming queen , the nerd ( and his dominions of trekkies and x-philes ) , the alienated wannabe writer , the school spirit girl , the pothead ( s ) , the wigger , etc , etc , etc , and weirdly enough this film shows them as superficial , lame , and basically as a bunch of losers . \nexcept for denise , who rolls her eyes at everything , and easily becomes the most likable character even before she speaks ( her yearbook entry , something which is done for each main character , quotes oscar wilde - definite pointers there ) . \nunfortunately , the writers and directors take several major misteps on the way to making this into an admirable and even likable film . \nthe film , as i said , portrays most of its characters as superficial and just totally ignorant to everything . \nhowever , instead of sticking with this , perhaps even going a bit further with it , they let this lie , and actually make these characters into our heroes . \nwe follow several of them , all a bunch of moronic stereotypes with only a shread of humanity and realism , and tries to tell boring and overly melodramatic tales about them as if we actually cared and/or identified with them . \nand if we did , we certainly don't want to revisit that state of being . \nhere's a quick low-down : it's graduation , and we follow a bunch of seniors on the last night , otherwise known as the \" american grafitti \" or , to a lesser extent , the \" dazed and confused \" cliche . \nthe formal just followed them as they drove aimlessly ; the latter did a little bit of that and featured a big outdoor keg party . \n \" can't hardly wait \" just opts for a big indoor keg party , and a little bit of aimless driving , albeit of the i'm-whining-because-i-can't-get-a-girl-i-want brand . \nwe follow many people around , but mostly we trail preston ( ethan embry , of \" that thing you do ! \" ) , the alienated writer , who's been pining over the homcoming queen , amanda ( the totally overrated jennifer love hewitt ) , for the entirety of high school because he thinks they shared a moment their freshman year over a freaking pop tart . \nnow that she's broken up with her football player boyfriend , mike ( peter facinelli ) , he decides to go to the party with a note he's written declaring his \" love \" for her in the hopes he'll build up the guts to give it to her . . . even \nthough he's leaving for a multi-week intensive writing program hosted by none other than kurt vonnegut ( okay : the ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson ? ) . \nsince that plot is incredibly lame and a track record of what goes on with it wouldn't be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film , and because it's a party , there are some more main characters , such as : william ( charlie korsmo , finally surfacing after \" dick tracy \" ) , the nerd ( and his dominions ) who has come up with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike , who's humiliated him for years , but gets too caught up in drinking to do it ; kenny ( seth green ) , the wigger , who has decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid ( uh huh ) ; and denise , the only exceptional character , who unfortunately gets stuck in a bathroom ( don't ask ) with kenny where the two characters let down their characters and are allowed to follow the laws of plot cliches from point a to point b with nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile . \nugh . \nthe main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not \" american grafitti \" or \" dazed and confused , \" two films that embraced and ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers ( not to mention were extremely entertaining ) , but to john hughes films of the 80s , most notably \" sixteen candles . \" \nthe big difference in the two is that that film managed to not only embrace but even satirize its main characters , and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion . \nthis film forgets to satirize its characters , and ultimately tells a story about a bunch of uninteresting stereotypes . . . and \nthen says that it's all okay . \nwe can't take this film seriously , nor can we take this as fun , so really what good is it ? \nbut i will tell you some things i did like : i liked the direction , except for a couple too-over-the-top features , like way-too-glossy jump cuts ( it's like an oxymoron ) and other obscurities . \ngenerally , though , elfont and kaplan do have graceful camera movement , and even manage to capture an altman-esque feel to their film from time to time ( a thing with a note , though , is too hokey to really be admirable ) . \ni actually did like seth green , for once in about a decade ( when he played a very young woody allen in \" radio days \" ) - his desintegration of his wigger character was almost believable . . . almost . \nand , of course , lauren ambrose is wonderful as denise , the one character we could have used some more of , even though it would have changed the entirety of the film . \nhowever , the character of denise really doesn't work with the film , when really thought about . \nshe's far too witty and realized ( at least for the first half ) to belong in this film , and whenever she appears , she automatically gives everything a delightfully satirical tone . \nshe's not just the cynic or the intellectual ; she's just a very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged characters . \nshe may ruin the film more , but at least when she's on screen we can sit up and think to ourselves \" well , at least we'll be entertained . \" \na couple other things that just don't work : mike's character , who suffers an epiphany throughout the film but in the end acts as though he has forgotten everything : too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general ; the aimless , bitchy driving by preston to try and get over his inability to shack up with amanda - give me a break ; and perhaps the one thing that just doesn't work at all : jenna eflman's uncredited cameo as an angel - just didn't work , but nice try . \nbasically the worst thing about this film , the real reason i'm giving this such a low rating , is because it refuses to give us any fully realized characters and then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything we'd do . \nwe don't feel for these characters because for most of us , we aren't stereotypes going through the motions to worn subplots . \nthe acid test for high school movies is : does it at all capture the feel of what it's portraying ? \nthe answer for this film is no . \nnice try , though . \n", "the film may be called mercury rising , but that title doesn't describe the trajectory taken by this motion picture , a routine thriller that combines government cover-ups with a cloying and poorly-motivated buddy story . \nthe \" hook \" that is supposed to make mercury rising unique is that the young protagonist is autistic . \nhowever , aside from giving actor miko hughes a chance to win raves for his performance , this particular aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than a convenient plot device . \nthose expecting to see even a semi-thorough exploration of the condition will be disappointed . \nmercury rising treats autism with the same degree of efficiency that many action thrillers accord to alcoholism . \nthe script for mercury rising is exceptionally tiresome and hard- to-swallow . \ni don't know whether the problem is in the original book , simple simon , or in the screenplay adaptation , but this movie easily exceeds the intangible threshold beyond which a suspension of disbelief is no longer possible . \nonce again , certain standby plot elements -- the high-level government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent -- are recycled , and not to good effect . \nwhile bruce willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in hollywood , this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little tension and too much nonsense . \nthe story begins with a formulaic sequence in which the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold , art jeffries ( bruce willis ) , is confronted with his own failure . \nunable to resolve a hostage crisis in time , he is forced to observe as two teenagers are shot to death . \nthe event weighs heavily on his conscience and heavy-handedly establishes his motivation for protecting 9-year old simon lynch ( miko hughes ) when he discovers the autistic child hiding in a closet after his parents have been gunned down by the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player . \nsoon , art and simon are on the run from seemingly everyone -- fleeing for their lives and bonding at the same time , with the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player always just a step behind them . \nalong the way , they are helped by the best friend who defies orders to help out his buddy ( chi mcbride ) and the supporting female who may or may not become a love interest ( kim dickens ) . \nwhy is simon in danger and why were his parents turned into swiss cheese by the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player ? \napparently , the government has spent millions of dollars developing an ultra-secret code called \" mercury . \" \nto make sure it can't be cracked , they do the most intuitive thing possible : place a sample of it in a \" nerds' puzzle magazine . \" \nof course , no one can solve it -- no one except autistic simon , that is . \nwhen he calls the phone number listed in the solution , he gets the nsa . \nas a result , the cold-hearted , sneering government man ( alec baldwin ) decides that simon has to be eliminated -- for the good of the country , of course . \nbut he hasn't counted on the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold , even though everyone in the audience has . \nit's hard to get worked up about a routine thriller that doesn't do anything exceptionally well , and does quite a few things rather poorly . \nfor those who are desperate to find elements of this movie to like , mercury rising manages to manufacture tension from time-to-time , but even the most exciting scenes ( such as the one where art and simon are crouched down , avoiding passing trains ) aren't that pulse-pounding . \nthe climactic struggle is a real ho-hum affair which leads to a finale that is painful in its obviousness . \noverall , director harold becker is constantly struggling ( and failing ) to generate even a moment that isn't derivative or obligatory . \nbruce willis' star seems to be fading . \nthis is his fourth straight lackluster outing , following last man standing , the fifth element , and the jackal . \nwillis isn't terrible , but this is the kind of role he can sleepwalk through , and often does . \nalec baldwin , combining elements of his characters from glengarry glenn ross and malice , does some scenery- chewing , but his performance is surprisingly lacking in menace . \nthe film's real star is young miko hughes ( heather langenkamp's son in wes craven's new nightmare ) , who does as good a job as dustin hoffman playing an autistic individual , but is about 50 years younger . \nmercury rising joins the likes of hard rain , the replacement killers , and u . s . marshals on the heap of pallid 1998 thrillers . \nfor those who like action and adventure in the theater , this has not been a good year . \nhopefully , the advent of summer will change that . \nuntil then , the best choices ( for bruce willis or any other action hero ) are on video . \nand , if you're determined to see mercury rising , check out the morning sky in early may . \n", " \" alcohol and drugs = bad . \nnot alcohol and drugs = good . \ngot it ? \" \njust when you though you've seen enough of brave young women dealing with their personal problems on screen , be that insanity or alcoholism , hollywood releases yet another one of those 'deep , emotional stories about finding yourself' . . \n'28 days' is practically a visualization of the usual 'meaningful' true stories that people are so proudly retelling at aa-meetings . \ngwennie ( sandra bullock ) is a young woman who drowned her problems in alcohol . \nfor her life was a big party , with no beginning and no end . \nthis behavior has of course estranged her from her only sister and from life itself . \nher existence is filled with endless parties and comic episodes . \nsuch as when she got drunk with boyfriend jasper ( dominic west ) , borrowed her sister's ( elizabeth perkins ) wedding limo and crashed it into someone's house . \nthis time she had to pay with a 28 day stay in court-ordered rehab . \nhere she must realize that the only thing that can save her is her is redemption , willpower and commitment . \nmost important she must realize her place and direction in life and understand that her life is not just a big party . \nthe film itself feels like a rehab program , whining and moaning about things that have been said and written a million times . \nit is a classic cautionary tale . \nan echo . \na big , fat and expensive clich ? . \na shadow of last year's 'girl , interrupted' , which likewise followed in the footsteps of great masterpieces like 'the cuckoo's nest' and 'trainspotting' . \ndirector betty thomas has stuffed her film with so many failures and errors , that it is impossible to sum them all up in one review . \nfor some paranoid reason she decided to make her film a drama/comedy . \njokes and funny characters almost deliberately delude you from the really important and complex issues : alienation , despair , terror , confusion , loneliness . \nand what awesome power and strength of character it actually takes to overcome all that and become clean . \nisn't that what the filmmakers wanted to show in the first place ? \neven the transition process itself seems like a walk in the park . betty thomas' idea of hell is a cozy , homey place where happy alcoholics and cheerful drug addicts are not allowed to smoke , drink or watch tv after 11 . \nit is simply too light , simplified and unnecessary sweet to be taken seriously . \nbut the worst thing about it is that it actually thinks that it is saying something of significance . \nthat it actually tries to educate the audience with its extremely predictable and primitive story . \n \" all you need to do is just say no \" , says dr . cornell ( steve buscemi ) as if was the revelation of the century . \nand that's how simple it is ! \nin fact i would rather watch 'lost in space' once again , than return to '28 days' . \nas for acting , it's acceptable , but hardly anything else . \nfor sandra bullock it's an opportunity to demonstrate that she is capable of more than 'speed' . \nshe handles her part with a surprising professionalism and ease that certainly saves the film from being a complete flop . \ndominic west shines as the source of gwenie's devilish temptations , but elizabeth perkins' and steve buscemi's great talents are wasted on unnoticeable and shallow characters . \nalthough intellectually 'girl , interrupted' was a greater achievement , '28 days' is superior in its visual aspect . \nthere are some nice flash back sequences and occasionally impressive pacing , but the overall technical aspect of this film is on the ground floor . \nthe most important thing is that we've seen it before and it was a lot better . \n'clean and sober' , 'only when i laugh' , 'when a man loves a woman' , 'leaving las vegas' and many other stronger films were made about the same issues . \nso what's the point ? \nin other words '28 days' doesn't contribute to the moviemaking business on any level . \nif you're caught in a snowstorm or bolts of lightning fall from the sky and you're standing in front of the movie theatre , you might as well go in and watch '28 days' . \nunder all other circumstances stay away , because this film equals $8 and 103 minutes lost . \n", "capsule : combine one quart of raiders of the lost ark , a dash of a jackie chan movie ( sans jackie ) , two teaspoons of gun- and swordplay , and a dollop of cgi . \nsimmer for 100 minutes . \nyields : zilch . \nthe phantom is a depressing and tired retread of so many earlier , better movies that after the fifteen-minute mark i started cataloguing them out loud . \nit's hard to make a good action-adventure movie that doesn't simply recycle its predecessors , and i've seen movies that even at least did the recycling gracefully . \nthe phantom , allegedly based on the long-running comic of the same name , doesn't even bother to be graceful . \nit's a stupid and incompetent movie in too many ways to list , but i'll try . \nthe film opens up with a \" prelude \" sequence that looks like it was slashed to ribbons in the editing and then given a heavy voice-over to compensate for whatever got thrown out . \nwe go from there to a jungle sequence that , i swear to god , recycles the truck-chase scene from raiders of the lost ark note-for-note , possibly even shot-for-shot , right down to the moment where indy wrenched open the door and slung one of the drivers out into the brush -- and then goes on to rip off the rope-bridge scene from \" sorcerer \" as well ! \nsorcerer , as you may well remember , was a remake of a french movie , the wages of fear , in which a bunch of lowlifes were paid piles of money to drive a truck loaded with nitro through horrible jungle terrain . \nboth versions of that movie were far more interesting than this flick , but i've got my job to do , so back to the salt mines we go . \nanyway , the cinematic theft doesn't stop there . \nor at least the lack of inspiration . \nthere isn't a single thing here we haven't seen , and it's not given to us in a way that remotely evokes our interest . \nwe have ( where's my list ? ) \na bad girl , a tough good girl , a secret cave hideaway ( which seems inspired more by dr . \nno than anything else ) , a boardroom meeting that drips with greed and venality , magical artifacts of terrible power , and cary-hiroyuki tagawa wasted in another stupid role where he gets to wear a fu manchu mustache and sneer a lot and generally humiliate himself . \nwhat else is there ? \nthe plot is a waste of time . \nthe sets alternate between big but hokey -- and tiny and still hokey . \nthere are lines in the script that are just begging to be mst3ked -- and i'm sure once mike and the 'bots get the cash , they'll stick it on their sked . \nthe only thing in the movie worth noting is billy zane -- he's a good actor , and he tries very hard , even when the script is sending him down one dead alley of a scene after another . \nall i can say is that i pray this isn't the beginning of the end for him -- although it sure looks like the final nail in the coffin for the comic-book super-hero movie . \n", "a new entry in the \" revisionist history \" genre of filmmaking , dick suggests that two not-too-bright teenage girls are the cause of the uncovering of the nation's biggest presidential scandal . \nkirsten dunst and michelle williams star betsy and arlene , who while trying to deliver a fan letter from arlene's watergate hotel room , accidentally stumble across g . gordon liddy ( played dead-on by harry shearer ) and the infamous break-in . \nwhen they recognize liddy later on during a white house field trip , they are ushered into a conference room , questioned as to what they know , and leave as official presidential dog walkers . \nthe girls manage to unwittingly uncover every bit of the watergate scandal while performing their duties , but have no clue as to what they are getting involved with . \nwhen they discover that nixon ( another dead-on performance by dan hedaya , who actually favors nixon slightly , unlike anthony hopkins ) has been abusive to checkers , the presidential dog , thanks to the conversations that he always recorded , they quit and become disillusioned . \nduring a prank phone call the girls make to woodward and bernstein , events are set into motion that eventually lead to the president's resignation . \nthis film starts off promisingly with an aged woodward and bernstein arguing with each other on an obvious larry king-type talk show ( featuring a cameo by french stewart ) about revealing the identity of \" deep throat \" . \nfrom there , we are subjected to bodily function humor and just about every bad \" dick \" joke one can derive from this type of supposed comedy . \nat one point , the girls are having to scream over a high school band playing on the steps of the lincoln memorial . \nthe band manages to stop right as dunst screams \" you have to stop letting dick run your life ! \" \nmuch to the horror of everyone standing within earshot . \nseveral other variations on this wordplay surface all throughout the film . \nif this movie had been smarter i would have been less likely to fault it's juvenile bathroom humor , but it's not . \nthe film was apparently made for relatively younger people because every major player in the watergate scandal is introduced and shoved down the audience's throat in the least subtle way possible . \ni don't recall oliver stone's nixon having to pander to it's audience , but of course that film wasn't a comedy aimed squarely at a 13-20 year-old film going audience . \nthe only redeeming thing about this movie is it's remarkable supporting cast . \ni wanted to see more of ferrell and mcculloch's woodward and bernstein . \nthose two characters are the sole basis for my rating . \ni wish they had been given more screen time , but unfortunately , they are only relegated to the final half-hour . \ntheir constant bickering and fighting over trying to get the story are a major highlight , especially mcculloch's constant thwarting of ferrell's attempts to gather information from the girls ( who , in the course of the narrative are revealed as deep throat , so named thanks to an ill planned trip to a porno theater by betsy's brother ) . \nthe other members of the cast are excellent in their portrayals of their particular characters , but are given nothing to work with . \ni'd like to see the same cast portray these characters in a script more suited towards their comedic abilities . \nas for the two leads , dunst and williams can definitely do better . \nthey come off as what could best be described as romy and michele : the early years in this particular film , a highly dubious distinction at best . \nstay through the first half of the end credits though , to see an interesting scene involving dunst and williams suggestively sucking on lollipops emblazoned with the title of the movie . \nan excellent idea marred by poor execution , dick could have been a great movie . \nless of the juvenile humor and more of the smarter comedy displayed by the woodward and bernstein scenes , could have made this film a wonderful satire of the nixon presidency as seen through the eyes of two naive fifteen year olds . \nas it stands though , dick offers nothing but what filmmaker kevin smith so accurately defines as \" dick and poopie \" jokes . \nand that , to me , does not make a funny movie . \n[pg-13] \n", "words i thought i'd never write : the sequel to urban legend lacks the grace , wit , and power of the original . \nput the gun to my head , pull the trigger , and put me out of my misery . \nbetter yet , put the horror genre out of its misery . \nwhen you've finished watching urban legends : final cut , you'll share my same grim point of view thanks to the horrible acting , terrible script , and ridiculous directing which has become all too common today . \nurban legends : final cut is a smorgasbord of stolen movie ideas ( mainly from the blair witch project and scream ) : fabulous people with perfect teeth and skin , one creepy film school , and a dog eating a freshly removed kidney from one of the movie's hapless victims . \nurban legends delivers a story about a bunch of film students working on their thesis films to win the coveted \" hitchcock award \" which guarantees the winner a director deal in hollywood . \none female filmmaker ( jennifer morrison , the freaky dead girl from stir of echoes ) writes a fiction script based on a serial killer who kills his victims according to \" urban legend \" tales . \nsuddenly , her entire crew starts getting bumped off with urban-legendary homicides , but the bodies are always missing and she is often the only witness to the killings . \nthe killer wears a fencing mask and a long black overcoat , looking like a scorned olympian out to avenge his defeat in sydney . \nwhy this is scary is never explained . \nof course , the golden rule of sequels is that there must be least one recurring character for continuity's sake . \nurban legends has one minor , recurring character from the original who we never cared about anyway ( the security guard , of all people ) . \nthe other central problem is that this character has already seen the urban legend killings once before , but she's utterly clueless about what's going on around her . \ncall it suspension of disbelief . \nthis film is also a prime example of how horror films are now completely dead in the water . \nthe last decent horror film was the blair witch project , and that seemed more like a snuff film than fiction . \nthe stalking killer with crazy motivation has become a tired clich ? , as everyone seems to have forgotten : real horror is not about what is seen but about what is unknown . \n", "godzilla is the ultimate culmination of the \" who cares about plot \" summer movie . \na loose remake of the 1954 \" classic \" japanese monster movie , godzilla , king of the monsters ( which is itself pretty thin in the story department ) , roland emmerich and dean devlin's big-budget lizard-stomps-manhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain dead in mind . \nthe script isn't just \" dumbed down , \" it's lobotomized . \ngodzilla lives and dies on special effects alone . \npresumably , the primary target group for this film is teenage boys , the demographic most likely to shell out $7 repeatedly to see the same images of monster-instigated carnage . \nthat's not to say that females and other age groups are immune to the special effects seduction ; they're just not as readily susceptible . \nthis is the third straight movie in a row where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of computer-generated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability to write and direct for actors . \nstargate was a financial success . \nindependence day was a runaway hit . \nand , with godzilla already drowning in hype and merchandising tie-ins before it even opens , it's virtually guaranteed at least $100 million . \nnice numbers for a film that could have been penned by a not-too-precocious grade school kid . \ngodzilla isn't completely without merit , although it is close . \nthere's a certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan , but it wears off quickly . \nfrankly , while the special effects are competent , they're not all that stunning . \nthere's nothing new here ; it's jurassic park meets aliens , with a little independence day thrown in for bad measure . \nmaybe it will require george lucas and his new star wars movie to take computer-generated visuals to the next level . \ngodzilla never really pushes the envelope , preferring to remain within a comfort zone . \nthe imagination of monster movies like king kong has been replaced by a crass , formulaic approach which disallows creativity . \n ( how disturbing is it to know that godzilla has been chosen to close the 51st cannes film festival ? ) \nworst of all , godzilla isn't even exciting . \nwith the possible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end , there isn't a sequence in this film that raises the pulse . \neven the scenes with dozens of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension and suspense that they are yawn-provoking . \nindependence day may have been dumb , but it was full of \" adrenaline moments \" capable of getting the audience involved in the action . \nin this aspect of its production , as in so many others , godzilla is lacking . \nactually , part of the problem is that we're never sure who we're supposed to be rooting for : the green monster with an attitude or the paper-thin humans trying to stop him . \nthe plot , such as it is , can be summed up rather simply . \nafter sinking a few ships and leaving some footprints on tropical islands , godzilla shows up in the big apple . \nhe does some of the usual tourist things : stops by madison square garden , visits the chrysler building , goes on a walk through central park , and takes the subway . \nin the process , he knocks over a few buildings and steps on countless cabs , but he never has trouble with traffic jams . \non hand to stop him is an elite u . s . army unit , led by a slightly less-arrogant-than-usual military man ( kevin dunn ) and a biologist named nick tatopoulos , who has a theory about godzilla . \nin his opinion , the big guy is actually a lizard grown to enormous proportions as a result of the radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific . \nin nick's words , godzilla is \" a mutated aberration ? an incipient creature ? the first of its kind . \" \nas luck would have it , nick's old girlfriend , audrey ( maria pitillo ) , is a reporter based at a new york tv station . \nalong with her cameraman friend , animal ( hank azaria ) , she decides to follow nick around as he trails godzilla . \nthen , just when the military has rejected nick's theory about why godzilla is in new york , a member of the french secret service ( jean reno ) recruits him for a special assignment . \ninstead of stomping around tokyo this time , godzilla has chosen new york city . \nunfortunately , manhattan has been destroyed so many times in recent disaster movies ( independence day , deep impact , armageddon ) that it's becoming boring . \nthe whole tradition of monsters roaming around the city started with king kong , but the big ape was only about 30 feet tall . \nhe could climb the empire state building . \nat ten times that height , godzilla would be more likely to knock it over . \ngodzilla contains a few lame attempts at humor . \nthere's an ongoing feud between animal and his wife that plays like sit-com material , an unfunny and repetitive gag about how no one can pronounce nick's last name properly , and a rather tame attack on film critics roger ebert and gene siskel . \nboth of the popular personalities have alter egos in the film : \" ebert , \" the mayor of new york , is played by michael lerner , and \" gene \" ( lorry goldman ) is his campaign manager . \nebert's re-election slogan is , not surprisingly , \" thumbs up for new york . \" \nthe siskel/ebert stuff is amusing the first time it's used , but , after a while , it grows tiresome . \nand , although the \" characters \" don't serve any real purpose , they keep popping up . \ngodzilla is saddled with an unimpressive cast . \nthis is largely because emmerich doesn't want to risk a human performance upstaging his lizard . \nthat's not to say that matthew broderick and jean reno aren't capable of good performances ( both have done their share of solid acting in the past ) , but they aren't a-list names . \nthen again , considering the quality of the writing , even pacino and deniro would have been hard- pressed to shine . \nmaria pitillo ( dear god ) plays the love interest and hank azaria ( great expectations ) is on hand to present what is supposed to be comic relief . \nultimately , it doesn't really matter what i ( or any other critic , for that matter ) have to say about the movie . \ntristar has assumed that godzilla , like all self-proclaimed summer event motion pictures , is pretty much critic-proof . \nit may also be word-of-mouth-proof . \nthose who want to see the movie will see it no matter what i write or their friends say . \nso , when i go on record to assert that godzilla is one of the most idiotic blockbuster movies of all time , it's like spitting into the wind . \nemmerich and devlin are master illusionists , waving their wands and mesmerizing audiences with their smoke and mirrors . \nit's probably too much to hope that some day , movie-goers will wake up and realize that they've been had . \n", "recently one night a young director named baz luhrmann couldn't sleep . \nhe tumbled out of bed and moved over to the television where he watched mtv for an hour . \nthen he moved to his kitchen

a couple of new dinos ( a spinosauraus , which goes head to head with the t-rex , and pteranodons ) . \nthe plot , as it were , is a series of coincidences combined with extreme leaps of faith and a trifecta of stupid cell phone tricks . \nthe effects are no longer new , and , as shot by television cinematographer shelly johnson , rather murky looking at times . \nfilm editing by robert dalva ( \" october sky \" ) was presumably done by machete , to keep this down to a 90 minute run time . \ni know of no other reason to explain the ridiculous ending which features the survivors confronting a pack of raptors , then being saved by the most ludicrous of logic jumps within a few minutes . \n'original' music by don davis just repeats john williams' original themes . \nwhile neill and young morgan attempt to inject some humor and humanity into the proceedings , the rest of the cast are plodding unexceptional . \n \" jurassic park iii \" will probably provide some quick entertainment for those who go into it knowing what to expect , the same crowd who maybe liked \" the lost world : jurassic park . \" \n", "barb wire , pamela anderson lee's first foray into films , highlights the fact that her only talent lies in her silicone enhanced assets . \nbeing the only notable member of the cast , the camera lingers lustily o n her body at every opportunity , making her character's catch line , \" don't call me babe , \" sound very ironic indeed . \nfrom the very opening of the movie , we are treated to a striptease routine from anderson , ending in her hurling her stiletto smack between the eyes of a lusty male who happened to call her babe . \nthroughout the movie , there is ample footage of enormous breasts and cleavage , if not of anderson's , then at least of the female extras . \nthis alone is enough to retitle the movie babe wire . \nfor a plot , barb wire rehashes the casablanca storyline . \nit is 2017 , the middle of the second american civil war , and barb wire , a former resistance fighter , runs a joint in steel harbour called hammerhead ( ! ! ) . \nknown for attracting resistance fighters an d characters of all sorts , the bar attracts the attention of

to the airport on the other side of the town , past the government-controlled areas , and to freedom . \neven the airport looks like the one in casablanca , except that the plane in the background is a modern , private jet . \nthere are hardly any significant moments in this film , and one gets the impression that it was designed for young teenagers familiar with the dark horse comics version of \" barb wire . \" \nif anything , one leaves the film with the confirmation that anderson di d not do her own stunts . \nwho could fight and jump in a skimpy , strapless leather top , and yet keep her breasts from spilling out ? \nonly a stuntwoman . \nnot pamela anderson lee . \n", "humanities quest for knowledge never ends . \nso a team of scientists and film-makers travel to the amazon to search

turns out to be a snake hunter without scruples who only wants to catch a giant anaconda and sell it to a zoo . \nwe don't have to wait too long for the giant snake . \nshe just had a panther hors

viewer although not the way the makers of the movie had planned . \nhowever the scenes without the anaconda are rather boring . \nwhenever the leading lady shows up we're in for a laugh . \nthe snake reminds us of a favorite character of a famous animated movie even if she should be an awe-inspiring monster . \nher attacks always follow the same plan : one last hypnotic look - she's looking at you , kid - then she speedily wraps herself around her victim and starts to gush it down . \nmostly we don't see the act of devouring . \nbut she looks nice when she wiggles away with her bulging middle part . \nwhoever did the special effects on this movie may have wanted to go to a zoo first and study some real snakes . \nmaybe then the anaconda model would have looked more real . \nthe animatronics are somewhat more believable . \nbut that didn't work for the strangling scenes . \ndon't go see the movie for the f/x . \nthey are everything but up-to-date . \nthe viewer who likes to watch the end credits will see to his/her surprise that a snake expert was a consultant for the team . \nwe may doubt though that he has ever seen the final result of his work . \na well known american science magazine is also mentioned in the credits , but i will refrain from naming it here to avoid further damage to its reputation . \nthe majority of viewer will have left the theater as

"absolute power , the new film produced and directed by clint eastwood , attempts to be a thriller set in the world of hypocritical presidents and their murderous political staff . \nit is about as thrilling as a lecture on the mating habits of the south american grasshopper . \none can only wonder how an utterly absurd script like the one written by william goldman could have ever interested eastwood . \nnot only is the plot unbelievable and contrived , but even the writing itself lacks any consistency or intelligence . \ncontinually underestimating the audience , the film gives us information we already know or dont even need . \ndetails essential to the story are so improbably convenient they are annoying ( like why would two unprepared secret service men carry two night-vision goggles in their car ? ) . \noddly enough , the initial setup for absolute power offers interesting possibilities . \na masterful jewel-thief ( played by clint eastwood ) witnesses the murder of the wife of a powerful millionaire ( played by e . g . \nmarshall ) . \nwhile robbing one of marshalls mansions , he is forced to hide in the bedrooms vault . \nthere , through a two-way mirror , he sees the wife and another man engage in passionate foreplay . \ntheir game of love quickly turns into a violent struggle as the man starts beating the woman . \nin self defense , the woman grabs a letter-opener and stabs the man in the elbow . \nshe raises her arm to stab again when she is fatally shot by two secret service men . \nthe man ? \nhe is the president of the united states of america . \nwhere does the film go wrong ? \nit cannot be the acting . \nclint eastwood , ed harris and gene hackman as the president give type-cast , but decent performances . \nthe cinematography is sufficient ; wild and erratic during action sequences , dark and mysterious during psychologically suspenseful scenes , and calm and warm during dramatic dialogue . \neven the music is not as bombastic as it usually tends to be in the thriller/suspense genre . \nthe fault clearly lies in the screenplay , and the screenplay alone . \nwhile setting up a story about misuse of power , about the true possessors of that power , and about intrigue and double-crossing , it does not resolve it . \nnot one buildup of suspense is resolved by an exciting climax . \nrather , the tense situations are left dangling at the end , giving the viewer an uneasy sense of incompleteness . \nan example of this is a very promising and tense buildup of a scene : in an attempt to arrest clint eastwood , the police have set up a trap at a small restaurant . \npolice officers are everywhere , incognito of course . \nat the same time , not one but two hit men are preparing to kill clint eastwood when he arrives . \nall three parties are unaware of each others presence . \nthis scene is tremendously exciting and the audience is wondering how clint eastwood , who might suspect this is a trap , will get himself out of this difficult position . \nhe will probably have a brilliant plan , involving ingenious preparations . \nhowever , when he arrives at the trap , both hit men miss ( how convenient ) and in the confusion eastwood simply walks away . \nthe buildup of this scene took about ten minutes . \nten minutes of close ups of the hit men loading their weapons intercut with the police preparing for the trap . \nthe scene was resolved in less than 20 seconds . . . \nparallel to the story line of catching the real killer is a cliche emotional tale about the estranged relationship between father eastwood and his daughter . \nthe daughter blames her father for never being there for her , because he was either in jail or robbing a house somewhere . \nof course their relationship takes a turn for the better during the adventure and they end up a happy family . \nagain , it is commendable that absolute power tries to deviate from the mainstream suspense film by giving room for a dramatic subplot . \nhowever , trying is simply not enough ! \nthe second story line should be subtle , original and preferably unpredictable . . . \neverything this film is not . \nhow could a screenplay like absolute power ever get the funding to be produced ? \nhow could eastwood , who has successfully produced and directed many outstanding films such as the brilliant unforgiven , ever believe in a project like this one ? \ni am sad to say that my respect for the actor/director/producer has diminished substantially due to this film . \ndirector quentin tarantino once said : \" i can make a good movie out of any bad script . \" \ndirector clint eastwood obviously cannot . \n", "ever feel you're spending your whole life on the net ( ouch ! ) , eating , breathing and excreting web

phone why they all couldn't make it for a party - nobody is going to be meeting anybody in this film , they would rather be talking on the phone . \nhere's salwen's plot : while all the characters are

animatedly into another friend's answering machine . \n ( as gale's overly-chatty aunt recounts , her cordless was knicked into her ear and lodged in her brain . ) \nbut these moments are not enough to sustain the movie . \nthe pace sags , the dialogue drags and not much acting appears to be required of the telephone-touters . \nand the ending is literally a non-event as expected , everyone is too chicken to turn up for the party frank throws in gale's memory despite promising over the phone that they will . \nwe get the point . \nthe movie appears to be intent on flogging its terribly-'90s

you get to know them , who would want friends like griffin and mona ? \nthe supporting cast is given nothing to do and , sometimes , does harm to the film , given the material they are forced to use . \nnastassja kinski plays a cellist with whom porter has a fling . \nthe actress , who has , eerily , failed to age over the years , is miscast as the air-headed musician and the character doesn't

of 1970's irwin allen disaster movies , the poseidon adventure features an all-star cast including gene hackman and ernest borgnine spouting some of the most laughable dramatic dialogue in movie history while trapped on a cruise ship . \nthe story begins on the u . s . s . \nposeidon's big new year's cruise , where we are introduced to the ensemble of people who will soon be the only passengers left alive . \nlet's see , there's the new age preacher ( hackman ) who advises people to \" pray to that part of god within yourself . \" \nthere's the ex-cop ( borgnine ) who busted a hooker ( stella stevens ) six times -- then married her . \nthere's the hippie singer ( \" there's got to be a morning after . . . \" ) who turns to the company of a lonely man ( red buttons ) once her brother is killed . \nand to round out the group : the elderly couple ( jack albertson and shelley winters ) who live aboard the ship , the beautiful teenage girl and her brother who are sailing alone and adventurous scotsman roddy mcdowall . \nwe get to know these people a little too well in the first thirty minutes of the poseidon adventure , before straight- faced ship captain leslie nielson looks in horror at the giant tidal wave headed right for the ship . \neveryone's in the giant ballroom at the time , shortly past midnight of the new year , when the ship turns first on its side , then completely upside down . \nthe second- in-command wants everyone to wait in the ballroom until help arrives , but rebel hackman leads his small band of followers on a quest to the top of the ship . \nin this case , because the ship is overturned , the top is the bottom . \nor is the bottom the top ? \neither way , we get to see a lot of bottoms because the two beautiful women in the crew are both conveniently wearing hot pants during the scenes where the camera shoots upwards while they climb up ladders and -- in the ballroom scene -- christmas trees . \nthus begins an hour or more of hushed trips down long corridors , through burning rooms , etc . while the ship slowly fills with water behind them . \nit's a race against the clock which is only mildly interesting . \nthe poseidon adventure works more as a bad movie to laugh at , with all the melodrama that comes in-between the non-thrilling action scenes . \nthe one note in borgnine's one-note performance is to be a cranky old man that argues with hackman every step of the way while buttons and the hippie fall in love ( although since there isn't a sex scene , we never find out if his buttons really are red ) and albertson and winters wonder if they'll live to see their grandson's birth . \nshelley winters provides the most hilarious scene in the movie in a scene toward the end , where water has flooded the next two rooms of the ship and hackman is preparing to dive under with a rope for the rest of them to pull along . \nwinters , who has been the whiny fat woman throughout the movie ( stevens even not-so- affectionately calls her \" fatass \" in one scene ) , finally finds her purpose . \n \" i was the underwater swimming champ of new york three years running when i was seventeen , \" she brags , and before hackman can even ask her how she could be seventeen for three years , she's swimming through the water , her skirt billowing up around her hips , showing off her cellulite ( or do you call it shellulite ? ) \nridden thighs . \nit's not so much funny as innately disgusting , which pretty much sums up the poseidon adventure as a whole . \n", "while watching loser , it occurred to me that amy heckerling's true genius as a film-maker is casting . \nin fast times at ridgemont high , she gave us sean penn's jeff spicoli ; in look who's talking , she turned bruce willis into a wise-cracking baby and provided john travolta with is first career revival ; in clueless , she found a star vehicle for the adorableness that is ( or was ) alicia silverstone . \nshe seems to understand instinctively how to find performers the audience will like in spite of their flaws . \nunfortunately , she may also be starting to understand that she understands . \ngiving appealing actors an appealing script creates likeable movies . \ngiving appealing actors a script in which their appeal _is_ the movie makes for unexpectedly awful films like loser . \nnaturally , heckerling makes her protagonist an all-around swell guy . \npaul tannek ( jason biggs ) is a small-town boy who gets a scholarship to nyu , then instantly finds himself an island of compassion and diligence in the cold-hearted big city . \npaul is the kind of guy who gives up his seat on the subway to an elderly woman ; his roommates adam ( zak orth ) , chris ( tom sadoski ) and noah ( jimmi simpson ) are the kind of guys who blast their music and let their waterbeds leak all over paul . \npaul is also the kind of guy who adores girls from afar , in this case the lovely dora diamond ( mena suvari ) . \ndora has problems of her own , including a shortage of funds to pay her tuition and a relationship with a professor , edward alcott ( greg kinnear ) , that's more than slightly one-sided . \nthey're two conscientious kids who love animals and homeless people , so clearly they belong together , even if paul is a loser . \ni must confess that , for a while , i was suckered in by heckerling's casting . \njason biggs is an engaging performer whose unconventional looks make him even easier to embrace ; suvari is a coquette with an undercurrent of intelligence . \nthey're pleasant enough to watch , and heckerling gives us plenty of scenes establishing how nice they are and how nice their respective antagonists aren't . \nthen it gradually becomes clear that there's virtually nothing to loser but scenes of that sort . \nin theory , loser is a romantic comedy , but there is scarcely a laugh to be found in the entire film ( notable exception : a cameo by a scene-stealing comic actor as a video store clerk ) . \ninstead of taking any time to make the characters' situations funny , heckerling spends 98 minutes making her characters' situations pathetic . \nshe shows none of the ear for quirky dialogue that sparked clueless , nor any of that film's interest in lively plotting ( not surprisingly , since clueless's plot came via jane austen's emma ) . \nshe simply turns the film into a pity party . \nsince loser is a film composed almost entirely of establishing character , you might think that those characters would be interesting , or at least slightly complicated . \ninstead , you have people either so perfect or so unredeemable that there's no reason to watch them . \npaul isn't just a nice guy , he's flawless ; consequently , he's a central character who does absolutely no growing . \nhis roommates aren't just inconsiderate , they're actively evil-blackmailing professor alcott , drugging women with rohypnol and generally giving humanity a bad name . \nand professor alcott isn't just manipulative , he turns dora into his house slave . \ndora's unthinking devotion to alcott is the only whiff of basic human frailty to be found in loser , and even that isn't explored in sufficient detail . \nthere's more ambiguity in the 30-second snippet from alan cumming's broadway performance as the emcee in cabaret then there is in the rest of loser it's one thing to turn supporting characters into comic exaggerations ; it's another to flatten your leads into easily digestible mush . \nand it would help if those comic exaggerations were somehow . . . \ni don't know . . . \ncomic . \nstill , i spent much of the film holding out the ridiculous hope that heckerling would somehow salvage loser from its tedium and justify my desire to like paul and dora . \nthat hope dissolved the moment heckerling underscored a sequence of paul in the throes of unrequited love to simon and garfunkel's \" scarborough fair/canticle . \" \ninstead of giving the sequence a knowing wink-a reference to the graduate , a hint that paul is becoming an overly-sensitive clich-heckerling plays it deadly straight . \neven in the scenes that scream for a light comic touch and a bit of a poke at her protagonist's foibles , she finds it impossible to stray from the gospel of paul as saint . \nclueless's cher had her self-absorption and manipulative tendencies to balance her cuteness . \nin loser , amy heckerling shows a leaden hand with material that demands friskiness ( her one show of wit involves naming paul's dorm \" hunt's hall \" after erstwhile bowery boy huntz hall ) . \nher gift with casting proved to be her curse . \nloser may be a crashing bore , but gee , aren't those two kids swell ? \n", "capsule : john the baptist is sent from heaven to see is the

his career takes a nosedive to hell with his \" role \" as john brown , a depressed security guard with a big heart who hopes that one day he can become a real policemen and help the people around him . \nhe dreams of heroic deeds and the subsequent admiration of his long time crush , dr . brenda bradford ( joely fisher ) . \nbut after a few bizarre coincidences it seems that he has to dream no longer . \njohn breaks every bone in his body while trying to save dr . brenda's father . \ndr . brenda has been working on a \" gadget project , \" which would make a half-man half-machine super-policeman to fight crime . \nfeeling indebted to john she decides to save his life by making him the subject , realizing his dream of becoming a policeman . \nnow , when he says \" go go gadget [insert name of gizmo here] \" he can use all kinds of nifty gadgets to capture crooks , bang up bandits and mangle murderers . \nin the meantime , the evil claw ( rupert everett ) , the man responsible for the murder of the good doctor's father is building a gadget of his own : a carbon copy of our inspector gadget except evil and john brown's worst nemesis . \nclaw has plans of world domination , which leaves it up to the inspector and his gadget mobile ( voice of d . l . \nhughley ) to save humanity from his wrath . \nstate of the art effects fly at a mad pace in this $90 million dollar movie and yet director david kelogg never sets up a convincing atmosphere . \nhad they replaced all the fancy gizmos with dollar bills they would have wound up with the same effect . \nwhat we see on the screen is like the raw ingredients of a meal : all of the expensive f/x amounts to nothing . \npart of the charm of the tv series was its sly irreverence which has gone down the toilet in the condescending movie . \ncan kids really admire a hero so goody-two-shoes that he screams \" hey ! \nyou ran a stop sign ! \" \nwhile hanging off the back bumper of a quickly moving vehicle ? \ni think that today's children will respond better to somebody dashing , someone ultra-cool . \nthey ( probably ) receive enough preaching from their parents and its an insult to their intelligence to assume that they want to go to an action movie to see a father figure kick butt . \nin addition to the more complex complaints above , there's also the simple stuff : inspector gadget is boring , formulaic and achingly implausible . \nthere's no feeling that the director really cares about his story : more than any other film i've seen this year , this one really feels like it was made on an assembly line . \nthere's a popular commercial ( for sprite , but that's irrelevant ) running in movie theaters before features that spoofs the way major studios deal with projects . \nit consists of studio suits discussing a fictitious ( thank god ) movie called \" death slug \" . \neach executive gleefully presents a different merchandise tie-in ( slug taco ! \nslug on a stick ! ) . \nat the end one of them asks \" what about the movie ? \" \nanother answers : \" well , we don't have a script yet , but we can bang one out by friday . \" \nthey probably could have replaced \" death slug \" with inspector gadget . \nthis film contains the sort of logical contradictions and blatantly obvious adherence to formula that could have been eliminated had any attention been payed to the script . \nit's no coincidence that most good children's entertainment these days comes from animation . \nanimated features take so long to maker that it becomes a labor of love for the filmmakers and they put care and pride into their work . \nthese kinds of films are banged out quicker and a good percentage turn out worthless , sloppy and impersonal . \nthe studios are becoming factories and films their assembled products . \n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \n", "as the twin surfer dudes , stew and phil deedle , lay bandaged and unconscious in the hospital , phil comes to first and chooses the coolest way to wake his brother . \nyanking out his iv , he uses it like a water pistol to soak his brother's face . \nthis bit of lame physical humor is typical of disney's meet the deedles , a movie more to be endured that watched . \n ( i stopped looking at my wife during the screening , since every time i did , she'd start sticking her finger in her throat . \nand she's right , it is that bad . ) \ndirected without any imagination by steve boyum , whose long background in film is mainly in stunts and in second unit direction , the film limps along at best . \nboyum attempts to keep the pace moving by staging stunts , stunts and more stunts . \namazingly for someone with his background , he seems incapable of finding any fresh ones , and we have a car go off the road five different times -- maybe more . \nbut who's counting ? \nand then there is the script by james herzfeld , whose only other film , tapeheads from a decade ago , was so awful that it is considered a cult classic . \nmeet the deedles , however , is painfully bad rather than laughably bad . \nit will probably be in and out of the theaters like a tornado and is in no danger of becoming a classic anything . \nherzfeld treats us to gratingly abysmal dialog that includes \" your geyser's a geezer , \" and \" i'd like to put a deedle in her haystack . \" \nas the movie opens , the twins , who at one point describe themselves modestly as \" a walking kodak moment , \" are celebrating their 18th birthday . \nas they ride a parasail high above the waters of waikiki , a truant officer pursues them on his jet ski . \nas heirs to the fabulous fortune of the deedle empire , the boys are sent by their father to camp broken spirit at yellowstone to transform the two laid-back beach bums into men . \nas they arrive in their wetsuits in yellowstone , they've got their surfboards , skateboards , and a hawaiian drink machine the size of an armoire . \ntheir camp has gone out of business , but they are mistaken for new park rangers . \nthe rest of the movie has them fighting the park's overpopulation of prairie dogs as well as a deranged ex-ranger , played by dennis hopper , who is out to stop old faithful before its billionth birthday celebration , scheduled for later in the week . \nhopper , who has made some wonderful movies , carried away being a recent favorite , does have a propensity for choosing some truly odoriferous material . \nthis isn't his worst acting , but meet the deedles is arguably the worst movie he's ever been in . \nsteve van wormer and paul walker , as stew and phil , give lifeless performances . \nthe only actor in the movie with any demonstrable talent is a cute little prairie dog named petey . \neven the cinematography by david hennings is so prosaic that it manages to make yellowstone look dull . \nto add insult to injury , hennings is fond of inappropriate close-ups , which only serve to remind us of the inanity of the dialog . \nput a ten-foot pair of lips on the screen , and you naturally pay extra attention to what is said . \nalthough boyum says in the notes that he is proud that his film is appropriate for families , one wonders how many skateboarders will attempt the movie's stunt of lying on your back on a skateboard while negotiating a busy and twisting mountain road . \nthey make it look like so much fun that i'm sure many will try some variation of the stunt . \n \" how could this possibly be worst , \" asks phil . \njust when you suspect it can't , the movie takes a turn further downhill . \nits low point may have you

finally meet in a kiss . \nas they pull back , their faces are full of the dirt that encased the worm they have just ingested . \nmeet the deedles runs about an hour and a half . \nit is rated pg for a little bathroom humor and would be acceptable for kids around 6 and up . \nmy son jeffrey and his friend nickolas , both almost 9 , gave the show * * * . \nthey both thought the scenes with petey were among their favorites . \nnickolas also mentioned the scene in which the circus bear drives a jeep , and jeffrey especially liked the one in which the circus elephant was referred to as dumbo . \n", "'bicentennial man' is a family film without any external motive with the exception of providing the minimum dose of entertainment . \nchris columbus , the director who gave you \" mrs . doubtfire \" , plays on sentimental strings and mushy dialogue to make his point . \nbased on the short story by isaac asimov , it is supposed to be a science fiction story about a robot who wants to be human , which as you can imagine is very difficult . \nstarting in a not too distant future the film concentrates on a wealthy family that buys an android to help them with the house and children . \nsoon this robot , called andrew ( robin williams ) shows abilities that makes his owner mr . martin ( sam neill ) very curious . \nandrew is interested in art and music , he \" enjoys \" making clocks , which clearly shows that he has genuine emotions . \nit shows out that because of a small failure in the \" electrical circuits \" and \" positronic brain \" andrew has accidentally gained a soul . \nthis makes him unique and his evil creators worried . \nthen mr . martin decides to teach andrew all the things he wasn't programmed to do . \nsoon andrew wants to leave the house in pursuit of freedom , destiny and love . \nthis film can be described as a disney version of blade runner , a film that still shines as the biggest gem in the crown of science fiction . \never since that film , the subject of humanity still stands as one big controversy . \nwhat makes us human ? \nthe thoughts ? \nthe emotions ? \nis it possible to become human ? \nat what point can we say to a robot \" now you are one of us \" ? \nthese are very tough questions that require a serious and thurral approach . \nit is obvious that columbus didn't take them very seriously . \nwhen you think about it , this film is not really meditating on the question \" when is a robot no longer a machine , but a human being ? \" , but tells a story about racial discrimination and lack of understanding . \nandrew is so complex and emotional from the very beginning that the audience immediately accepts him as a human being , and only the society has troubles with it . \nin other words , it is as far from reality as from the academy awards . \nfurther more , there are other annoying problems . \nto this day no serious filmmaker has dared to speculate about the future in more than 50 years from now . \nthis has not been done for obvious reasons , because the filmmakers are well aware of the fact that they lack the knowledge and imagination to perform such a difficult task . \ncolumbus is the first to have crossed that line . \nthe result is , as you might imagine , primitive , unrealistic and incredibly disappointing effort . \nthe world is simply frozen in time . \nneither the society , fashion , culture or values have changed over 200 years . \nmom is still working at the kitchen , doing the dishes . \nwhen you think back to the late 17th century and then compare it to the world we live in today , you'll see a slightly bigger difference . \ni am not saying that everything should change . \nit is unlikely that the human rights will change , but it's even more unlikely that there will not be any progress in science , technology and fashion . \ni suppose it's possible to watch this as a some sort of bizarre fairytale , but it's really hard . \nrobin williams is hidden behind c and speaking in a robotic way . \nas always he does a decent job , as does sam neill . \nbut it doesn't really matter . \nit is the sentimentality and length that turns this picture into a tiresome experience . \npretty much like last year's \" meet joe black \" , this is a primitive and unresolved story which is presented with a splendor and professionalism that it doesn't deserve . \ngreat actors and a talented crew have worked hard to achieve something that will be instantly forgotten . \nwhen isaac asimov wrote this story , the future seemed far away and magical . \neverything seemed possible . \nnow is the future of asimov's time , and we know that it is not as magical and perfect as it seemed a long time ago . \nfor the same reasons that the young generation of today can not be amazed by julius verne's \" 20 000 leagues under the sea \" , so can't we accept this story as a potential reality . \nlet us hope that next year's \" a . i . \" \nwill be more rewarding . \n", "in the continuation of warner brother's franchise , joel schumacher has successfully killed this cash cow . \nwhat makes this film such a grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film . \navika goldsman's screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another . \nthis coming on the heals of such a marvelously written project as \" the client \" is such a shock that it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was a fluke . \nsituations are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the characters from one point to another . \nthis is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstone's batgirl , who just happens to be alfred's niece . \nthe story of dr . victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue as an afterthought . \nwhile working on a cure for a tragic decease contracted by his wife , dr . freeze is injured during a cryogenic procedure , and becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment . \nnow of course he has become a terrorist intent on turning the world into a frozen planet where only he can live . \nnow the logic of that little sub-plot escapes me . \nif mr . freeze wanted to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death , why would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth . \nthis is indeed a cold hearted man . \nthe development of poison ivy is no less contradictory . \nshe wants to breed a form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal . \nshe joins with mr . freeze in his plan to start a new ice age , destroying all animal life , therefore giving her plant creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them . \nthe characters have no logic . \nbatman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier films . \nnow that he has an adoptive son in burt ward / robin , bruce wayne is trying to be a father figure , constantly spouting out homilies about family and relationships , while at the same time not really having any . \ngeorge clooney tries in vain to keep from rolling his eyes while reciting the dialogue given him . \nto say that his performance is workman-like is to be generous . \nhis best performances are still on \" e . r . \" . \nbruce wayne has the most unromantic evening with his girlfriend ( played by elle macpherson ) , that it brings into question bruce's latent homosexuality . \nthere is no spark and no passion ( as there was for nicole kidman's psychologist in \" batman forever \" ) between bruce and anyone other than alfred . \nand even that relationship is very reserved . \nrobin comes off less charismatic that in the last film in the series . \nnow he's just a spoiled kid . \nin \" batman forever \" , burt ward wanted to be batman's partner and friend . \nnow , robin is suffering from ego deficiency . \nrobin's attraction for poison ivy is not believable , except for a boy around the age of 15 . \nhis later flirtation with batgirl smacks of incest , even though they are not related in a traditional sense . \nchris o'donnell , once considered a rising star , successfully burns up on reentry with this performance . \nhis robin needs nothing more than a good spanking . \nthe less said about alicia silverstone's performance the better . \nthis talented young actress reads her lines with all the aplomb of a dubbing actor for a godzilla film . \nshe was cast strictly for her commercial value and she knew it . \nthis brings us to the villains . \narnold scharzenegger walks through his part with all the concern of someone waiting for payday . \nthe most rediculous scene is during mr . freeze's imprisonment . \nthe guards are at least a foot taller that arnold and yet fall at his hand in one of the most unbelievable fights scenes caught on film . \nit's almost as ludicrous as seeing michael jackson as a gang member . \numu thurman struts and coos her way through her part , showing a growing discomfort with her sex symbol status . \nher poison ivy has all the come hither sex appeal of may west in \" sextette \" ( 1978 ) . \nthe only performances worthy of notice are pat hingle and michael gough . \nthese two seasoned veterans carry their scenes with a dignity sorely lacking from the rest of the film . \nwithout going through the intricacies of the plot , there is one question that always comes to mind with this series ( except for the first \" batman \" ) , and that is how do these super villains manage to hire so many thugs only to abandon them at the final reel . \nmr . freeze is introduced with a team of hockey playing hoodlums that seem to have stepped out of an old kiss music video . \nevery villain ( even the minor ones ) have to have a look , no one can be an individual with day glow paint on their face or some sort of elaborate costume . \nwith this film , warner brothers has succeeded in retrograding the series back to it's tv incarnation . \nthe only thing missing from the action scenes are the superimposed titles detailing the pows ! , \ngwaaaa's , and clang's associated with the old series . \nyou almost wonder if william dozier , producer of the tv series is collecting royalties from this film . \nthe special effects ( by john dykstra ) and production design ( by barbara ling ) are the primary stars of this film . \nand it is a case of extravagance in the pursuit of nothing . \nevery set , from ivy's lair , the batcave , to freeze's hideout is set with enough neon and fiberglass to keep the epa in paperwork for years to come . \nthere is no one realistic set or set piece in the film . \neverything is set for maximum exposure . \nthe special effects have that strange cartoon look that most rushed cgi effects have . \nthere are homage thrown in by dykstra and his team to gene warren and his work on \" the time machine \" ( the growing plant scene ) but these scenes are so wroth with glaring color and art that they are almost obscured . \njoel schumacher has directed the film with no flair . \ncamera angles are poorly chosen rehashing set ups from the old tv series . \nmaster shots pepper the action scenes , destroying any flow of kinetic quality they may have had . \nmr . schumacher is a good director . \none just has to look back on the films \" the lost boys \" , \" cousins \" ( an underrated film ) and \" the client \" to know that . \nbut \" batman and robin \" comes off as a mated made for tv movie . \nthe film has no style of individuality . \nit is the cinematic equivalent to jell-o , pretty to look at , but empty . \nit is unfortunate that this film , even with it's surprisingly strong box office has succeeded in doing what warner's thought tim burton would do with the franchise . \nkill it . \njoel schumacher's \" batman & robin \" is loud , colorful , action packed , and ultimately . . \nboring . \nstars . \n", "long ago , films were constructed of strong dialogue , original characters , memorable plot points , and solid acting . \none of the best examples that hollywood now completely ignore these qualities is found in the new film where the heart is . \nthis opus about the power of love and the redemption of family follows the tragic , and i mean tragic , life of novalee nation ( natalie portman ) . \nhitting the road with her hick , guitar-playing boyfriend in a rusted-out gm , novalee dreams of the blue skies of bakersfield and sipping chocolate milk beneath a plastic umbrella with her unborn baby , due in a month . \nstopping off at a nearby wal-mart for a quick rest , novalee's boyfriend decides to take off and leaves her there . \nnovalee then decides to secretly hole up in the wal-mart ( because she's not the brightest bulb in the stagelights ) . \na wacky librarian ( keith david ) comes to her rescue when she goes into labor one night while she is camped in the outdoors section of the store . \nthen the she moves in with a family , befriends everyone in town -- including ashley judd's character ( who has five kids and still can work part-time as a nurse ) -- fights off religious freaks , survives a tornado , breaks the heart of the wacky librarian that saved her , receives an inheritance , builds a martha stewart-esque house , becomes an award-winning photographer , and manages to always look like she stepped out of a cosmo shoot , all while not once doing anything with her kid . \nthis film is terrible . \nthe directing is awful : it seems director matt williams had an index card with six angles written on it and used every one of them , over and over and over again . \nwe get pathetic and ugly acting by natalie portman , who can do good work . \na disjointed pacing of key scenes and a time structure so confusing that it would throw steve prefontaine off . \na subplot that actually validates the actions of the boyfriend who abandoned novalee in the wal-mart parking lot . \nan embarrassing display of emotions by the characters , making the audience ill . \ntaking two great comedic screenwriters , babaloo mandel and lowell ganz , and forcing them to write drama on par with oprah's book club . \naltogether , it has the feeling of being trapped at home , watching a very bad television mini-series and wishing it to end , only the remote is broken . \nhowever , the main problem with the film is that it never answers the most poignant question brought up : where is the heart ? \nno one ever seems to find it in this piece of junk . \n", "stars : armand assante ( mike

scott ( charles hendricks ) , barry snider ( romero ) , julia barr ( norma childs ) / mpaa rating : r / review : \nin the 1982 updating of mickey spillane's 1947 novel \" i , the jury , \" hard-boiled detective mike hammer is a vietnam vet who drives a shiny bronze trans am , dresses like don johnson in \" miami vice \" with less pastels , and has sworn off alcohol . \nhowever , he still smokes his lucky strikes , detests all forms of authority , and kills at a whim . \nbeyond that , the updated film retains little or no resemblance to the original pulpy page-turner by spillane , probably the most infamous and often reviled of all mystery writers . \nthe movie starts off with a bang : a howler of an opening credits sequence that is a cheap steal from the james bond series , complete with cheesy graphics and an overbearing jazz score by bill conti ( \" rocky \" ) . \nafter that , the movie and the book begin the same , with the murder of jack williams ( frederick downs ) , a one-armed detective and hammer's best friend . \nhammer declares that he will seek vengeance for jack's death , and with the help of his devoted secretary , the blond and shapely velda ( laurene landon ) , and the alternately friendly / antagonistic police chief pat chambers ( paul sorvino ) , he is immediately on the killer's trail . \nhere the movie splits completely from the book , and dives into a convoluted and improbable tale of government conspiracy and mind control tactics involving the mafia , the cia , one of hammer's vietnam vet buddies , and a kinky sex clinic . \nmany of the same characters from the book appear in the movie , but they take on slightly different roles . \nfor instance , charles kalecki ( alan king ) , a numbers runner and narcotics dealer in the book , turns into a suave mob boss . \nand , more importantly , hammer's suspicious love interest , charlotte bennett ( barbara carrera ) , morphs from a run-of-the-mill psychiatrist into the coordinator and founder of the sex clinic . \n \" i , the jury \" is one of several cinematic renditions of spillane's books ( including a 1953 version which was made in 3-d ) , but this film differs from those earlier versions in one major way : it includes all of the sex and violence spillane wrote about that could never be given screen treatment due to hollywood's production code . \nalthough this takes the 1982 version of \" i , the jury \" closer to the core of the original subject matter , it is in this aspect that the film received the most criticism , because it took this new license to extremes that many argued surpassed what was in the book . \nrest assured , the movie not only includes a great deal of nudity , but it is thoroughly violent , especially toward women . \nit features one woman having her neck slashed , a set of twins forced to strip before being stabbed to death by a psychotic sexual deviant programmed by the cia ( judson scott ) , and another woman shot point-blank in the belly by hammer himself . \nno one would deny that spillane's writing has a definite misogynistic nature , but the movie seems to take it a step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment ; its constant equation of sex and violence , much of which is played with the intention of being erotic , is quite unsettling . \nit's no surprise that the movie , like the book , fades to black with a dead woman on the floor . \n \" i , the jury \" had a troubled production and was not well-supported by the studio that made it , which is one explanation why it didn't do well in theaters and many people have forgotten that it was ever made . \nthe script was written by larry cohen , who is best known for his creatively cheesy but nonetheless effective monster movies , like \" it's alive \" ( 1974 ) and its two sequels , \" q \" ( 1981 ) , and \" the stuff \" ( 1985 ) . \ncohen wrote the script thinking he was going to helm the project as well , but he was yanked from the director's chair after only a week's worth of shooting because he was already $100 , 000 over budget . \nhe was quickly replaced by richard t . heffron , who has worked for the last three decades on a handful of undistinguished movies and dozens of television projects . \nheffron was obviously brought in not for his talent , but because he could make the movie rapidly and efficiently . \nit shows in the final product . \ncohen had personal interest in the updated version of hammer , but heffron has none . \nhe shot the movie quickly and clumsily , and although some scenes ring true , most of them are flat , trite , and invariably dull . \nthe movie features numerous car chases , shoot-outs , and stunts , but heffron's background in television is the dominant tone ; despite the graphic violence and full-frontal nudity , \" i , the jury , \" takes on the air of a made-for-tv quickie , with no real punch or depth . \nbut the problems in \" i , the jury \" run deeper than the technical . \nthe central fault in this updating is mike hammer , whose character was lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifties to the eighties . \nbecause spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries in the first person , hammer's character is central to the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona . \nwe never really get that impression in the movie -- there is no first-person voice-over narration and some scenes don't have hammer in them at all . \nconsequently , a great deal of the texture of spillane's storytelling is lost . \nthe period updating turns out to be a detrimentally bad idea because much of hammer's moral code is thrown to the wind . \ndespite his characterization as a hard-nosed , violent , misogynistic killer , hammer always stuck fervently to his own moral code . \nthe title itself , \" i , the jury , \" refers to his anti-establishment notion of being his own law . \nunlike private eyes who seek out the bad guys and then turn them over the police , hammer both pursues the criminal and exacts the punishment . \nin this way , he can be seen as \" above the law , \" but he still adheres strictly to her own personal code of conduct , his own morality . \nthe movie forgoes that aspect of his character , and hammer comes off not only as amoral in society's terms , but in any terms , especially his own . \nif anything , hammer always had his professionalism , but the movie does away with that in the first three minutes by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife of a client who had paid him to find out if that wife was being unfaithful . \nmaybe the scene was intended for laughs , but it only cheapens hammer's character and is , by all accounts , a lousy way to start the movie . \nthe blame for hammer's character can't be laid on assante's shoulders , because despite some unnecessary marlon brandon-like mumbling , he delivers a fine performance . \nspillane never once described hammer's physical attributes in any of the dozen books in which he appeared , so any actor could conceivably portray him . \nof course , because of the lack of written description , those who have read spillane's books will have a strong personal notion of what hammer looks like , and therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectations ( spillane , who played the character himself in 1963's \" the girl hunters , \" is generally considered the best of the film hammers ) . \nthe rest of actors are most un-noteworthy . \nwith the exceptions of alan king and paul sorvino , everyone who appeared in \" i , the jury \" were up-and-comers who basically went nowhere . \nmany of them ended up working in television ( like carrera , who had a short stint on \" dallas \" in the mid-eighties ) , which only adds to the made-for-tv atmosphere of the film . \nmaybe someday , someone will manage to get the right elements together and make an effective film rendition of a spillane book , but this is certainly not it . \n", "nostalgia for the 70s continues , as we see a revival of one of the decade's greatest achievements : the marijuana comedy . \nhowever half baked doesn't quite run with all its brain cells , and will make you appreciate the questionable talents of cheech and chong all the more . \nthe plot follows the misadventures of four ne'er-do-well stoners . \nthere's the group's unofficial leader , thurgood ( david chappelle ) , scarface ( guillermo diaz ) , brian ( jim breuer ) , and kenny ( harland williams ) . \nkenny gets into trouble , when , while on a munchie run ,

the three guys are dealing dope to raise funds , while avoiding the cops and rival dealer sampson simpson ( clarence williams iii ) . \nfor a comedy , the film is pretty humorless . \nnot that it doesn't try . . . it's \njust that the comic setups are obvious and the payoffs nearly all fall flat . \nthe four leads are nearly all playing the same character . \nonly williams stands out ( while still performing on the level of his humor-free comedy rocket man ) , but that is because he's imprisoned throughout most of the film , giving a much needed change of pace ( but mostly swapping one set of obvious gags for another ) . \nto help out , the film is packed full of cameos . \nsteven wright , tommy chong , janeane garofalo , willie nelson , snoop doggy dogg , and jon stewart all make appearances at one point or another . \nnone of them work , beyond the simple \" hey , that's _____ \" level . \nin fact the funniest work in the film comes from chappelle . \nnot as his bland pothead lead , but in his second role , as a pot-obsessed rapper , sir smokealot . \ngranted , it's pretty much a one-joke role , and there aren't a ton of laughs . . . but this film needs every one it can scrape up . \nto top it off , and in a move contrasting with the tone of the rest of the film , thurgood is given a love interest , mary jane ( rachel true ) . \nher role is that of the public service announcement : to inform us why doing drugs ( including pot ) is wrong . \nher character seems fabricated merely as a defense to the \" your film promotes the use of drugs \" camp . \nthe film would have been better off by sticking with the \" rebel \" tone it so eagerly tries to claim . \nyet , in the end , it doesn't really matter . \nwatching the film clean and sober , you are bound to

\ni guess it was all just too much because this turned out to be the biggest flop of the year and it could of been great . \nthe plot : it's new years eve and it's a bellboy's first day on the job . \nhe encounters many mysterious and kinky hotel guests as he tries to handle all his own problems . \ntarantino told his directors this plot , and each of them wrote a script . \nit turned out each of them had written a dark comedy . \nanders wrote and directed the tale about a coven of witches ( madonna , valeria golino , alicia witt , and ione skye ) , which was the worst one out of all of them . \nthe second room ( jennifer beals ) was better , but lacking in plot . \nthis room was about a man who accuses every man of sleeping with his wife . \nthe third room ( antonio banderas ) was the best roomm , about two rambunctous kids that trash a hotel suite . \nthe final one ( tarantino , willis ) was about a movie star wanting the bellboy to chop off someone's finger . \nthe movie was just plain trash . \nthere was nothing here that even makes up a quality film . \nit was not funny , and i didn't hear one laugh in the theater throughout the whole film . \ntim roth is horrible as the bumbling and mumbling bellboy , and he ruins every joke in the film . \nthe supporting cast loses meaning to the word support and the only mentionable actors/actresses are antonio banderas and jennifer beals . \nmarisa tomei appears in a stupid cameo role . \nthis movie is the worst film of the year and the film could have been great , perhaps like a more upbeat \" plaza suite , \" but it wasn't . \nas trashy as it was , some people will call it classic . \ndo you call a man chopping off a finger with madonna's chest showing a classic film ? \nlook for more of ken's kritic korner coming soon ! \nplease check the newsgroups under the movie reviews section for updated reviews . \np . s . \" four rooms \" made number 1 on my top ten worst list of 1995 . \n", "anna and the king is at least the fourth film adaptation of margaret landon's fact based novel the king and i , and it's big , expensive and soulless . \nthough good-looking , its lavish sets , fancy costumes and luscious cinematography can do little to compensate for the emotional wasteland that is peter krikes and steve meerson's script . \nso much money was spent on pretty pictures that they forgot to actually make the movie interesting . \nthis is jodie foster's first movie since the jaw-droppingly brilliant contact came out more than two years ago and it isn't the best choice to show off her acting chops . \nshe's trapped in the stoic role of anna leonowens , the uptight , widowed british schoolteacher who comes to siam ( now thailand ) with her son to instruct the king's ( chow yun-fat ) son in the ways of the west ( because \" the ways of england are the ways of the world ) . \nthe king likes her so much he puts her in charge of educating the whole royal family ( 58 kids with 10 more in the way ; impressive , no ? ) . \nthe eldest prince is none too happy about this ( \" father , have i offended you in some way ? \nwhy do you punish me with imperialist schoolteacher ? ) , but soon gets to know anna and her stern- mother-who-loves-you personality better and comes to like her . \nmeanwhile , siam comes under attack from the neighboring british colony of burma . \nthe king and his close advisors suspect that this is britain's doing which arouses suspicion in siam , putting anna in an uncomfortable position . \nshe is not sure what to make of this and seems to herself suspect british involvement in the crisis but works to diffuse the king's prejudices . \nhe , though self-righteous as ever , can't help but be influenced by the eloquent anna and they slowly , quietly , develop affections for each other . \nthere is a scene in the middle of anna and the king where one of the king's younger daughters dies . \nit's your classic deathbed scene , with the girl's mournful eyes staring at her father , who tries only semi- successfully to maintain his composure . \nanna then comes in and cries a bit . \nthe sequence was there for a purpose : to evoke a strong emotional response from the viewer . \ni'm usually a sucker for such scenes and yet this time , i was just sitting there , my emotions untouched . \nthis remains true through all of the movie which remains emotionally barren . \nwe never develop connections to the characters ; never given a reason to care . \nthis ludicrously long epic was directed by andy tennant , whose last film was ever after , one of my favorites of 1998 . \ni do not doubt tennant's ability to put together a decent movie , but anna and the king , aside from being psychologically inept is also technologically deficient . \nthe sets and scenery are gorgeous , but the camerawork does nothing to convey its grandeur . \neven terrence malick managed to do more with flora and fauna in his otherwise abysmal the thin red line than tennant can muster from $75 million worth of props and a shoot in malaysia . \nwe feel like the camera is restricted to its immediate point of view ; there are no wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms to fill us with larger-than-life awe . \ni liked both foster and yun-fat , who give entertaining if not terribly involving performances in the two lead roles . \nfoster's generally stoic persona serves her well here , as she is playing a reserved , formal and rather underdeveloped character . \nyun-fat is especially effective , perfectly conveying the king of siam's sangfroid permeated with violent outbursts . \nwhat does anna and the king in is its inability to involve the viewer in its characters and situations . \nthe cast is great , the director is talented , and the budget is lavish , but this ill-advised remake of the classic rogers and hammerstein movie is unable to utilize any of those things to form a compelling whole . \nthis is an emotionless costume epic . \n", "robin hood : men in tights is another mel-brooks-produced film in the classic tradition of movies like blazing saddles and young frankenstein . \nmel brooks is well known for his comic look at regular life , his fast paced dialogue and sharp wit . \nunfortunately , robin hood : men in tights has none of the easy going humor of blazing saddles , none of the fun acting of young frankenstein , is devoid of the charm of spaceballs , and is even lacking the good , solid dialogue of history of the world . \nit is , in short , one of the worst movies i have seen mel brooks , or anybody else , produce . \nthe plot borrows heavily from the well-received kevin costner movie of last year , robin hood : prince of thieves . \nthis is not surprising in and of itself , and could have been used to great comic effect , mainly by parodying scenes from the orginal movie . \nmel brooks does not take advantage of this , however , and uses the film to launch several ideas into the air , none of which connect and none of which are explained later on . \nthe movie's scenes could be shuffled around in any order and one would be hard pressed to notice . \ncary elwes , of princess bride fame , plays robin of loxley , a man who was captured in the crusades , fighting with king richard . \nhe escapes and , joining with a man named achoo ( i am sure you can see the obvious joke ) , fights in england to reclaim his name and the throne for richard , which has been captured by evil prince john , played by funny comic richard lewis . \nhe also tries for the love of maid marian and attempts to overthrow the evil \" sheriff of rottingham \" . \na good adventure plot that is sadly unused . \nelwes and lewis are both excellent comics , but the dialogue in the movie is simply excruciating . \nneither actor has any good words to work with , and the lines simply aren't funny , nor believable . \nperhaps the worst example of this is when the group of merry men encounter a man playing a macaulay culkin clone from the hit movie home alone . \nthis particular scene is so out of place and so badly acted , and followed by so many other scenes of equal miserable ideas , that i really felt like leaving the theatre . \nmuch of the audience continued to look at their watches throughout , and some left the theatre . \nchuckles were few and far between , and they mostly dealt with visual jokes ( such as an old , beaten up horse from \" rent-a-wreck \" ) then from any dialogue whatsoever . \nscenes that could have been classics , such as the archery contest , are ruined by poor acting . \nperhaps the largest problem with the movie is that it is simply offensive . \nthe basic plot , that robin has received a key that will unlock the chastity belt of maid marian , is not witty nor funny . \nmel brooks as a circumcision-giving rabbi is also offensive to me and others in the audience ( not all jewish , either ) . \nthe movie simply tries to hard trying to be funny and by and large fails . \nthe addition of a blind man who stumbles around , falling off cliffs , walking into ledges and being a general buffoon could have had some humorous potential , but is also made terribly offensive . \nthe only reason to see this movie is the surprise actor at the end who plays king richard . \nhe is well worth waiting for , if you can stand an hour and half of unfunny dialogue , excruciating visual humor , old puns , ancient jokes and bad acting . \nif you can't , don't even bother watching this miserable film . \n", "with his successful books and movies , michael crichton is doing well . \nwith early successes with westworld ( 1973 ) and coma ( 1978 ) , and recent films such as jurassic park ( 1993 ) , his films have been entertaining . \nhowever , he seems to taken a wrong turn somewhere with sphere . \nthis $100 million mess by good director barry levison ( disclosure ) is dull , long winded , and a huge disappointment . \nconsidering the huge budget , the all star cast , and a story by crichton , sphere is majorly disappointing . \nthe film opens with norman goodman ( hoffman ) , a psychologist who thinks he is visiting an airplane crash to console the survivors . \nhowever , when he arrives , he his told by supervisor barnes ( peter coyote ) that he is actually investigating an spacecraft . \nalong with goodman is mathematician harry adams ( jackson ) , biologist beth halperin ( stone ) and ted fielding ( liev schrieber . ) \nthey investigate the spaceship , find a massive sphere inside , meet an alien intelligence called jerry , and basically weird crap happens . \nunfortunately , something went wrong along the way with sphere . \nthe film starts off entertaining enough , but throughout this very long movie , it just gets sillier and sillier . \nthe film jaunts along from scene to scene , never fully explaining what is going on . \nthe actors and directing don't help , either . \nhoffman is on autopilot ( and almost seems embarrassed ) throughout the movie , churning out dull lines , and probably wondering what the hell he is doing in this movie . \nstone is useless , displaying no emotion , and fails to convince the audience that she has any feelings for hoffman . \nthe only person who seems to be having fun in this movie is jackson , who's funny as the mathematician who slowly goes crazy and entering the sphere . \nbut he's hardly in it , and by the end of the film he is just as dull as hoffman and stone . \nthe same goes for peter coyote , who hams it up as the officer , but is then killed off halfway through . \nthe director , barry levinson , who directed the better crichton adaptation disclosure ( 1994 ) messes up with the drama and the action . \nthe drama scenes are , quite frankly , boring , and the action scenes suffer from overkill , with levison throwing the camera all over the place ( much like the godawful speed 2 , 1997 ) \nthe writing doesn't help much , either . \nalthough crichton is great with plots , he's terrible with dialogue , and practically every line in sphere is a dud . \nthe speech is too simple , i was hoping it would be a bit more intelligent . \npractically every line is just stating the obvious . \nnone of it is smart . \nalso , where the hell did the budget go ? \nthe sphere itself is impressive , and there's a few nice special effect shots , but where the $100 million went is anyone's guess . \nthere's a giant squid attack in the picture , but not once does the audience see the squid , even though the film has a massive budget . \ni assume the picture was trying to build up tension by not showing the squid , and if handled correctly it probably would . \nbut the whole scene is done badly , and i was just hoping we could see the stupid squid . \nfinally , the film has no idea what genre to be . \nlevison can't handle his own plot . \nit leaps from hokey sci-fi , to horror , and finally the shining/event horizon psychological thriller . \nand , of course , the film is very much like the abyss ( 1988 ) , although in it's defense , crichton did write sphere before the abyss was released ( and is far superior to this rubbish . ) \nit's not all that bad though . \nthe plot is all right , there's a few jump scenes ( although nothing very scary ) and there's the occasionally interesting bit . \nbut overall , sphere is a big waste of some fine talent , a lot of money , and a potentially good movie . \nnot really worth seeing . \noverall rating= review by david wilcock \n", "director luis mandoki's last film was the superb , serious 1994 drama \" when a man loves a woman , \" but his luck has ultimately run out with his latest picture , \" message in a bottle , \" which is the worst type of romance , a movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather than tear them up . \neverything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times before---and much better---so there's an absence of suspense , and the film ultimately moves at such a very , very deliberate pace , as if it is trying to make great , \" meaningful \" statements and plot developments , that it just becomes a tedious bore to sit through . \n \" message in a bottle \" begins with theresa osborne ( robin wright penn ) , a single mother and researcher at the chicago tribune , whom finds a bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day . \ninside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed to a mystery woman named catherine , and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it around at her work and , to her objection , finds that her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper . \nsoon , a heavy research is conducted to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and a ship logo on the top of the typed message , and after it is traced to a man named garrett blake , theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks , a boating town in north carolina , to find out the specifics of the message . \nof course , garrett turns out to be a handsome , rugged man around theresa's age and played by kevin costner . \nshe is immediately charmed by him , but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there , and finds that catherine was garrett's late wife who died a few years earlier . \ndo you think you know where this is headed ? \nmost likely you do , and i wouldn't call it giving away anything to say that by the picture's end , the movie has fallen into deep , artificial melodrama that i didn't buy for a second . \nif there are any positive things to say about \" message in a bottle , \" it is that the performances by robin wright penn and paul newman , as garrett's stubborn , but loving father , are far above par to be in such a wasteful , \" shaggy dog \" love story , and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast , and paints chicago as an equally alluring city . \nmeanwhile , costner has yet to redeem himself for some of the less-than-stellar films that he has made recently . \nit seems that with such bad luck , he wouldn't want to make another movie set near water , but here he is again with one of the main , and most ridiculous , centerpieces set on a storm-swept sea . \nthe other actors are all , sadly , wasted , including illeana douglas , an underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the \" friend \" roles , here playing penn's confidante and co-worker at the tribune . \nthe first half of \" message in a bottle \" plays like a hum-drum , trite television movie for the lifetime channel , as theresa spends a great deal of time \" getting to know \" garrett , with dialogue that is not the least bit stimulating or entertaining . \nusually , i am the type of person to practically salivate over dialogue-laden sequences since the film is no doubt trying to develop the characters and their relationships , but here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt \" written , \" and not as if people were really \" talking . \" \nwhen the main characters of a film have very little of interest to say to each other , and are not particularly interesting themselves , you know immediately that you are in trouble . \ni swear that while watching \" message in a bottle , \" i felt as if i had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater ( heck , in actuality i'm not even familiar to the novel this is based on , by nicholas sparks ) . \nalways one step ahead of the characters , the movie ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the tried-and-true hollywood melodrama , the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger of tearing . \nnobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresa's secret , and that several obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after . \nthis same exact problem occurred in last year's very , very similar ( watch this , and you will realize just how similar i mean ) meg ryan-nicolas cage romantic drama , \" city of angels . \" \nalthough theresa is deeply touched by the \" heartfelt \" letter that she finds in the bottle , perhaps the filmakers might have been better off finding a message in a bottle of their own , preferably before filming began . \nit should have read , \" memo to screenwriters : use you brain ! \" \n", "i remember really enjoying this movie when i saw it years ago . \ni guess my memory really sucks . \nthere is very , very little that is funny in caddyshack . \nthe laughs are few , and far between , and what there are really aren't that great . \ncaddyshack , as the name implies , more or less centers on one young caddy working at an exclusive country club . \nmichael o'keefe plays said caddy . \nwhy they cast this unknown , fairly untalented actor in the lead role is completely beyond me . \nthe movie doesn't seem to have a real plot , just a series of scenes that are little more than opportunities for the rest of the cast to mug at the camera . \nthe only real story , if you can call it that , was a subplot involving the mentally disturbed greens keeper , bill murray , who is having his own private little war against a gopher who is ruining the course . \nmost of the marginal laughs come from rodney dangerfield and ted knight mugging and overacting for the camera -- with painfully limited success . \nbill murray is slightly amusing in places , but fairly wasted . \nthe biggest waste of all is chevy chase , who didn't even crack a smile on my face with his character's lame zen-like approach to golfing . \nthere are a few decent scenes involving the interaction between dangerfield and knight , but they are far too infrequent to carry the movie . \ni guess that's what you get for basing a story around an unknown kid . \ni'm not sure what the writers of this thing were thinking of , but i really think it was something far removed from comedy as they were putting pen to paper . \nnothing about this movie works . \nit wouldn't have taken a genius to figure out that this thing wasn't going to fly . \nmost of the scenes just couldn't possibly be funny . \nit's as if the writers where off in their own little brain damaged world . \ni'm sure scenes involving chevy chase and his oneness with the golf ball were supposed to be funny . \nin reality , they were painfully embarrassing to watch . \nthere is a scene at the club pool where all the caddies go wild for the \" hot babe \" of the movie walking by in her bikini . \nolive oil would have filled out this swimsuit better than this girl . \neverything about this movie was just completely implausible as far as the comedy was concerned . \nmaybe if you were drunk out of you mind or high off some sort of illegal narcotic this thing might be funny . \nbut for the rest of us , stay the hell away from caddyshack . \n", "tommy lee jones chases an innocent victim around america who is trying to prove that she did not kill her spouse . \nthe fugitive ? \nnot quite ? this is the plot for double jeopardy , another fugitive copycat without the action , excitement , and good acting that the original had . \nthere are other slight differences besides one movie being bad and the other good ; this time tommy lee jones plays a parole officer not a us marshall , clever huh ? \noh and the fugitive ashley judd was framed by her own husband ( bruce greenwood ) who needed to collect two million dollars in life insurance money not a one armed man . \nboth movies are on video . \nmake the wise choice and pick the fugitive . \nthere are so many flaws in double jeopardy , it is laughable . \nwhile serving time in prison , libby parsons ( judd ) discovers that she can never be charged for committing the same crime twice . \nlearning that her husband is still alive , she decides to serve her time in prison , find him , retrieve her son , and kill her husband if necessary . \nwhen the strict parole officer travis lehman ( jones ) stands in her way , libby decides to break the rules ( who knows why ? ) and continue her plan , despite the fact that if she gets caught , she's going back to jail . \ndirector bruce beresford spends way too much time trying to convince the audience that libby misses her son . \nevery other scene , we are given a shot of libby staring and crying at his picture . \nin an action movie like this , valuable time wasted on these shots takes away more opportunities for libby to get up and do something . \nall that is needed in this type of movie is a short scene in which libby tells herself or a friend \" i miss my son . \" \nnothing more , nothing less . \ndr . kimble of the fugitive didn't look at one picture of his dead wife , his primary concern was to save himself . \nlibby at times shows this same determination but not nearly enough . \nashley judd and bruce greenwood both are excellent actors but if they continue to do movies like this , they will be typecast for the rest of their careers , kind of like their doomed co-star tommy lee jones . \nwinning an oscar for the fugitive must have convinced jones that audiences will never get tired of his i-do-my-job-whether-they-are-innocent-or-guilty roles . \npeople still pay to see his movies and he makes plenty of money so i guess he was right . \nthough i don't think he will win another oscar again . \nthe ultimate mistake in the script is what eventually becomes of libby parsons . \neven if she was excused for disobeying her parole officer , the number of other crimes she commits while on the run are too numerous to count . \nburglary , assault , grand theft auto are some of libby's slipups . \nthe message of the movie is you can break all of the small laws as long as you're innocent of the major crime . \nhopefully criminals won't use double jeopardy as a reference in court for why they are innocent . \nthat would just be plain stupid . \n", "while i am not fond of any writer's use of cheap , easy puns , i am not completely above using them myself when the situation merits it ( witness my review of _pecker_ from a couple of issues ago ) . \nso here goes : the juvenile , college-set black comedy _dead_man_on_campus_ is dead on arrival . \nstrait-laced med student josh ( tom everett scott , who manages to remain somewhat likable throughout ) 's blemish-free academic record breaks out into fs , thanks to the influence of his ever-partying roommate , cooper ( mark-paul gosselaar ) , who introduces josh to the sex- and booze-filled nights that come with university life . \nwith the threat of losing an academic scholarship ( josh ) and a life cleaning toilets for his dad looming ( cooper ) , what are two good-hearted slackers to do ? \neasy--look for a loophole , which they find in the form of an unbelievable rule in the school charter that states that if a student's ( or students' ) roommate commits suicide , the surviving student ( s ) shall receive straight as . \nso instead of studying , josh and cooper attempt to seek out the most depressed student out there , move him into their dorm room , and drive him to suicide before the semester ends . \ndirector alan cohn and screenwriters michael traeger and mike white ( working from a story by anthony abrams and adam larson broder ) take their sweet time to build the head of steam that comes with josh and cooper's diabolical plot . \nuntil then , the usual boring cliches of college life ( booze , sex , more booze ) fill the time , which is made to feel longer by _saved_by_the_bell_ alumnus gosselaar's sitcom-bred mugging . \nthat said , once cohn and company do build some comic momentum , they mishandle it . \nthe introduction of the manic , psychotic cliff ( lochlyn munro ) , a potential roommate for josh and cooper , brings some demented life to the uninspired proceedings before being hastily written out in favor of two less interesting candidates : paranoid nerd buckley ( randy pearlstein ) and british death rocker matt ( corey page ) . \none wishes that cliff would reappear , but , as they say , be careful what you wish for . \nnot surprisingly , he does resurface , and it then becomes clear that this is a character that is best taken in a small dose ; almost immediately , his extended boorish and sociopathic antics loses its novelty . \nthe same can be said about all of _dead_man_on_campus_ . \nwhatever morbid appeal the far-fetched premise has quickly evaporates , and the self-absorbed characters , especially cooper , pretty much grate from the get-go . \n_dead_man_ doesn't grow tiresome ; it already _is_ once the clever opening titles are through . \nas it slogs along to a cheesy , happy-for-all-parties conclusion , _dead_man_ lives up to its title and then some--not only does the movie grow even more tired and die , it still insists on going on . . . \nlike a zombie . \n", "boy , what a great movie ! ! \nkeanu reeves and morgan freeman acting together , the director of the fugitive ( andrew davis ) back again to give us another thriller , and the beautiful rachel stealing beauty weisz thrown in to boot . \nhow could this not be a blockbuster ? \nall die-hard keanu reeves fans , read on . \nol \" much ado about nothing \" plays eddie kasalivich , a machinist studying at the university of chicago . \nto help pay for the rent , he takes on this job making the machinery for a hydrogen project being conducted by the university . \nby happy coincidence , he also happens to stumble on the solution to the final problem and thus is the only one who knows the key to performing this feat of miracle physics . \nthis project holds great promise : taking hydrogen from water and giving out more energy than is put in . \na potential solution to the earth's energy problems without the pollution cost . \nsurely nobody could have any problems with that ? \nmorgan freeman is paul shannon , the project's sponsor . \nhe works for a very powerful organization that disagrees with the paternal project leader as to how quickly technology should be released to the public . \nhe figures the world will disintegrate into anarchy if the results of the project are released too quickly . \nso he murders the project leader , blows up the project ( great but short scene here , sort of like a mini id4 city-devastation thing ) and tries to simulate the experiment at some other hi-tech hush-hush location . \nunfortunately , our intrepid machinist and an english physicist ( weisz ) manage to get away and now follows a fugitive-like chase using a not too dissimilar rehash of that movie script . \nthis movie is just dying for a comparison with \" the fugitive \" . \nboth movies use chicago as the main city and since the place doesn't change much , i guess we can't really blame the setting for the paucity of atmosphere . \nthe trouble here is that where the fugitive had harrison ford and tommy lee jones , chain reaction only has keanu reeves and fred ward . \ncredit to them , but we aren't really given much of a chance to empathise with the characters . \nwhere ford was able to work within the confines of the movie to evoke sympathy , eddie kasalivich just doesn9t seem very believeable and reeves' character is never given the time to develop . \nit might have been a better investment in film to give the characters more depth and spend less time on the chase sequences , which frankly , get quite boring after a while . \nharrison ford was \" the man against the world . \" \nhe was alone in a world where he didn't know who to trust and it came across real well . \nin chain reaction , keanu reeves isn't alone . \nnow that would be fine if the fleeing couple had some chemistry and could really portray some paranoia , vulnerability and confusion . \nwe don't get this . \nwe get him thinking he's still in speed , only now our sandra bullock has an english accent , probably doesn't drive a bus , and hardly contributes anything to the movie . \nthe producers here probably thought , \" hey , what if keanu and rachel don't hit it off too well ? \nlet's rope in that morgan to help us out . \" \nwell , keanu and rachel didn't hit it off well on the screen , and most unfortunately , morgan freeman doesn't help much either . \nthe only thing we come to really know of paul shannon is that he always has a full load of cigars in his cigar holder . \nit's not really his fault . \nonce again , andrew davis just doesn't take the time to build his characters . \nsomeone must have convinced him that this time round , cinema dollars are best earned by making the movie run like a headless chicken . \nthe flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . \n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \n * * * * * perfection . \nsee it twice . \n", "there are those of us who think of leslie nielsen as the bumbling , hapless straight man from the hysterical \" naked gun \" films , crack an immediate smile and forgive him of whatever wavering movie spoof he's committed himself to starring in since . \nthe wavering movie spoofs , however , are less forgivable . \nto be fair , \" wrongfully accused , \" the send-up in question and nielsen's third parody since the last \" gun , \" isn't quite as excruciatingly humorless as his \" dracula : dead and loving it \" or \" spy hard , \" which is a mighty good thing . \nnielsen is still in tip-top comedic form , able as ever to deadpan his way through even the most horrible puns , but he really needs a screenplay that plays off his talents instead of relying on them , and he needs one very soon . \n \" wrongfully accused \" meshes together the premises of \" the fugitive \" and \" patriot games , \" casting its always game star as ryan harrison ( get it ? ) , a master violinist who is drawn into an affair with a married temptress ( kelly le brock ) . \nshe , however , sets harrison up to take the rap for the murder of her husband ( michael york ) - a crime actually committed by a one-armed , one-legged , one-eyed man ( aaron pearl ) . \nharrison is arrested , found guilty and sentenced to death , but escapes from a prison bus , of course , and then is pursued by a determined u . s . marshal named fergus falls ( richard crenna , unnecessarily riffing off of tommy lee jones' already smirky oscar-winning role ) . \nthere's also a mystery brunette ( melinda mcgraw ) and an assassination subplot involving the u . n . secretary general , but like any of it matters . \n \" wrongfully accused \" gets off to an assured start , with an in-concert nielsen , touted \" lord of the violin \" by bare-chested posters , pulling a jimi hendrix on his musical instrument as hundreds of tuxedo-clad mosh in front of the stage . \nnice touch . \nmost of the scenes that follow , however , never top the opener . \n ( hysterical exceptions : the mentos and \" baywatch \" goofs . ) \nmovie parodies are crammed in at an almost-subliminal rate , but most are empty . \nwhen a giant snake lunges onto the screen and snatches a cast member a la \" anaconda \" or baseball players disappear into a \" field of dreams \" -esque cornfield , there's really nothing to laugh at . \nother moments , like an interlude in a fishing shop , are so unfocused that you're not sure what you're supposed to be laughing at . \nthere seem to be more cheap references than frenzied send-ups here , so it's possible that director/writer pat proft , by bombarding the viewer with a careless mixture of the two , guarantees something is sure to stick . \nand what does stick sticks well , particularly the jabs at genre conventions like stylized flashbacks and hard-boiled dialogue , what those \" naked gun \" s ( which proft collaborated on ) did great ; these bits are so on-target that they allow you to remember \" wrongfully accused \" as an almost-halfway-there spoof instead of a lame-brained failure . \nthe movie might have been cursed to begin with , opening fast on the heels of \" mafia ! \" , from proft colleague jim abrahams , and \" baseketball , \" from proft colleague david zucker , but it's a strong possibility that nobody is going to be accusing \" wrongfully accused \" of being nielsen's funniest . \n", "please don't mind this windbag letting off a bit of steam . . . i \njust want to warn all of y'all not to waste your hard-earned $$$ on anaconda . \nit's not even worth a 99-cent video rental . \ndon't listen to ebert on this one ( he has no clue what he's talking about ! ) \nbtw i accompanied my friend to this one because she was * required * to watch it on assignment ( she reviews movies for a local paper ) . \nnow i'll actually back up my huffing and puffing . \nhere goes : \nmovie : anaconda rydain's bottom line : wait for it to come on usa up all night . \neven then , i doubt it's worth the price of jolt ( to help you stay up that late ! ) \nwhy do i hate anaconda ? \nlet me count the ways . . . \nfirst of all , this movie gets way too many snake facts wrong . \nas an ophiophile ( snake lover ) , i can tell you that a ) anacondas would never reach a length of 40 feet , b ) they're scared of people , c ) cases of snakes eating adult humans are extremely rare because human shoulders are too wide to fit in a snake's mouth , and constrictor snakes don't kill what they can't eat , d ) people can outrun snakes with no trouble , especially heavy ones like anacondas , e ) if an anaconda did eat a human , it would need at least 6 months of sitting on its butt to digest the huge meal , therefore it couldn't run around gobbling up everybody else in the cast , and f ) snakes have no vocal cords , so they can't make funny squealing noises . \nwhew . \ni was prepared to suspend reality if the movie would have been worth it . \nunfortunately , anaconda was about as suspenseful and exciting as watching paint peel . \nmy friend and i even successfully predicted who would live at the end . \nanybody can tell the bad guy is going to die eventually . \nthat was a pity because his character was one of the few reasons my friend and i didn't give up and fall asleep . \nhe was the most likable character in the movie . \nwho wouldn't enjoy somebody who looks like a deranged walt whitman ? \nanaconda did have its cute moments : arguments between ice cube's character and the british guy , for instance . \nhowever , those small flashes of wit were not worth the other hour and twenty-eight minutes of boring schlock . \nthe writers had - and blew - a multitude of opportunities to insert funny lines . \ni was quite disappointed with a scene where a young guy tells a young lady that the jungle makes him horny . \ndid she retort with a clever , ego-withering comeback ? \nof course not ! \n \" i'm trying to work ! \" \ngee , that's even dumber than the crap comebacks i come up with . \nshe could have told him to go find a knothole or something . . . \n ; p but i will admit , there was just one scene where i was surprised at the outcome ( hint : it involves the evil guy and miss crap comebacks ) . \nas for the plot , i'm still trying to find one . \nthis movie was basically an excuse to get a boatload of people into dangerous territory where they could get snarfed by ridiculous , computer-generated anacondas with the eyes and fangs of vipers and the faster-than-gravity downward acceleration of a harrier jet . \n ( harrier snake ? ) \nnot to mention instant digestion so they could go snarf countless other victims . \nthe writers tried to throw in some sort of plot twist ( should i call it a plot knot because it made no sense ? ) in which the sick guy's g-friend kisses the evil dude and suddenly everybody hates said evil dude and starts trying to kill him . \nthat was about as clear and understandable as mission : impossible . \n ( if someone could explain that movie to me , i'd be most grateful ! \nall the old-guy double agents looked the same ! ! ) \ni wasn't inspired by the acting , save for the evil dude . \ni can't blame the actors , though . \nit's not their fault they had a cruddy script to work with . \nthis concludes rydain's diatribe on a shameless exploitation ( and perpetuation ! ) of public fear of snakes . \ncomments , flames , anyone ? \n-rydain the atomic cheese , fresh from chernobyl dairies ! \n", "this movie is written by the man who is deemed to be \" one of the hottest writers in hollywood \" . \nhe wrote the groundbreaking screenplay for scream ( 8/10 ) , then added the successful i know what you did last summer ( 7 . 5/10 ) \nscript to his mix , and also created the popular tv series \" dawson's creek \" . \nso when he asked to direct his first movie , based on his first ever script written , everyone and their grandma said \" sure , go for it ! \" . \nuhhm , my question is . . . did anyone bother reading this stupid script ? ? ? \nplot : ace student leigh ann watson is mistakenly caught with some cheating papers by the bitchiest teacher in the west , mrs . tingle , and set to lose her scholarship to college . \nwhen she and her friends visit the teacher at home in order to explain their side of the story , they end up tying her up , and slowly trying to talk some sense into the hardheaded woman . \ncritique : it's not so much that this is a bad movie , than the fact that it sucks . \nthis movie is chock-full of one-dimensional characters , contains no actual humor that i was able to zone in on , zero tension or thrills , plot holes the size of my big ass , lame pop tunes played to mask nothing going on in the movie , and molly ringwald , vivica a . fox and lesley anne warren tossed away in throwaway roles . \ni was primed for this film as its interesting premise had me thinking misery ( 8/10 ) and 9 to 5 , but unfortunately for williamson , he went nowhere with the bright foundation , making references to the exorcist and dr . \nzhivago , which i doubt many in his target market will appreciate . \nhe also forgot about suspense , with all of his characters based on incomprehensible decisions , unbelievable motivations and simply boring us with all of their trite dialogue . \nsure , katie holmes is cute , and her co-star , marisa coughlan , did a reasonably amusing impression of the exorcist ( worth two points out of my three on ten ) , but how can we forgive the biggest one-dimensional character in any film , holmes' rival in the film , mrs . tingle's complete unprofessionalism being let go by all others around her ( are teachers allowed to behave that way nowadays ? ) and a transparent romance between holmes and some long-haired dude , hired to be the poor man's version of skeet ulrich ( who himself is a poor man's version of johnny depp ! ) . \nall in all , this movie was laughable for me , provided me with no insight into anything , demonstrated williamson's genuine lack of directorial skills alongside a juvenile script , and provided helen mirren with a great role to chew into , unfortunately forgetting to give her character any believability , humanity or capacity to comprehend . \nno hip lines , no cheap thrills , just a dull time at the movie theater . \nif you want to see a funny teenage movie , go see detroit rock city ( 8/10 ) , and thank my drunken , sorry ass in the morning . \nlittle known facts about this film and its stars : kevin williamson's father was a fisherman . \nkevin used his knowledge of fishing hooks and winches when creating the killer in i know what you did last summer ( 7 . 5/10 ) . \nhe is also a huge fan of steven spielberg and coincidentally , so is dawson leery on tv's \" dawson's creek \" , a show kevin created . \nhe was once an aspiring actor . \nin fact , he even landed a bit part on tv's \" another world \" . \nalso , williamson has gone on record to say that an unsupportive english teacher who once told him that he would never amount to anything was the inspiration for mrs . tingle , which is also loosely based on the book \" killing mr . griffin \" by the writer of i know what you did last summer ( 7 . 5/10 ) , \nlois duncan . \nhe has also come out and said that he is a gay man . \nhelen mirren was born in london , england under the name ilynea lydia mironoff . \nshe is married to director taylor hackford , whose works include devil's advocate ( 8/10 ) and an officer and a gentleman ( 8 . 5/10 ) . \nthis film was originally titled killing mrs . \ntingle , but was changed after the columbine high school shooting incident . \nactress marisa coughlan will star in kevin williamson next tv project called \" wasteland \" . \nthis is actor barry watson first full feature film . \nhe has played the character of \" seth \" on tv's \" malibu shores \" several times . \n", "in a typical cinematic high school , the football jocks have sex with the girls and then dump them , but not before the boys' scores are dutifully recorded in their little black books . \nas the sexual acts take place , the other guys hang out nearby , guzzling beer and grunting like pigs . \nin the rage : carrie 2 , robert mandel's terminally bland sequel to carrie , there isn't a single original moment . \nonly amy irving returns from carrie , and the talent of the rest of the sequel's cast is impossible to determine given the stupefying mediocrity of rafael moreu's script . \nas rachel , the horror story's lead , emily bergl gives one of the least scary performances in recent memory , but it isn't exactly her fault . \nthe director asks for little from his actors , which is precisely what he gets . \nsporadically in this lame and lifeless movie , rachel will cause school lockers and windows to fly open , but generally she just mopes around looking like a victim . \nher fellow students delight in tormenting her . \nof course , she will get her revenge in the obligatory ending bloodbath in which she will decapitate and castrate the boys and crush the girls with burning timbers . \nas the movie marks time until its big finale , it throws in some repugnant scenes , hoping to turn audience's stomachs . \nrachel's girlfriend commits a horrible and realistic suicide after the boy who made \" love \" to her the night before spurns her . \n ( he gets major points in his black book for this , but his buddies say he would have gotten more if he had had sex with her after her death . ) \neven a helpless puppy is run over , and we see his poor , little body flipping over and over under a truck . \nthe teenagers in the movie are completely blas ? about it all . \n \" doesn't it offend you that some girl offed herself yesterday , \" asks one of the few kids with a conscience . \n \" why ? \" \nresponds his nonplussed girlfriend . \n \" she wasn't anybody . \" \nremarkably devoid of any energy , especially for a horror flick , the movie makes one yearn for a fast forward button on the theater's armrest . \nwith material this bad , the film's only hope is to go for parody , but it isn't smart enough to realize it . \neven the mandatory epilogue is as pointless and predictable as the rest of the movie . \nthe rage : carrie 2 runs 1 : 45 . \nit is rated r for graphic violence , teen alcohol abuse , sex , nudity and profanity and would be acceptable only for older teenagers . \n", "man , this was one wierd movie . \nsimilar to conspiracy theory in that it couldn't decide which genre it is . \nthe first hour is your standard stock aliens clone , which nicely created an eerie atmosphere about the ship . \nthe last half hour ? \nthis was when the makers blew the script out the airlock and just decided - \" screw it , let's just kill everybody \" . \nfrom then on - forget sci-fi . . . this \nmovie becomes 100% horror . \nwhat really dissappointed me about this movie was that it tried to scare you in entirely the wrong way . \ninstead of using clever tricks or trying to build up to a scare - this movie just uses loud noises , sudden camera shifts and short quick bursts of gore . . . . . yawn . . . . everyone's \nseen it all before and knows when to expect it . \nthe one thing that was done well was the lead up to finding out about what happened to the previous crew . \nthere are skeletons lying around mangled and mashed , but what did this ? \nthen finally after being painfully restored - the new crew views the video . \nthe acting isn't too bad at all . . . . . considering what the actors had to work with anyway , as there is no complex or interesting dialogue to speak of . \nthere was some very nice camerawork in certain sequences though , like when the hull near the bridge of the event horizon is breached and the camera pans back to follow specific objects as they bounce across the deck and are sucked out into space . \nthis movie could have been so much better . \nit had a good experienced cast who deserved more to work with . \nthere was just nothing new here that any of us haven't seen before in aliens or hellraiser . \n", "the king and i , a warner brothers animated , musical feature , recycles the classic story of a woman who challenges the heart of a king , with obvious results . \nwhen anna ( miranda richardson ) , a british schoolteacher , travels to saim to educate the king's ( martin vidnovic ) children , she learns that the king is treating his people unfairly , and must say something to the greedy ruler . \nmeanwhile , the king's prime minister ( ian richardson ) , the stereotypical villain , plots to overthrow the king , taking the throne . \nthe last , and most predictable , main subplot deals with the king's son ( allen d . hong ) , and his love for a servant , tuptim ( armi arabe ) , and how he conflicts with his feelings , and the ancient laws of saim . \nnot even the lone strong character of anna can save the unbelievably horrible waste of talent , as the king and i's problems could fill the blank pages of a journal . \ni will only note the major difficulties , for it would take pages to elaborate on every detail . \nthe screenplay , written by arthur rankin , peter bakalian , jacqeline feather , and david seidler , which is based upon the play written by richard rodgers and oscar hammerstein , has some of the worst dialogue written in a film within recent memory , as every time the obnoxious king would shout , \" etc , etc , etc , \" i would cringe . \nliterally . \nspeaking of cringing- i did quite a bit of this during the rather short film , which is a classic display of terrible filmmaking . \nbesides the repetitive dialogue from the king , on the whole , the songs seem out of place , and unlike the lyrics , are unmagical . \nthe sole song which is used cleverly is \" getting to know you , \" which is used as anna shows the children the great outdoors , which they have never been exposed to . \nunlike disney animated features , the king and i's songs don't add to the film , and are as uneffective as could be . \ntake the following scenario as an example , as the sheer horror of the king and i's music is at its worst . \nyou're being hunted by a dragon ! \nwhat do you do ! ? \nsing a happy song ! \nmartin vidnovic voices the king without effort or emotion- you hear the saying two negatives don't make a positive ? \nbelieve it ! \nwith the terrible dialogue that the king has , along with his awful voice track , the king is completely unbelievable , only shows mild signs of any personality , and the only thing that changes in the king is that he says \" etc . , etc . , etc . , \" more and more as the film progresses . \nno personality at the beginning of the movie , none at the end . \nand where does this character's personality change ? \nhey , i thought anna was supposed to change him ! \nisn't that the whole plot ? \nthe prime minister's hideous sidekick ( darrell hammond ) brings his share of cringes as well - oh no ! \nanother one of his teeth fell out ! \nhardy-har-har ! \nhe is supposed to bring laughs for the kidlets , but even at age five i would have cringed while watching him . \nby the way this review is going , you may think the reasoning for my hate for this film is due to not liking animated films- hence why i hate this movie , because the king and i is a disgrace to animation . \nanimated films , such as 1994's the lion king and 1998's the prince of egypt , are among my favorite movies of all time . \nthe animation team does design their share of well animated settings , so this makes it easier to take my mind off of the annoying king , until i realize that day and night switch back in fourth within seconds . \ni have not read the play , or seen the oscar winning , 1956 film adaption , but from what i can tell , the screenplay for the 1999 version completely butchers the play , for the king and i is never magical , nor interesting . \nif it wasn't for miranda richardson , who voices anna with feeling , the king and i could earn the title , \" worst movie of the decade . \" \ninstead , the king and i will just go down as among the year's worst . \nthe bottom line- avoid this movie at all costs . \nnot even young children , the target audience in this film , will enjoy it . \nnot the slightest bit . \n", "synopsis : cro-magnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escapes certain death by a lion . \nreluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggy-style , ayla grows up to become a blond , feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without a mate . \ncomments : allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies . \nshe proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the sci-fi classic blade runner . \nthe clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point : the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title . \nnot even her starring role in this turkey , unfortunately , can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese . \nit's so uniquely bad ( a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries , and miserably fails , to be serious ) that it's oddly fascinating . \nthe ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed , wanting to see how this dud plays out . \nthe clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m . auel . \nto this day , the book possesses a loyal cult following . \ni remember a dear friend of mine had a dog-eared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the so-called dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother . \ni have never read this book , but i sure hope it's 10 , 000 times better than its film adaptation . \nif not , then i'm at a complete loss to explain its popularity . \nthe clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene . \na young ayla , looking much like drew barrymore in e . t . , \ntramps about in the woods . \nwith her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her , the audience's expectations of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered . \nwhat follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up ayla's mother ( a blonde with fur pants . . . er , \nleggings ) . \ntearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera . . . well , \nas the earthquake slowly recedes . \na hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch , but the screaming six-year-old manages to outrun the king of the wild and find a safe haven . \ni won't detail the story any further ; this seems enough to illustrate my point . \nthis movie is really stupid . \nit never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief . \nalso , the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro-magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston . \nthe movie doesn't just suggest this message ; it whacks the message into the audience with a two-by-four . \na blond , gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs . \nshe's of the \" new people \" ; they're of the \" old people \" with \" the memories . \" \nyep . \nwe get it . \nwe get it . \nthe clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make-up , which surprises me . \nthe movie depends upon a lot of make-up obviously , but much of it is unconvincing . \nas stated before , daryl hannah is daryl hannah here ; she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time . \nthe rest of the characters have dark make-up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt . \nthe face-painting that's occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind . \nthis movie also suffers from its new age trappings . \nmaybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during 1985 , but now it sounds dated and cliched , like poorly conceived elevator music . \nadd to this the film's faux-mysticism , including spirit animals and dream visions , and a narrator who sounds like a psychic you'd expect to hear on a 1-900 number , and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious . \nthe clan of the cave bear is rated r , though it's probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films i've seen in quite a while . \nit contains several scenes of sex sans nudity . \nthe violence mostly consists of hunting scenes . \nthe funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear . \nthe bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about . \nalthough this may sound gratuitous , i'm sure , it's so cheesy that it probably won't bother most people . \nthe clan of the cave bear is a bad movie . \nhowever , as i wrote at the beginning of this review , it does have the distinction of originality . \ntypically when i think of bottom-of-the-barrel films dealing with early man , fantasy movies involving dinosaurs ( who did not exist at the same time as man ) and raquel welch come to mind . \nthe clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that , though it's so bad , the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie ( which is why i awarded this turkey two stars ) . \ni have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version ; however , i'm only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie . \ni shudder to think that it could be otherwise . . . \n", "salaries of hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days and many find this to be the main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets . \nactors who demand such salaries might be greedy , but in some instances they are quite justified , because many films would never be watched or even made without their participation . \nproof for that can be found even in the realm of low-budget movies , and one fine example is breakaway , 1995 thriller directed by sean dash and starring ( in ) famous figure skater tonya harding . \nface of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movie's poster , but the main star of the film is terri thompson who plays myra , attractive woman who works as a courier for gangster . \none day she decides to retire , but her employers are anything but enthusiastic about that . \nrealising that her life suddenly became worthless , myra starts running for her life , followed by professional assassins . \nterri thompson being the actual star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure skater . \nalthough tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities , her acting leaves much to be desired . \non the other hand , her disappointing efforts are hardly out of place in the film that lacks originality , believable characters and situations and actually represents anything that gave b-films a bad name . \nmartin sheen's brother joe estevez , whose character looks like he had entered from another movies' set , is the only bright spot of breakaway . \nunfortunately , he appears in this film too little too late to prevent viewers from realising why tonya harding's silver screen debut proved to be her last film . \n", "movies like six days , seven nights make me mad because talented people like harrison ford , anne heche , and ivan reitman put a lot of hard work in to a script worth about ten cents . ? \nthe script was written by michael browning , and he decided that , instead of thinking up new ideas , he'd rehash a lot of cliches , omit even the slightest bit of character development , and then throw in drug-dealing pirates to provide for a few high-level action sequences and explosions . ? \nthere are good scripts out there that high-profile actors can make ( see the truman show , for instance ) . ? \nsix days , seven nights is simply a waste . \nlet's see . \n . \n . \nwe have to get harrison ford and anne heche alone on an island . ? \nso , how do we do that ? ? \nwell , we'll make her a feisty magazine editor , and we'll make him a crusty old pilot . ? \nbut wait , she has to have a fianc ? e ; that can be david schwimmer . ? \nbut wait , if she has a fianc ? e , how will she and harrison ford crash on the island alone ? ? \ni know ! ? \nthey'll get to their vacation spot , and then she'll get called back ! ? \nyessssss ! ? \nso , they'll crash on the island , and that will be funny for about five minutes . ? \nshucks . \noh , i've got it ! ? \nwe'll throw in a distracting subplot in which her fianc ? e has sex with a really attractive woman who acts like a bimbo , and then he can feel guilty . ? \nthen , when anne heche kisses harrison ford ( they have to kiss , because otherwise nobody will want to see the movie ) , it will be a vindicated action , because her fianc ? e will already have cheated on her ! ? \nthen , for no obvious reason , they'll accidentally run into pirates who try to kill them . ? \noh , yes ! ? \ni feel so good about this story . ? \ninstead of using characterization to propel the events , it will be completely random , and yet totally predictable ! ? \nimagine that . \ndon't get me wrong -- six days , seven nights is not a boring picture ; ford and heche both do a great job . ? \nthe sparks fly between them , and so most of browning's inane dialogue is drowned out by the actors' sheer force of talent . \n ? almost every scene between them has energy that the performers bring to the screen , and i found myself laughing pretty hard . ? \nschwimmer is also funny , and manages to milk all of his scenes for whatever he can get . ? \nand reitman , who has made some good films , at least tries to make things exciting . ? \neven though the pirate subplot is profoundly dumb , i was prepared to be pleasantly sidetracked by the action sequences . \nit's just when i start to think about the story that my contempt for this film surfaces . ? \nthe picture feels like it's been hacked to pieces -- i wouldn't be surprised if five or six inept subplots have been edited out completely . ? \nthe ones that are here are as bad as they come ( i think i let out a very audible groan when they get the first glimpse of the pirate ships ) , and i'd just like to shake the producers by the shoulders and scream , \" why did you pick this awful script ! ? \" ? \nthe film is outright stupid , but some of the elements are subtly horrifying . ? \nfor instance , take the subplot in which the schwimmer character has sex with the bimbo , and then feels really guilty . ? \nthis is a serious problem in real life , but six days , seven nights reduces any chance of complexity to a weak plot device : ? his actions are what makes it okay for heche to kiss ford . ? \nin a script that lacks even a glimpse of intelligent subtlety , i find it odd that such a strangely insulting device ended up in the story . \nthis is summer movie season , but that doesn't mean our movies have to be dumb . ? \n1998 so far has been one of the worst years in recent memory for summer blockbusters . ? \nwhen i was in line for six days , seven nights , i heard the woman in front of me ask for \" two tickets to that new harrison ford movie . \" \n ? why didn't she know the name of the film ? ? \ni suppose she just didn't care . \n ? what bothers me even more is that the people who make these big-budget pictures don't realize that their films are becoming parodies of themselves . ? \ngood actors should sign to good scripts , and if hollywood insists on making flicks to rake in cash , they least they could do is assume that we'd like to spend our money on a story worth more than ten cents . \n", "if anything , \" stigmata \" should be taken as a warning against releasing similarly-themed films relatively close to one another . \nof the four supernatural horror flicks released this year , it is clearly the worst . \ni suppose i should have seen this coming . \nafter all , \" blair witch \" thoroughly creeped me out , \" sixth sense \" was mildly spooky , and then \" stir of echoes \" had its moments , but wasn't anything i'd lose sleep over . \nclearly , the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping . \nis it then any surprise that \" stigmata \" is the dullest , most horribly executed piece of mtv-influenced tripe i have seen in a long while ? \nno , not really . \npatricia arquette plays frankie page , a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globe-trotting mother . \nas it turns out , the rosary belonged to a recently-deceased brazilian priest . \nthe priest's church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan ( gabriel byrne ) because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue . \nfather kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs , but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue . \nhis investigation is soon called off , however , when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata , in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ . \nfather kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie' s story , considering she's an atheist , but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself , he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on . \nhe eventually begins to suspect that his boss , cardinal houseman ( jonathan pryce ) , is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church . \nas it turns out , the dead priest had been working on the translation of a \" fifth gospel \" before they were excommunicated . \nthe new rupert wainwright music video . \n . \n . \ni mean film \" stigmata \" is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse . \nindeed , it would have been good if it were a music video , because it's only interesting for about five minutes . \ni'm not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow-motion , double-exposure , and extreme close-ups ( whoaaaaaa ! ! ! ! ) , other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and , yes , he has been to film school . \nhis camera trickery is interesting for a little while , but eventually , it becomes headache-inducing . \nwhat this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue ( such as it is ) , with wainwright screaming at the audience , \" see ? \nlook at what i can do ! \ni'm an ex-cellent dir-ect-or . \" \nmaybe then he'd explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow-motion shots of water dripping in reverse , or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying ( ooh , scary ! ) . \nif there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery , i didn't see it . \njust when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story , here comes a double-exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever . \narrrrrrrghhhh . \n . \n . \nthen again , the superfluous camera trickery wouldn't bother me if \" stigmata \" had a story or characters that were remotely engaging . \nthough wainwright's vanity certainly doesn't help , he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script . \nwhere are plot continuity and character development when you need them ? \ncase in point : frankie page is the character that ( i assume ) we are supposed to identify and sympathize with , but we aren't given any back story on her character , or any reason to like her . \nthe extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard-working hairdresser ( who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building ) and she's kind of cute , so let's start the bleeding ! \nthe fact that she's clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn't help , either . \naccording to frankie page , what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back ? \ngo clubbing ! \nsure , that makes sense . \narquette , byrne , and pryce give it the old college try , but their characters are so one-dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking . \nscenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat , because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable . \neven though frankie page's life is falling apart before her very eyes , she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon . \neven more curiously , he seems to be interested in her advances . \nfather andrew's religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic . \nas for pryce , he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle , \" i'll get you , my pretty , \" for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded . \ntrust me , i'm not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain . \nwhat's worse , after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats , we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction , veers off in another , then another , and ends up being totally incomprehensible . \nfirst of all , the film doesn't even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details . how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary ? \nhow come an atheist like her was chosen , since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata ? \nactually , i'm not sure what frankie was posessed by . \nsupposedly , stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit , but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest , and later by some evil spirit ( i think ) . \nwhich one is it ? \nthe answer to this question , of course , is very simple : the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr . wainwright wants to use this time . \nfurthermore , the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap-up , and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church . \nif you do any research at all about the gospel of st . thomas , you'll find that it is not being suppressed by the church ( as the film seems to claim ) , but that it is readily available at your local library . \nthere's nothing the catholics need to worry about , though . \n \" stigmata's \" religion is so off-base that it can't be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church . \nif they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters , they should have gone all-out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns , which would have been far more interesting . \ni'm not catholic ; in fact , i don 't care much for the catholic church , but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means . \nit's rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as \" stigmata \" does . \nit' s not thought-provoking , though it would like to be , and it is definitely not scary , though it pretends to be . \ni'm not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film , because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story . \nmaybe it's an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever . \nthe initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over , and over , and over . \nlike so many films of the mtv generation , this one suffers from overkill . \nso much is overdone in \" stigmata , \" that it eventually has no effect on the audience , leaving us to pick out the film's ( many ) flaws . \ni'm also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st . thomas is so earth-shattering . \nwhen we finally hear it , the saying sounds like something every five-year-old learns on their first day of sunday school , which means that for all its flash , the whole film is really much ado about nothing . \nthe dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog , and \" stigmata \" is it . \n", "john boorman's \" zardoz \" is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own . \nnot since the rampant bumblings of one edward d . wood jr . has a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time . \nof course , wood's career can be explained by two things : he had no money and he had no talent . \nboorman , on the other hand , cannot court such excuses to explain \" zardoz \" ( or his follow-up film , the equally awful \" exorcist ii : the heretic \" ) . \nboorman obviously had a sizable budget , a matinee idol movie star ( sean connery ) in the lead role , and although you wouldn't know it from this film , boorman does indeed have talent . \nthis is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece \" deliverance \" ( 1972 ) , as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama \" hope and glory \" ( 1987 ) , the slightly over-conceived arthurian epic \" excalibur \" ( 1981 ) and the father-son jungle adventure \" the emerald forest \" ( 1985 ) . \nhis films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination , but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste . \nif boorman is anything , he's ambitious , and when he succeeds , it's in grand fashion . \nunfortunately , the bigger they are , the harder they fall , and when boorman falls , the resounding impact can be heard for miles around . \n \" zardoz \" is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies , an obsession of boorman's . \nhis screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even \" the wizard of oz , \" a book which figures into the movie's plot . \nbut , despite all this reaching , the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling . \nthe events take place in the distant year 2293 , but there is little of the typical futuristic movie-ness to be found . \nin fact , things seems to have moved backwards , with people riding horses , shooting old-style guns , and living in large victorian mansions . \nit's more middle ages than space age . \nthe world of \" zardoz \" is divided into two distinct hemispheres : the outlands , where all the poor , pathetic people live , and the vortex , where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life . \nthese immortals never grow old , they never engage in sexual activity , they possess psychological powers , and they live in a sort of quasi-utopian marxist society where everyone is equal , and everyone contributes equally to the society . \nhowever , if one breaks the rules , that person is punished by being aged so many years . \nif someone breaks the rules enough , he or she is aged to the point of senility , and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals . \none of the immortals , arthur frayn ( niall buggy ) , a squirmy man with a mustache and goatee tattooed on his face , is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed . \nlike \" the wizard of oz , \" he adopts a god-like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head . \n ( this flying head is one of the movie's opening images , and it's a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come . ) \ncalling himself zardoz , frayn gathers a bunch of outlanders and makes them into a group called the exterminators , whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they can't procreate and take up more resources . \nfrom inside his giant , stone head , zardoz bellows seriously laugh-inducting statements like , \" the gun is good . \nthe penis is evil . \" \nthat line alone is worth the movie's cult following . \none day , an exterminator named zed ( sean connery ) , sneaks into zardoz's flying stone , pushes frayn out , and goes back to the vortex . \nonce there , the immortals label him a \" brutal \" and study him like a lab rat , taking great , perverse care in exploring his sexuality , which is a mystery to them . \nthey seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection , and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantily-clad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up . \ni say \" hilarious \" because that is exactly what \" zardoz \" is . \nit is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so ; he made this film with the straightest of faces , although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward , he didn't get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming . \njust looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles - he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper , a mane of hair braided halfway down his back , a wyatt earp-style handlebar mustache , and a pair of thigh-high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker . \nboorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of \" deliverance , \" which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would green-light this effort . \nhe attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera , including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth ( \" 2001 \" ) , whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in \" zardoz \" besides the inadvertent humor . \nsean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971 , and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace . \nhe got exactly that in \" zardoz , \" and it's a wonder it didn't end his career . \ni'm sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements . \nis it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life ? \nis it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing ? \nor is it a social statement , something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates ? \nkarl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary . \ncome to think of it , maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip . \npeople high on illicit substances are the only ones i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than a completely unintentional comedy . \n", "the kids in the hall are an acquired taste . \nit took at least a season of watching their show on hbo before i became a believer . \nmaybe after watching a half dozen kids in the hall movies , they would grow into the big screen . \nmy recommendation is that , unless you are a big fan of the kids , skip the film . \nas it is , their first--and most likely only--attempt at a full length film lacks the qualities that made their comedy work on tv . \na big-budget and glossy production can not make up for a lack of spontaneity that permeates their tv show . \nthe kids go through the motions , but you get the feeling that they arent really having fun doing so . \nand this makes it more difficult for the audience to enjoy their antics . \nbrain candy is a bunch of skits tied together by the story of a pharmaceutical company that develops a new drug to cure depression . \nin typical sketch-comedy tradition , each actor plays several roles . \ndoctor cooper ( kevin mcdonald ) and his team create the drug . \nthen , under pressure from don roritor ( mark mckinney ) , founder and president of roritor pharmaceuticals , dr . cooper releases the drug into the marketplace . \nthe ensuing distribution of the new happy pill throughout the populace drives the rest of the film . \nat about 90 minutes , brain candy still seems long . \nthe best thing about sketch comedy--and the kids are no exception--is the ability to quickly deliver the laughs , then go on to another quick skit . \nbut with the additional set-up necessary in telling a longer , coherent story , the laughs just dont come fast enough . \nstrangely , the show is even more tame than it was when on cable tv . \nthe movie makes several attempts at risqueness--mostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompsons characters--but they seem almost forced ; as if they have to live up to a pg rating . \none of the best bits , though , does make use of thompsons naked buttocks ; we see him charging into battle--going to have sex with some guys taking a shower . \nin the classic of this genre , monty python pulled off this delicate balancing act between plot advancement and punchline delivery for most of the holy grail . \nthe kids , unfortunately , are not up to the task . \nthere are some amusing moments , to be sure , but not enough to make the experience an enjoyable one . \n", "there was a time when john carpenter was a great horror director . \nof course , his best film was 1978's masterpiece , \" halloween , \" but he also made 1980's \" the fog , \" and 1987's underrated , \" prince of darkness . \" \nheck , he even made a good film in 1995 , with \" in the mouth of madness . \" \nbut something terribly wrong happened to him in 1992 , with the terrible comedy , \" memoirs of an invisible man . \" \nsomehow , carpenter has lost his touch , with junk like his failed 1995 remake of , \" village of the damned , \" to his uninspired 1996 sequel , \" escape from l . a . \" those movies , however , look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film , \" john carpenter's vampires . \" \nif i was him , i definately wouldn't want to put my own name in the title . \nit is a sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed as , \" vampires . \" \nthe story is simple . \njack crow ( james woods ) is a vampire hunter who , along with one of his partners , montoya ( daniel baldwin ) , and a prostitute , katrina ( sheryl lee ) , survives an attack from the master vampire , valek ( thomas ian griffith ) . \nsince katrina was previously bitten by him , crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires a couple days later , and crow is hoping to find him with the help of her . \nit seems valek's mission is to steal a black , wooden cross from a roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him . \nmy question is : how many time have we seen this same story played out ? \nwell , the answer is just about as many times as a better version of the story has been made . \n \" john carpenter's vampires , \" sadly enough , is one of the most unscary horror films i've ever seen . \nin fact , there isn't even one suspenseful moment in the whole 105-minute running time . \nthe non-stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed , without any interesting camera work , which is usually a trademark of carpenter's . \nand then we come to the screenplay , which , as far as i can tell , is nearly non-existent . \nthere is no story development , and there isn't even an attempt to flesh out the characters . \njames woods can be a good actor , but he has nothing to do here but to say a couple of \" pseudo \" -clever lines of dialogue . \ndaniel baldwin has some potential , but his character comes off as being very dense . \nand sheryl lee ( faring much better as laura palmer in \" twin peaks \" ) , like all of the female characters , plays an offensive stereotypical whore . \nthere is not an ounce of intelligence , or excitement in , \" john carpenter's vamires , \" which is very disheartening coming from an ex-fan of carpenter's . \nhe has said that he turned down directing , \" halloween : h20 , \" because he couldn't work up any excitement for it . \nand yet , when asked about a \" vampires \" sequel , he said he would be happy to do it . \ni think that's a definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent , not to mention a significant number of iq points . \n", "two party guys bob their heads to haddaway's dance hit \" what is love ? \" \nwhile getting themselves into trouble in nightclub after nightclub . \nit's barely enough to sustain a three-minute _saturday_night_live_ skit , but _snl_ producer lorne michaels , _clueless_ creator amy heckerling , and paramount pictures saw something in the late night television institution's recurring \" roxbury guys \" sketch that would presumably make a good feature . \nemphasis on the word \" presumably . \" \n_a_night_at_the_roxbury_ takes an already-thin concept and tediously stretches it far beyond the breaking point--and that of viewers' patience levels . \nthe first five minutes or so of _roxbury_ play very much like one of the original \" roxbury guys \" skits . \nwith \" what is love ? \" \nblaring on the soundtrack , the brotherly duo of doug and steve butabi ( chris kattan and will ferrell ) bob their heads , scope out \" hotties \" at clubs , and then bump a select few with violent pelvic thrusts . \nthere is one crucial difference , however--these guys speak . \nthat little fact has been used as justification for the film's existence , that the butabis' newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new set of doors for the characters . \nthe doors opened by director john fortenberry and screenwriters steve koren , ferrell , and kattan are new , that's for sure , but they all lead to comic dead ends . \nthere is no story per se , only a loosely structured and linked series of subplots . \nthe brothers literally run into ( or , rather , get run into , as in by car ) richard grieco of _21_jump_street_ fame , and through him they gain entrance into the exclusive roxbury club . \nthere , they meet a hotshot club owner ( chazz palminteri , conspicuously uncredited--can you blame him ? ) , who takes an interest in an idea of theirs . \nmeanwhile , the bros' overbearing father ( dan hedaya ) wants them to stop clubbing . \nwhen doug refuses and the dimwitted steve obeys his father , a rift is created between the two . \nthe narrative messiness of _roxbury_ would have been forgivable if all that went on were the slightest bit funny , but virtually none of it is . \nthe assembled press audience mostly sat stonily silent throughout the entire film , with the one big exception being a big laugh near the end . \nalas , the joke--a rather lazy takeoff on _jerry_maguire_--will only strike a chord with people who have seen that film . \ngranted , a lot of people _have_ seen _jerry_maguire_ , but the fact that the film's best joke is completely dependent on one's familiarity with another film says a lot about _roxbury_'s lack of inspiration . \nthat lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid characters themselves . \nlike too many of the skits on the current incarnation of _saturday_night_live_ , \" the roxbury guys \" is a one-joke sketch that never once suggests that the characters have enough comic life in them to survive outside of the sketch context . \nafter watching one of the \" roxbury \" skits on snl , this is what you come away with from the characters : they bob their heads to \" what is love ? \" , \nbump unsuspecting women , and . . . that's all . \nafter watching _a_night_at_the_roxbury_ , you'll be left with exactly the same . \n"], "labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,
